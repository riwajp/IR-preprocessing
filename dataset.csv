Among them, 74 are women. Department Director Liladhar Awasthi said that 41 expeditions have been granted permission to attempt the world's tallest peak this year. In the same season last year, 414 climbers - 75 women and 339 men - from 41 expeditions had received permits. The government has collected Rs 684 million in royalties from permits issued for climbing various peaks so far this season, a figure expected to rise as more climbers continue to arrive. To ensure safe and orderly mountaineering activities, the Department has established a field office at the Everest Base Camp. In the 72 years since the first ascent of Everest, thousands of climbers have set records, contributing to a growing trend of mountaineers aspiring to reach the summit. Despite the inherent risks and challenges, enthusiasm for climbing Everest remains high. Among this season's aspirants is Tashi Gyaljen Sherpa of Solukhumbu, who aims to summit Everest four times within 20 days to set a new record. To date, more than 8,000 domestic and international climbers have successfully scaled Everest, with record-breaking attempts continuing each year.

For many families in Nepal, this is not a tragic one-off-it's a daily reality. Nepal has made commendable strides in reducing child deaths. In 1996, 118 of every 1,000 children didn't live to see their fifth birthday. By 2022, that number had dropped to 33. That's significant progress. But let's not mistake improvement for resolution. We are still far from the global goal of reducing under-five deaths to 25 per 1,000 live births by 2030. And behind the national averages lie deep and dangerous cracks: newborns dying within days of birth, children with treatable illnesses not reaching a doctor in time, and families in remote districts left to rely on traditional remedies when basic medical care is out of reach. Over half of all child deaths in Nepal happen in the first month of life. That's 27 out of every 1,000 newborns who don't survive their first four weeks. These early deaths-due to infections, complications at birth or lack of skilled care-are largely preventable. Yet too many hospitals lack the equipment, space or trained staff to manage newborn emergencies. Nepal's immunisation campaigns have saved countless lives. Polio was eliminated in 2010. Maternal and newborn tetanus, gone since 2005. These are remarkable achievements. But none of that matters to a mother whose newborn can't access oxygen because there's no neonatal intensive care unit within reach. Nepal's majestic mountains might dazzle tourists, but for a mother in labour in a remote village or a father carrying a feverish child across hills, they represent danger and delay. Many families can take days to reach a hospital-if one is reachable at all. Consider this: Nepal has fewer than 1,000 pediatric beds for over 12 million children. Most hospitals are designed for adults, leaving children without suitable care. In rural areas, only 62 per cent of women receive four antenatal checkups. In cities, it's 76 per cent. Among the poorest families, only a third deliver in health facilities-compared to 90 per cent of the richest. These aren't just statistics. They are mothers giving birth on kitchen floors and babies dying for lack of sterile instruments or skilled hands. Easily treatable illnesses like diarrhoea and pneumonia are still among the top killers of young children in Nepal. The danger isn't just the disease-it's the delay in treatment. Families wait too long to seek help, either because the clinic is too far or because they simply can't afford it. By the time they arrive, it's often too late. While traditional remedies have cultural value, they can't replace antibiotics or incubators. Sick children need real medical interventions, not just hope and herbs. Around 2 per cent of Nepali children live with physical disabilities, yet very few receive the rehabilitation or mental health support they need. The health system was simply not built with them in mind. As a result, these children remain on the fringes-physically and metaphorically. But there is hope-and a model worth backing. The Kathmandu Institute of Child Health (KIOCH), a non-profit founded in 2017, is building Nepal's first dedicated children's hospital with 200 beds. This isn't just about new buildings but a new way of delivering care. KIOCH is developing a ""hub-and-spoke"" system: a central facility in Kathmandu linked to smaller provincial centres. Its first satellite hospital in Damak has already treated more than 140,000 children. That tells us something simple but powerful: the demand is there, and the model works. Technology can help bridge the gap where geography gets in the way. Health workers in rural areas can connect with specialists in Kathmandu with a basic internet connection or a smartphone. Telemedicine won't replace every hospital visit but can guide diagnoses, inform treatments and prevent dangerous delays. If scaled correctly, it could revolutionise how Nepal delivers child healthcare. To close the child health gap, Nepal must invest in a system that works for all children, not just the urban and the wealthy. This starts with building more child-friendly hospitals, especially in underserved regions. Not every district needs a full-fledged facility, but every province must have a centre capable of handling pediatric emergencies. We must also train and retain pediatric specialists-not just doctors, but nurses, therapists and mental health workers. Scholarships and rural service incentives can help keep talent where it is needed most. Financial barriers must be tackled, too. Health insurance should cover all pediatric emergencies so that no parent must choose between feeding their family or saving their child's life. For families in remote areas, transportation costs must be subsidised. If we can't bring the hospital closer to the child, let's help the child get there. And let's not forget the most overlooked: children with disabilities. Facilities must include physiotherapy and mental health services, and health workers must be trained to meet the needs of children living with disabilities. Inclusion should be built into every level of planning. Investing in child health isn't just the right thing to do-it's also smart. Healthy children learn better, earn more and contribute to society in ways that pay dividends for generations. With nearly 40 per cent of Nepal's population under 18, this is not a side issue. It is our nation's future. Every day we delay, another 33 children die-needlessly. Nepal has shown it can win big health battles before. It's time to bring that same resolve to the fight for every child's right to survive and thrive. Let's not allow geography or poverty to determine who gets to grow up.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/at-least-16-dead-in-flooding-and-tornadoes-as-storms-slash-from-texas-to-ohio,At least 16 dead in flooding and tornadoes as storms slash from Texas to Ohio,,2025-04-06 22:25:55,"DYERSBURG, APRIL 6 Another round of torrential rain and flash flooding came Saturday for parts of the South and Midwest already heavily waterlogged by days of severe storms that also spawned deadly tornadoes. Forecasters warned that rivers in some places would continue to rise for days. Day after day of heavy rains have pounded the central U.S., rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies in from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service said dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach what the agency calls "" major flood stage,"" with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible. At least 16 weather-related deaths have been reported since the start of the storms, including 10 in Tennessee. A 57-year-old man died Friday evening after getting out of a car that washed off a road in West Plains, Missouri. Flooding killed two people in Kentucky - a 9-year-old boy swept away that same day on his way to school, and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a fully submerged vehicle in Nelson County, authorities said. Also Saturday a 5-year-old died at a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a weather-related incident, according to police. No details were immediately provided. Tornadoes earlier in the week destroyed entire neighborhoods and were responsible for at least seven of the deaths. And interstate commerce is affected - the extreme flooding across a corridor that includes the major cargo hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather. The outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts - twice that of just a decade ago. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday that the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) in 24 hours and would continue to swell for days. ""We expect this to be one of the top 10 flooding events in Louisville history,"" he said. Flash flood threat looms over many states Flash flood emergency and tornado warnings continued to be issued Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, with more heavy rains and damaging winds in the mix. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning. Hundreds of Kentucky roads across the state were impassable because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides. Downtown Hopkinsville, Kentucky, reopened in the morning after floodwaters from the Little River receded, giving a much-needed reprieve, but still more rainfall was on its way, Mayor James R. Knight Jr. said. ""We got a little rain, but most of it went north of us,"" Knight said. ""Thank goodness on that. Gave us a little break."" In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the rising Licking River. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years ago when the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed. In Arkansas, weather officials pleaded with people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary due to widespread flooding. BNSF Railway confirmed that a railroad bridge in Mammoth Spring was washed out by floodwaters, causing the derailment of several cars. No injuries were reported, but there was no immediate estimate for when the bridge would reopen. Why so much nasty weather? Since Wednesday, more than a foot of rain (30.5 centimeters) has fallen in parts of Kentucky, and more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) in parts of Arkansas and Missouri, forecasters said Saturday. Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. At least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. One, near Blytheville, Arkansas, lofted debris at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers) high, according to NWS meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state's emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding. In Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities. Among them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage. ""I grabbed all my stuff and came here,"" said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications: ""I don't leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/environment/earths-storage-of-water-in-soil-lakes-and-rivers-is-dwindling-and-its-especially-bad-for-farming,"Earth's storage of water in soil, lakes and rivers is dwindling. And it's especially bad for farming",Associated Press,2025-03-28 14:06:03,"University of Melbourne hydrology professor Dongryeol Ryu and his collaborator Ki-Weon Seo were on a train to visit Ryu's family when they found something startling. Stopped at a station for technical issues, Seo had pulled out his computer to pass the time with some work when a result popped up in their data that Ryu could hardly believe: It suggested a ""remarkable"" amount of Earth's water stored on land had been depleted. ""At first we thought, 'That's an error in the model,'"" Ryu said. After a year of checking, they determined it wasn't. Their paper, published Thursday in the journal Science, finds that global warming has notably reduced the amount of water that's being stored around the world in soil, lakes, rivers, snow and other places, with potentially irreversible impacts on agriculture and sea level rise. The researchers say the significant shift of water from land to the ocean is particularly worrisome for farming, and hope their work will strengthen efforts to reduce water overuse. Earth's soil moisture dropped by over 2,000 gigatons in roughly the last 20 years, the study says. For context, that's more than twice Greenland's ice loss from 2002 to 2006, the researchers noted. Meanwhile, the frequency of once-in-a-decade agricultural and ecological droughts has increased, global sea levels have risen and the Earth's pole has shifted. Ryu and his colleagues used three different data sources to verify that Earth storing less water on land than it once did. He also said their results reveal a deeper truth about the land, one farmers have to contend with frequently: When a big, dramatic rainfall event comes after a drought, sometimes leading to huge floods, that doesn't mean the water stored underground has recovered. ""It seems that lands lost their elasticity to recover the previous level,"" he said. Whether that elasticity ever returns will depend on whether humans take action on climate change and significantly change water use, the researchers say. The increasing heat stress on plants means they need more water. Agriculture, particularly irrigated agriculture, continues to draw up more water than it can afford. And humans are continuing to emit greenhouse gases without a strong effort to reverse course. ""There are long-term climate changes that have happened in the past and presumably could occur in the future that could reverse the trend described, but probably not in our lifetimes,"" said Katharine Jacobs, a University of Arizona professor of environmental science who wasn't involved in the study. ""Because greenhouse gases will continue to cause global warming well into the future, the rate of evaporation and transpiration is not likely to reduce any time soon."" The study also confirms an explanation for a slight wobble in the rotation of the Earth - it's being driven by the changing moisture levels of the planet. ""When I read this thing, I was very excited,"" said Luis Samaniego, a professor of hydrology and data science at the University of Potsdam who wrote an overview commentary discussing the findings in Science. ""It's a fascinating puzzle of all disciplines that came at the right moment to verify something that was not possible before."" But Samaniego stressed that the finding isn't only fascinating; it's a wake-up call. Imagine the planet's wobble like an electrocardiogram for the Earth, he said. Seeing this result is like detecting an arrhythmia. Choosing not to listen to the doctor - ""that's what we are playing around with at the moment,"" he said.","the, earth, water, wobble, ryu, elasticity, university, moisture, data, science, agriculture, planet, researchers, study, sea, katharine, electrocardiogram, overuse, weon, gigatons"

The voice on the other end was urgent: ""There's a body of an otter floating by the riverbank."" As a program associate at the Freshwater Program under the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in Tikapur, Kailali, Kapali knew this was a serious matter. Without hesitation, he rushed to the site. When he arrived, the body had already been pulled to shore by the local monitoring group. With a heavy heart, Kapali approached, preparing for the worst. However, upon closer inspection, he exhaled in relief. ""It's not an otter,"" he announced. ""It might be a dog or another wild animal."" He explains that otters can be identified by their unique tails, which are typically long and muscular, helping them swim and paddle efficiently in the river. However, this one has a thin tail, which is unusual for an otter. The group was surprised, but their diligence was not in vain. The fact that they had promptly reported a suspected otter death highlighted their dedication to the conservation efforts underway. A disappearing presence Otters, members of the mustelid family, are shy, elusive creatures. Nepal hosts three otter species: the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), the smooth-coated otter (Lutra perspicillata), and the small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus). The smooth-coated otter, the primary focus of conservation efforts, is found along the Karnali River and its tributaries. Though once abundant, their numbers have dwindled, with many locals claiming they were far more common in their grandparents' time. Although smooth-coated otters are recorded in areas like Karnali, Bardia National Park, and Shuklaphanta National Park, their exact distribution remains unclear due to limited surveys. Listed on the IUCN Red List, their populations are believed to be declining, particularly in the western channel of the Karnali River. Fishermen like Arun Sonaha, 27, from Rajapur, recall days when otters could be seen, playing and fishing alongside them. ""They were not afraid of us,"" he says. ""But now, it's rare to see even one."" The decline of otters is attributed to habitat destruction, pollution, overfishing, and retaliatory killings by fishermen who see otters as competition. Conflict and coexistence For generations, the Sonaha and Tharu communities have relied on the Karnali River for their livelihood. Fishing is a deeply rooted tradition, but it has led to unintended consequences. Otters, drawn to the easy meals, frequently enter dhaduwa (overnight fish traps) to eat the trapped fish, damaging the nets in the process. This has led to frustration and retaliatory actions, including the killing of otter pups and the destruction of their nests. ""In my grandfather's time, otters used to hold some cultural significance due to their perceived similarities with Guruwa - traditional healers or shamans of the Tharu communities,"" Ram Swarup Chaudhary, a staffer at the Dolphin Conservation Center of WWF in Bhanjani, Kailali said. He shared his grandfather's observations: ""Among a group of otters, one would dance or move along the riverbank while the others remained still. When the dancing otter entered the river, the rest would follow. This behavior resembled the rituals of the Guruwa. Ram Swarup recalled that during his grandfather's and father's time, otters were abundant in the western channel of the Karnali River and were frequently sighted by fishermen. While hunting and poaching for otter fur were rare, retaliatory attacks were more common. ""Some households still keep otter fur, believed to have medicinal and healing properties,"" he added. Today, however, otter sightings have become rare. ""I have never seen one myself,"" Ram Swarup admitted. ""Most sightings are reported by fishermen who work during dawn and dusk, when otters are most active."" According to Kapali, the decline in otter populations is largely due to the diminishing fish stocks in the Karnali River, caused by overfishing, pollution, and riverbed mining, which destroy and damage otter habitats. ""To protect the otters and their habitats, it is essential to address the over-dependence of local communities on the river for their livelihoods, which has contributed to the decline in fish populations and other ecological issues."" Community-led conservation efforts To address these challenges, WWF Nepal, in collaboration with local partners, has launched the project ""Strengthening Communities' Livelihood and Stewardship to Conserve Otters in Karnali."" Funded by the UK Government through the Darwin Initiative, the project aims to reduce local dependence on river resources by providing alternative livelihood options. It targets six conservation hotspots, forming 15 Community River Stretch Management Groups (CRSMGs) with 375 members-68% of whom are women. It focuses on community-based river management, livelihood diversification, and otter habitat conservation. Its goals are to protect otter populations and improve the lives of the indigenous Tharu and Sonaha communities through livelihood diversification. To ensure sustainability, each CRSMGs monitor a 1–2.5 km stretch of the river, advise fishermen on sustainable practices, and document fish populations. Their advice includes using larger mesh nets to prevent juvenile fish from being caught, allowing fish stocks to replenish. ""We can only advise, not enforce,"" admitted Buddhisingh Tharu from the Himal Community River Stretch Management Group. ""But we see change. Around 50 fishermen have already switched to larger mesh nets."" To raise awareness, the project launched an otter mascot named ""Sakhi"" (meaning ""friend"" in Tharu) and selected 45 Otter Champions to lead community-based conservation efforts. These initiatives aim to reduce the reliance of the Sonaha and Tharu communities on river resources, particularly unsustainable fishing practices. It provides training, technical support, and access to finance for market-based enterprises, helping communities diversify their livelihoods. Building new futures Arun Sonaha, also one of the otter champions, echoed this sentiment. ""Fishing is our tradition, but we must be responsible. I've seen the decline myself. I used to catch large fish easily; now, even a one-kilogram catch is rare."" Kapali frequently receives reports from ""Otter Champions""-local youth conservationists trained by the project. Arun, who lives along an otter hotspot, often provides valuable insights. Camera traps placed based on his tips have captured evidence of otter activity, although the animals' sensitivity to infrared makes them hard to record. ""We see them at night while fishing,"" Arun noted. ""They do their thing, we do ours. We rarely interfere. But there are fewer now. Human activity has disrupted their habitat."" Thanks to the project's livelihood diversification program, Arun has opened a riverside restaurant, reducing his reliance on fishing. Like Arun, the project has also provided sustainable livelihood alternatives to other families that were once heavily reliant on the river's resources. These families are now embracing new opportunities through the project's livelihood diversification programs, which help relieve the pressure on the river's resources and contribute to the conservation of otter habitats. One such beneficiary is Sudha Chaudhary, 45, from Geruwa, Bardiya. Previously reliant on seasonal vegetable farming and fishing, her life changed after participating in a three-month training program. Held once a week, the training equipped her with knowledge of commercial farming, including crops like chilies, cucumbers, and black-eyed peas, as well as tunneling techniques. Last year, Sudha planted chilies and earned a profit of Rs 50,000-greatly relieving her family, which had struggled to fund the education of her four daughters. Two of them study in Kathmandu, one pursuing chartered accountancy, another in Nepalgunj, while the youngest remains at home. Unlike previous years, when the family had to take loans for their education, Sudha could now support them with her earnings. ""This project has been a lifesaver for people like us who were overly dependent on the river's limited income. I haven't had to go fishing in a long time,"" she said. The project provided seeds, plastic for tunnels, pesticides, and market access. Samjhana Sonaha, 45, shares a similar story. Once dependent on the river, she now runs a restaurant in Bardiya. ""Business has its ups and downs, but using my skills for a stable livelihood is better than struggling with unpredictable fishing,"" she recalls. She remembers a time when she couldn't sell the fish she had prepared. Today, despite occasional slow days, her business provides stability for her family of six. Her son, who used to migrate to cities in Nepal and India for work, now helps manage and expand the restaurant. Since opening the business, she has barely returned to the river, where her family once spent most of their time. Kapali explained that families like Sudha's and Samjhana's were selected for the program based on their heavy reliance on fishing and their dependence on the river for survival. In Himalipur, Rajapur-1, Bardiya, a group of seven has started collective fish farming with project support. They received fish fry and feed from the program. In their first year, they sold 166 kg of fish. Chot Lal Sonaha, 52, chair of the Jharana group, said, ""Although fish are usually ready in nine months, we managed to sell ours within seven months."" Nearby, Bhelahi Sonaha, 70, another beneficiary, tends to the goats she received through the project. Bhagawati Shah, chairperson of the Sharad Saana Kishan Cooperative, noted significant improvements among beneficiaries. Her cooperative, one of three receiving project investments of Rs 7 lakh each, provides Rs 40,000 loans at a 6% interest rate without collateral. So far, 23 people have availed themselves of these loans, with around 100 eligible. Beneficiaries include those starting businesses and those needing additional capital. In total, over 300 people from 15 CRSMGs and 375 members will benefit from the cooperatives. Loans support ventures such as goat farming, fish farming, pig farming, vegetable cultivation, and small businesses like paan shops. ""Most recipients lived along the river and depended on it for their livelihood. Now, their focus has shifted to business, reducing their reliance on fishing,"" Shah explained. In Rajapur-3, 18 women are engaged in plant-based handicrafts. After an initial 15-day training program, they received an additional one-month advanced course to meet market demands. ""At first, they made traditional designs, but we introduced advanced training to align with market needs, such as producing trendy laundry baskets,"" Kapali said. Maiti Tharuni, 60, one of the artisans, displayed a traditional plant-based basket. ""We've always had these skills, but now we've learned modern techniques. We can't even meet market demand,"" she shared. While small items take 30 minutes to craft, complex designs require up to four days. ""Now, we're so busy with handicraft production that we don't have time for fishing,"" she added. Kapali emphasized the project's role in providing raw materials and market access. ""We assured them that if they couldn't sell locally, we would buy their products. Now, they supply both local markets and Kathmandu through the project."" The project also offers training in cucumber farming and tailoring. Currently, 15 trainees are undergoing tailoring training, with sewing machines to be provided upon completion. ""If they choose to start a business, they'll receive additional support, provided they contribute some investment. We don't offer full financing because personal investment fosters commitment and ownership,"" Kapali added. A sanctuary for otters Another major initiative is establishing a protected fish sanctuary where fishing will be restricted. While Tikapur Municipality has implemented fishing regulations, gaps remain regarding protected water zones. ""We are working on guidelines in Rajapur to create a fish sanctuary, enhancing biodiversity conservation in the western Karnali River,"" Kapali said. Since a complete fishing ban is impractical, the focus is on seasonal restrictions to allow fish populations to recover, benefiting both otters and local communities. The initiative also aims to ban small-mesh nets to prevent juvenile fish from being caught prematurely. ""We seek to establish an area free from ecological damage, a true sanctuary for otters, dolphins, and other aquatic species,"" Kapali concluded. The smooth-coated otter is a focal species in WWF Nepal's current strategic plan. To ensure its conservation, WWF Nepal is working closely with local communities to develop a community-based monitoring protocol and raise awareness through targeted conservation programs. The project in Kailali, launched in June 2023, is a collaboration between the Nepal Government, WWF Nepal, and local partners: Sonaha Bikash Samaj (SBS), Freed Kamaiya Women Development Forum (FKWDF), Dolphin Conservation Center (DCC), and Small Mammals Conservation and Research Foundation (SMCRF).","otter, fish, conservation, the, sonaha, livelihood, river, their, otters, farming, fishing, program, community, wwf, lutra, project, stretch, karnali, tharu, populations"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/home/pet-recycling-facility-comes-into-operation-in-bharatpur,PET recycling facility for green bottles begins operations in Bharatpur,Sandeep Sen,2025-04-20 13:14:27,"BHARATPUR, APRIL 20 A PET recycling facility capable of processing green plastic bottles has come into operation in Jagannath Chowk, Bharatpur Metropolitan City-4. Established under Project CAP (Collaborative Approach for Preventing Plastic Leakages in Rivers of Nepal), the plant can process colored plastic bottles previously considered non-recyclable domestically, according to Creasion Ventures Inc. Pvt. Ltd. Built at a cost of around Rs 13 million, the facility is currently operating at 30 percent capacity in the test phase and has employed 19 people. It is expected to become fully functional within a month and provide employment to around 35 people, with the number likely to rise to 45–50 once the products are ready for export, the facility said. The factory has been set up on one bigha of leased land for a period of 10 years. It collects plastic bottles from across the country, with a special focus on bottles discarded in rivers. With nearly 20,000 tons of plastic flowing into rivers annually, the venture seeks to reduce riverine pollution at the source and promote a circular economy. The initiative has also engaged members of the indegineous Bote community, who are now earning extra income by collecting plastic waste from rivers and selling it to the factory. Bote are river people who primarily live in Bharatpur, Chitwan. Their major profession is primarily fishing-related. The formal inauguration of the facility was held last Friday. The event was organised by CREASION Nepal, the implementing partner of Project CAP in Nepal, and attended by national and international representatives. Among those present were Director General of SACEP Norbu Wangchuk, UNOPS Nepal Country Director Komal Karki, and Task leader of PLEASE Project and Senior Environmental Specialist at the World Bank Joseph Ese Akpokodje, among others. ""Plastic pollution is a major crisis in South Asia, and through this project, we have been able to contribute to the solution. This is a significant initiative, and we hope Nepal will continue to carry it forward, contribute further, and ensure its sustainability. The funds have been very well spent in Nepal,"" Akpokodje said. CREASION Nepal President Aanand Mishra, who chaired the event, said ""This was a project that once seemed impossible, yet we completed it within a limited timeframe. It was made possible through collective effort. Moving forward, we plan to expand the factory's capacity beyond PET recycling."" The factory uses a step-by-step process to recycle the collected bottles. According to Lila Paudel, Environment Safeguarding Officer at CREASION Ventures, the bottles are first collected and the collected bottles are stacked and crushed into cube shapes to make them easier to transport before being sent to the factory. There, they are placed on conveyors which will remove the labels and caps. At the next station, six workers sort out leftover labels and other waste before the bottles are shredded into flakes. These are then cleaned using both cold and hot washers. As many of the collected bottles come from landfill sites, the washing process is thorough. The water used is treated and reused, and any leftover waste is compressed into cake-like cubes and sent to landfills. The factory claims to follow all environmental safety measures, including limiting noise levels within government standards. The facility produces three main products-plastic flakes, granules, and green straps. The green straps, made from already-coloured bottles, are described as hardy and durable. Previously imported, these are now being produced locally for the first time. In addition to recycling green PET bottles - a first in Nepal - the plant ensures that labels and caps are also sent to relevant recycling facilities, making the entire process environmentally responsible. Project CAP is funded by the PLEASE (Plastic Free Rivers and Seas for South Asia) Project and supported by the South Asia Co-operative Environment Programme (SACEP), the World Bank, and UNOPS.","bottles, plastic, creasion, pet, recycling, the, bharatpur, project, factory, green, facility, aanand, ese, komal, straps, akpokodje, waste, unops, labels, environmental"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/uk-minister-launches-new-uk-nepal-development-portfolio,UK minister launches new UK-Nepal development portfolio,Himalayan News Service,2024-02-21 12:41:59,"KATHMANDU, FEBRUARY 20 UK Minister of State for Development and Africa Andrew Mitchell visited Nepal on 19-20 February and announced a new development portfolio. New UK Development Portfolio will help Nepal to tackle the climate crisis, mobilise international finance for development, deliver economic transformation, and support governance and inclusion, according to a press release issued by the British Embassy here today. UK development support will see £400 million ($505m) in grants delivered by 2030 which will help create 13,500 jobs, attract more than $1 billion in investment and support access to quality health and education services for two million women and girls. A new £400m development portfolio will mobilise vital private sector funding in development, tackle the climate crisis and support economic growth in Nepal. The plan will support the creation of 13,500 jobs, help Nepal attract over $1 billion in investment, and deliver access to quality health care and education services for two million women and girls by 2030. Its focus on long-term, systemic transformation emphasises the UK's commitment to supporting sustainable and inclusive development globally, as set out in the recently published White Paper. Minister Mitchell said: The UK and Nepal share close bonds, cemented by 'our' deep history as Nepal's oldest partner. We also share an ambition to secure a more resilient and prosperous future for Nepal. ""During my visit I saw how the UK is helping marginalised communities, building climate resilience and a sustainable economic transformation for Nepal, he added. ""Our new development portfolio, Mitchell said, will help Nepal on that journey and mobilise the funding needed to support growth and development. This is part of a partnership fit to respond to the challenges and opportunities during the next hundred years of UK-Nepal friendship, he added. In a speech at the Ministry of Finance, the UK Minister set out on how the UK will work with Nepal to help mobilise development funding, tackle the climate crisis and build business, to support Nepal's expected transition from Least Developed Country status. Improved access to sustainable local infrastructure, a key element of that transition, is expected to benefit 1.7million people across the country. After signing the Development Portfolio at the Finance Ministry, Minister Mitchell said bonds forged on the battlefields with the Gurkhas – who are so rightly famed for their extraordinary courage – date back two centuries and those admirable soldiers epitomise the deep and lasting friendship between the UK and Nepal, a friendship that continues to evolve and shape our future together. ""When I last visited Nepal, over a decade ago, you were still recovering after a decade of civil war. Today, we are witnessing the fruits of progress. Ninety-two per cent of people have access to electricity from 67 per cent in 2011. Literacy rates have jumped from 66 per cent to 76 per cent. Infant mortality is nearly one third of what it was 25 years ago. You have made huge strides in economic growth,"" Mitchell said. Millions are engaging in the new democratic system. Not just at home but abroad, Nepal is also showing it is a model citizen – whether defending the UN Charter on Ukraine or as a peacekeeping superpower, he added. Stating that Nepal's progress has been remarkable, the minister said, but Nepal still faced challenges and 'we' need to work together to solve them together. In December, I set out a clear UK vision for development that will help us, together, get our sustainable development goals back on track, Minister Mitchell said. We're committed to expand this and support the government's investment summit – though I stress how vital it is that investors have the right environment. For example, legal reforms and ensuring all actions needed to avoid the Financial Action Task Force's grey-list. Our third offer focuses on women and girls: I've always said that to understand development, you need see the world through the eyes of women and girls. He said his visit was just part of the UK's lasting, and sustained engagement with Nepal. Now is the time, just before the Investment Summit that Nepal is holding at the end of April, that we can see real progress made with the laws that are going through your Cabinet and your Parliament are clearly set in action, put in place, to assure the private sector that here is a welcoming environment in which they can take pride and prosper, Minister Mitchell added. During his visit, Minister Mitchell held talks with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Foreign Minister NP Saud and Finance Minister Prakash Sharan Mahat. Together they affirmed UK support for Nepal's Investment Summit in April 2024, and discussed the reforms necessary to mobilise finance and attract investors. As part of the new portfolio, Minister Mitchell welcomed the recent agreement by Nepal's Cabinet on new programmes that will support green and inclusive growth, attract foreign direct investment, and promote more inclusive business. While in Nepal, Minister Mitchell visited the Upper-Trishuli-1 Hydropower project to see the impact of nearly $22m of British International Investment (BII) funding. This investment will provide clean and reliable energy to millions of people, while boosting economic growth by creating jobs, the British Embassy said in its release, adding that supporting multilateral development banks and development finance Institutions to adopt new business models and mobilise more investment remains a key priority for the government. Minister Mitchell also saw how UK investment is supporting job creation and entrepreneurship at Upaya, Nepal's first tech-enabled transportation logistics provider, and with the Youth Innovation Lab who are harnessing digital technology to build Nepal's disaster resilience. Minister Mitchell saw first-hand the threats of climate change in the Hindu Kush Himalaya, and how the UK is helping Nepal manage climate risk. This includes through the £274 million Climate Action for a Resilient Asia (CARA) programme, supporting the Integrated Centre for International Mountain Development (ICIMOD) to promote a more climate resilient and inclusive Hindu Kush Himalaya. At the One-Stop Crisis Management Centre at Lumbini Province Hospital, the minister saw how UK funding is improving support to survivors of gender-based violence. He also discussed how the UK is supporting female entrepreneurs, thought leaders and activists to address social exclusion of women and marginalised groups.","uk, portfolio, development, investment, the, climate, finance, himalaya, minister, kush, summit, new, funding, action, transformation, friendship, cent, inclusive, nepal, mitchell"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-amend-education-bill,EDITORIAL: Amend education bill,The Himalayan Times,2023-09-22 09:01:54,"Thousands of public school teachers took to the streets on Wednesday in Kathmandu in protest against some of the provisions in the School Education Bill that is registered in the House of Representatives, and their demands seem perfectly logical. Forwarding an 18-point demand, the irate teachers, who have gathered in the capital at the call of the Nepal Teachers' Federation, have called on the government to address their grievances first before tabling the bill in the Parliament for discussion. The agitation has brought the teaching-learning process in the community schools to a stop, where about five million students are enrolled in the 27,000 schools across the country. The agitation is likely to grow with each passing day as more teachers congregate in the capital in a show of force. Among the demands, the teachers are vehemently opposed to the local levels taking charge of the school management, teachers' appointment, transfer, demotion and dismissal. Community school teachers today are appointed only after passing the grueling exams and interviews of the Teachers Service Commission (TSC). Thus, their demand that any kind of decision regarding them should emanate from the federal government, just like that of the civil servants, sounds rational. Barring a few metropolitan cities like Kathmandu, most of the 753 local levels would not have the capacity to manage the schools. The way they are spending the local budget speaks volumes about their capacity, even after two local elections held after the new constitution was promulgated in 2015. Most of the local levels would not even have the human resource needed to appoint the teachers who are well qualified. There are other problems concerning the handing over of the school's management to the local government. For instance, how do you transfer a teacher from one rural municipality (Gaupalika) to another if need be? Will the other rural municipality that functions autonomously accept such a transfer? This means a teacher is stuck in one school until he retires and cannot even transfer himself to another school within a district, let alone to another province. Their whole career could be jeopardised as a result. Also, a local government is elected for a period of five years, and the new government could change, hire or appoint teachers, or the headmaster in particular, at will under one pretext or the other. How can you ensure quality in the community schools in a situation like this, not to mention the high chances of cadres of the political parties being appointed as teachers? Party leaders have expressed solidarity with the teachers' movement and called upon the government to fulfill the genuine demands of the teachers. However, meeting the teachers' demand to decouple school education from the jurisdiction of the local government will require amending the constitution as it has provisioned that basic and secondary education shall remain the sole jurisdiction of the local government. While there is solidarity with the teachers on certain issues, it is best they discard unreasonable demands, such as making the part-time teachers permanent through internal evaluation. Keep your vehicle fit Mechanically-unfit vehicles - two or four wheelers - are the main cause of traffic accidents in the urban centres, major highways and rural parts of the country. Proper maintenance of a vehicle is the foremost requirement to stay safe from any kind of road accident, which is very high in Nepal. The traffic police who are mostly concentrated in the city areas also do not conduct regular inspection of private or public vehicles plying the streets. They mostly focus on whether a driver carries a valid driving licence, bill book or if s/he is driving under the influence of alcohol. In order to minimise road accidents, the traffic police conducted a surprise check in the Kirtipur area recently, where nine out of 80 vehicles were found mechanically-unfit for plying the streets. A technical team from the Department of Transport Management inspected the tyres, brakes, steering wheel, engine and windshield wipers, among others.

Yesterday, government teachers ended their two-day long protest after they reached a seven-point agreement with the government. However, relief teachers whowere the major part of the teachers' protest had come out of the meeting after knowing that their demands would not be fulfilled. Issuing a notice, President of Relief Teachers' Federation Khemraj Adhikari and general secretary Kumar Bajagain deemed the agreement an act of betrayal and called to continue with the protest. There are around 40,000 relief teachers in the country who are either selected by a particular school management committee or by the local levels to fulfil teachers' requirements in government schools. Government teachers are to be selected by the Teachers Service Commission under the federal government. But due to lack of timely examinations, many public schools fail to fill vacant positions. Such relief teachers have demanded that separate examination be held to turn them into fulltime government teachers. This was a part of the 18-point demand forwarded by the NTF during the twoday protest. But, the NTF succumbed to the pressure of the government and agreed to end the protest without fulfilling the demands of relief teachers. The relief teachers' representatives departed from Singha Durbar where agreement was being reached without signing, citing that it was an act of betrayal. Today, a few hundred relief teachers obstructed traffic movement in Maitighar and staged demonstration for a few hours at the call of Nepal Relief Teachers' Central Committee. They have said that the protest will continue in the coming days as well if their demands are not addressed.

Today, the NTF members held meeting with Education Minister Ashok Rai and Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha. Butthe teachers' representative came out of the meeting. They have said that they will not sit for discussion until the Bill is withdrawn from the HoR. Teachers have majorly demanded that the provisions allowing the local government to take charge of school management, teachers' appointment, school principal's appointment, teachers' transfer, demotion and dismissal be amended. They have demanded that all these roles be handled by the federal government like issues of civil servants. Although the government had previously agreed to these demands, the Bill registered at the HoR does not include them. Teachers have accused the government of cheating them in this regard and deliberately bringing these provisions.

The clash erupted after agitating teachers broke through security barricades and attempted to enter the restricted area at New Baneshwor, the site of the federal parliament building. Thousands of school teachers, who had gathered from across the country to stage demonstrations in Kathmandu, became increasingly irate and breached security demarcations. As a result, five police personnel, one journalist, and 20 teachers sustained injuries. The information regarding the number of injuries was provided by Superintendent of Police Apil Raj Bohara, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Police Range. The injured are receiving treatment at various hospitals across Kathmandu Valley. To control the situation, security forces were compelled to deploy water cannons against the agitated protesters. A reporter from Prime Television, Sabina Karki, sustained a serious injury to her right eye after being struck by a blast from a water cannon used by security personnel to disperse the crowd. Despite repeated assurances from the government that their demands would be addressed, school teachers have continued their protest for over three weeks, calling for the immediate formulation of a new School Education Act. Even after Nepal's transition to a federal system with three tiers of government and two rounds of national elections, school education is still governed by outdated legislation dating back to the party-less Panchayat era. Teachers' unions and associations argue that the government has failed to honor three previous agreements signed with them. During a recent parliament meeting, lawmakers also voiced strong support for the immediate fulfillment of the teachers' legitimate demands.","teachers, school, apil, police, bohara, education, security, personnel, protest, the, demands, demarcations, cannon, sabina, cannons, fulfillment, barricades, assurances, journalist, unions"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/proportional-representation-and-the-issue-of-threshold,Proportional representation: And the issue of threshold,Birendra P Mishra,2025-01-27 10:56:11,"The concept of proportional representation (PR) was crystallised when the mixed parallel electoral system with 60 per cent seats for PR and 40 per cent seats for First Past-the Post (FPtP) segments was enshrined in the Interim Constitution for holding the Constitutional Assembly (CA) election, as there had been no provision of thresholds in our experiments with the FPtP in the 1959, 1991, 1994 and 1996 general elections. As a result, 25 parties out of 54 which contested the election acquired their shares. However, their number increased in the second CA by 30 against 122 parties that contested the election. However, the changed political representations in the second CA, which adopted the constitution in 2015, imposed a 3 per cent threshold for the House of Representatives (HoR) and 1.5 per cent for Provincial Assemblies. This provision resulted in the reduction of parties entitled for PR seats in the first HoR to five in the 2017 general election, which, however, increased to seven in the 2022 election. The provision of thresholds is an integral part of any electoral system, as every election process provides representation for which the minimum level of support by way of votes cast for a party or a candidate is needed. Even a plurality/majority system requires a threshold of representation to complete the process of getting representation. For example, in the plurality system (FPtP), maxim votes are required to acquire representation in the election. In a majoritarian system, majority votes are required to achieve representation. Thresholds are of two kinds: formal and natural. The first can also be called legal or formal, as these can be imposed by legislation, whereas the second can be called effective or natural, as these are based on a mathematical property of the electoral system. Thresholds vary from 0.67 per cent to 10 per cent, according to countries. Thresholds are important for a PR system, as parties that fail to secure less than the threshold number of votes are ineligible for seats from the PR lists. Though thresholds limit the electoral representation of extremist groups and very small parties, it leads to a waste of precious votes which voters cast. Keeping the problem of vote wastage, some countries have developed a system which permits getting a PR share if a party gets one or two of its candidates elected under the FPtP segment. It seems that these countries value the significance of representation. Democracy, a system of governance by duly elected representatives, makes representation its cornerstone of democracy, which is achieved through an electoral system. It seems the protagonists of raising the threshold percentage have not critically studied the effectiveness of threshold in a closed list PR system. They seem to overlook the ratio of PR and FPtP segments, which counts much. Had we adopted the electoral system of full PR system for all 275 seats of the HoR, it could have been comparatively more effective. The ratios of these two segments in the mixed parallel electoral system practised in nine countries vary from PR 29 per cent to 71 per cent FPtP seats in Albania to PR 54 per cent to 46 per cent FPtP in Hungary. However, after doing away with the ratio of 60-40 per cent adopted for the CA elections, we now have 40 per cent seats under the PR, reducing the importance of this segment and have enhanced the FPtP ratio to 60 per cent to make it prominent, as it is easier to win the election under it. Data show that parties got less votes in the PR category than in the FPtP. In the first CA election, the NC garnered 22.69 lakh PR votes and 23.48 lakh FPtP votes. The UML got 21.83 PR votes and 22.29 lakh FPtP votes. The Maoists got 31.44 lakh PR votes and 31.45 lakh FPtP votes. The trend was repeated in the second CA election, too. The trend continued in the first HoR election of 2017. It happens so because under the FPtP, an individual candidate exerts maximum efforts to get maximum votes by any means, whereas hardly any individual efforts are found in a closed PR list system. It is because in the PR segment the final nominations of candidates are uncertain. In the closed list PR, priority can be altered to suit the entitlements of candidates under different clusters. The process has become more complex as there are different clusters in this segment. Significantly, this segment has become a compensatory segment for the representation of women to make up for the shortfall of their representations in the FPtP segment. The role of independent candidates has to be considered, which limit the victory of political parties. Furthermore, there are parties whose popular leaders win an election under the FPtP segment with no entitlement for PR seats as in the case of the Unified Socialist party in the 2022 election. Without sufficient studies, our leaders believe that political instability can be overcome only by limiting the presence of parties in the HoR by reducing the number of fringe parties, which are entitled for their proportional shares of representation. They do not introspect that the instability lies in their leaders' insatiable lust for power, especially for the Prime Minister's post. History shows that from the 1990 people's movement to the 2006 movement, instability was invited by the top leaders to acquire state power. Nepal is a plural society with 142 castes and communities. It has 125 mother tongues and 10 religions. Our participatory democracy should not limit the number of parties, as they represent different shades of opinion that makes our representation real. If threshold is enhanced it will lead to a waste of valid votes considerably that will limit representation in the HoR.

The economic growth rate has contracted due to the landslide and flooding occurred in September 27-29 and the negative growth in the construction sector. The NSO said the government has set the target of 6 per cent economic growth rate in the current fiscal year and only 3.4 per cent GDP growth rate has been achieved in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. The growth rate of 17 out of the 18 various sectors contributing to the economy is in the positive while that of the construction sector is in the negative. Among them, electricity and gas-related activities have the highest growth rate of 21.4 per cent, while the transportation and storage sector is the second fastest-growing industrial sector with a growth rate of 6.7 per cent. Similarly, the value addition of accommodation and food service activities sector is estimated to grow by 6.3 per cent. According to the preliminary estimate, the growth rate of financial and insurance sector will be 5.7 per cent, the growth rate of administrative support service sector will be 5.4 per cent and the growth rate of professional scientific and technical services will be 5.1 per cent in the current fiscal year. It is estimated that the construction sector is shrinking slightly due to the decline in import of construction goods in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. The construction sector is negative by 0.3 per cent. The value added growth rate of agriculture, forests and fishery sector, which share the largest space in country's economy, is estimated to be three per cent. There is positive impact on total value addition of this sector following increase in production of summer crops including paddy as well as vegetables, cash crops and poultry products, it is said. Though agro products was expected to be increased following availability of chemical fertilizer, improved seed and sufficient monsoon rain, total value added growth rate of the agro sector could not increase sufficiently due to landslide and flood. The wholesale and retail trade sector is estimated to grow by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter. According to the office, it is expected to increase the value added growth rate of industrial goods production sector by 2.3 per cent, education sector by 0.4 per cent, health sector by 4.1 per cent and real estate sector by 3.1 per cent during the review period. Country's overall economy is towards positive growth due to increase in agro-production, power production and distribution, flow of tourists, reads the report.","cent, per, sector, growth, rate, the, value, agro, production, construction, economy, statistics, office, goods, products, fishery, fertilizer, nso, poultry, accommodation"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/rethinking-outcomes-lessons-from-my-seven-year-old-niece,Rethinking outcomes: Lessons from my seven-year-old niece,Shraddha Upadhyaya,2024-12-27 10:09:18,"A few months ago, the children of our families received a gift during a family gathering. Most of the children, being children, eagerly unwrapped their gifts, and we could see their faces lighting up with joy. But amidst it, my niece, a young girl who was hardly seven years old, did something that left me thinking. She ran up to her great grandfather who had bought all the gifts for these children, hugged him tightly, and thanked him - without even glancing at her gift. That moment hit me hard. Here was a child who, instead of fixating on the outcome (the gift), acknowledged the effort behind it. Her actions said, ""I value your thoughtfulness, not just the result."" How, I wondered, could someone so young grasp this nuance when so many of us spend our lives chasing outcomes, oblivious to the effort behind them? Thinking about this simple act of hers made me reflect on the ways I have been brought up, and it made me realise that we ""Nepalis"" live in a culture that glorifies results. From an early age, children are conditioned to prioritise grades over learning, medals over practice and awards over effort. I remember the Dashain festivals of my childhood, a time we eagerly waited for the family gathering where we could meet all our cousins and play, the time meant for joy and fun. Yet, there was always an undercurrent of dread. One of my uncles would inevitably ask about our grades, reminding us that there was only a ""1 per cent margin for error"" and that anything less than 99 per cent was unacceptable. His words lingered long after the tika ceremonies. This fixation caused anxiety over the festivities, leaving me scared, desperate, and I would question my worth, my value. I often imagine how different things might have been if, instead of asking about our grades and comparing them, he had asked, ""Did you try your best?"". When I reflect on that time, I can't help but wonder how things might have been different if he had encouraged us to focus on our efforts rather than our outcomes. This outcome-centric mindset isn't confined to childhood. It infiltrates and follows is into adulthood and in our workplaces too, where managers often reward outcomes without considering the effort behind them. Yet outcomes, as any economist or psychologist will tell you, are rarely entirely within our control. External factors, for instance market fluctuations, personal circumstances, even sheer luck - play a role. But if we simply focus on the effort, we recognise what is within our control and nurture resilience, learning and growth. This obsession with results seeps into every corner of our lives, shaping how we view success, relationships and even ourselves. It creates individuals who undervalue effort, leading to a lack of appreciation and gratitude. Our education system and culture, steeped in this obsession, produce individuals who struggle to value effort. And the impact is not just on their academic or professional growth but also on their relationships and personal lives. Social media is flooded with images of certificates, but how often do we see people sharing moments of engagement, questioning or discovery? This misplaced focus creates a void – a constant need for the next milestone, leaving little room to savour the journey. In personal relationships, this mindset can breed ungratefulness. When we value gifts over thoughtfulness, price tags and brands over efforts, it leads to a cycle of dissatisfaction, where we fail to recognise or reciprocate the efforts of those around us. Gratitude, a simple yet transformative emotion, often gets lost in the din. The only emotion which has immense potential to change how we see the world and directly impact the quality of our lives is lost. If we could with the same enthusiasm see the efforts, how happy and meaningful our lives would be. Coming back to my niece's simple but powerful lesson, what struck me about that seven-year-old's gesture was its simplicity. And how little it takes. In her hug, she expressed an overlooked and often undervalued concept: effort matters. A concept so basic that a child her age can grasp, yet so elusive that many adults struggle to embody. The concept is backed by many studies. Psychologists like Carol Dweck have written the power of effort through concepts like the ""growth mindset"", which encourages us to value persistence and hard work over innate talent or outcomes. Similarly, studies in behavioural science show that acknowledging effort in us and others build deeper satisfaction and stronger relationships. Perhaps, it's time to rethink how we measure success in schools, workplaces and life. Isn't it time we redefined how we measure success? What if schools emphasised effort and curiosity over test scores? What if workplaces celebrated persistence and innovation, not just results? And what if, in our personal lives, we began to notice and appreciate the small, everyday efforts of those around us? Reflecting on my niece's hug, I often wonder: How might our lives change if we shift our focus from outcomes to efforts? How many strained relationships could be healed, how many opportunities reclaimed, and how much joy rediscovered if we embraced this simple lesson? Perhaps, it's time to stop waiting for the perfect outcome and start celebrating the imperfect but earnest journey. And for my niece, here's my note of gratitude: To my dear niece, Saara Joshi: Thank you for showing me, through your simple and sincere gesture, what it means to value effort over outcomes. Your hug that day taught me lessons on how to live life. You reminded me that some of life's greatest insights come not from books or lectures, but from watching how it's practised, often by the youngest among us.","niece, my, our, relationships, hug, simple, the, gift, mindset, outcome, concept, how, emotion, lesson, gesture, obsession, this, gifts, personal, her"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/the-power-of-hope-it-holds-the-mirror-to-our-future,The power of hope: It holds the mirror to our future,Rajgopal Nidamboor,2024-11-21 09:56:06,"Hope insulates us against stress. It inspires us to overcome difficulties. It reduces the song of one's burden - the excess baggage of surplus, negative emotions that we carry during tough times. It is not just that - when the going gets tough, the tough 'get going.' Everyone does that - in one way, or the other - the analogy being of foresight, not courage. Hope stretches beyond the present circumstance. It holds the mirror to the future. It enables us to perceive the impending with animated optimism, even when one does not expect things to be perfect. Nothing is perfect - what one hopes for, in the midst of chaos, is optimism for things to slowly, but steadily work for us. Hope is not only a physical, emotional and functional sense of the future; it also embodies, in more ways than one, a purpose. It holds enormous meaning for us to believe in our dreams, vision, goals and also oneself. It involves a state of perseverance, in the wake of setbacks. In a purely logical sense, hope is the modification of our innumerable thought processes. It holds the power to self-belief, self-motivation and self-direction. It not only prods us to weather life's countless storms; it also spurs us to keep at it and keep things going. Hope may not work sometimes, more so when we throw in the towel easily. It may, of course, emerge 'out of the blue' - at the drop of a positive spark ignited in the 'distance.' All of us have our favourite parallel for hope. For some, the first form of hope emanates on a daily basis. There is hope in the air. This offers us a sense of intention to achieve our daily goals. It also urges us to wake up at first light, each day, and live life with simple daily pleasures, not riches. For some, hope is a goal-oriented pursuit - to meeting objectives, clearing hurdles with flair and drive, or climbing several notches on the career ladder. It is overcoming challenges. It is regular work too that needs to be finished to take home rewards in close proximity to the future. This may encompass instant, or deferred satisfaction - where a good thing emerges like raindrops falling on the head, or where one has to wait for the right time, or right moment, to arrive, as it were. For some of us, there is yet another form - long-term hope. This is life nourishing. It sustains and helps us to understand that, notwithstanding troubles, or health and wealth issues, life will always offer us significance and purpose at every step of our journey. Long-term hope relates and connects itself to our mindful soul. It arms us with a vibrant feeling that instils in us the wholesome power to effect, or bring about change over a period of time. It takes a long time for a coconut tree to grow and bear fruit. In like manner, long-term hope gives us the resolve to work hard and achieve goals - one thing at a time. Hope is not limited only to hopeful expectations for the better. There is also a downside to its overall chemistry. This is called false hope - two sides of the same denomination. This is also reason why some of us cling to hope as something that will happen - or, use it as an instrument of denial. Interestingly though, a strange quirk may seize a sudden hopeful element in our mind. This leads to a turnaround. You know its name - extraordinary hope, followed by powerful hope. It inspires us all to surmount every abyss, or gloom. The inference is obvious. We just need to move ahead and discover ourselves. Else, we will only continue to stay where we are. It's only when we travel through a given, or not given, situation gracefully, without displaying any protracted silhouette of bitterness, ill-feeling, or acrimony, can we grow, shine and paint a picture of our true selves - a portrait that radiates. We have such people around us - they emote a happy, contended feeling. They are people who are just as human as we are - fallible. They have their moments of annoyance and umbrage too. Yet, they have overcome, or risen above situations, or circumstances. They have stopped wallowing in self-pity. They have moved on to another plane, with conscious effort. They have accepted the fact that everything is fleeting, also impermanent. They have resolved to be what they are. In so doing, they have emerged without being stuck in the swamp. They are like birds - they prefer to fly with liberty. You'd call them the 'risen up' people who transcend and echo blessings. They have managed to consciously grow up. Life for them is, indeed, the best thing that's ever happened. They are victors; not victims. They have learned and developed the ability to go forward with each situation with good hope. They have worked on their rough edges - large and small. They are like polished granite, or emblematic gemstone, that has become silky-smooth and alluring to 'stroke' with their own hands. Research avers that we all use only a small part of our inherent talents. In other words, we barely tap our true potential in a life-time. Imagine this - if only we were to employ all of our inner resources, we would not only astound ourselves, we would probably outdo the element of what it means to be just human, a mere mortal 'being.' Yet, how strange things are - even when we know. We'd, therefore, make everything that seems impossible possible. This is our 'companion' that helps us beat, reduce, or surmount problems. They relate to our spirit of enterprise grounded in inner peace and inner achievement. The best part is - we are all endowed with such internal resources. It's up to us to say, 'carpe diem,' and move anything stalling our minds.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/us-election-the-final-day-of-voting-in-the-us-is-here-after-tens-of-millions-have-already-cast-their-ballots,"US Election: The final day of voting in the US is here, after tens of millions have already cast their ballots",Associated Press,2024-11-05 11:05:40,"WASHINGTON, NOVEMBER 5 Election Day 2024 arrived Tuesday - with tens of millions of Americans having already cast their ballots. Those include record numbers in Georgia, North Carolina and other battleground states that could decide the winner. The early turnout in Georgia, which has flipped between the Republican and Democratic nominees in the previous two presidential elections, has been so robust - over 4 million voters - that a top official in the secretary of state's office said the big day could look like a ""ghost town"" at the polls. As of Monday, Associated Press tracking of advance voting nationwide showed roughly 82 million ballots already cast - slightly more than half the total number of votes in the presidential election four years earlier. That's driven partly by Republican voters, who were casting early ballots at a higher rate than in recent previous elections after a campaign by former President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee to counter the Democrats' longstanding advantage in the early vote. Despite long lines in some places and a few hiccups that are common to all elections, early in-person and mail voting proceeded without any major problems. That included in the parts of western North Carolina hammered last month by Hurricane Helene. State and local election officials, benefiting from changes made by the Republican-controlled legislature, pulled off a herculean effort to ensure residents could cast their ballots as they dealt with power outages, lack of water and washed out roads. By the time early voting in North Carolina had ended on Saturday, over 4.4 million voters - or nearly 57% of all registered voters in the state - had cast their ballots. As of Monday, turnout in the 25 western counties affected by the hurricane was even stronger at 59% of registered voters, state election board Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell said. Brinson Bell called the voters and election workers in the hurricane-hit counties ""an inspiration to us all."" Besides the hurricanes in North Carolina and Florida, the most worrisome disruptions to the election season so far were arson attacks that damaged ballots in two drop boxes near the Oregon-Washington border. Authorities there were searching for the person responsible. The absence of any significant, widespread problems has not stopped Trump, the Republican nominee, or the RNC, which is now under his sway, from making numerous claims of fraud or election interference during the early voting period, a possible prelude to challenges after Election Day. He has mischaracterized an investigation underway in Pennsylvania into roughly 2,500 potentially fraudulent voter registration applications by saying one of the counties was ""caught with 2600 Fake Ballots and Forms, all written by the same person."" The investigation is into registration applications; there is no indication that ballots are involved. In Georgia, Republicans sought to prohibit voters from returning mailed ballots to their local election office by the close of polls on Election Day, votes that are allowed under state law. A judge rejected their lawsuit over the weekend. Trump and Republicans also have warned about the possibility that Democrats are recruiting masses of noncitizens to vote, a claim they have made without evidence and that runs counter to the data, including from Republican secretaries of state. Research has consistently shown that noncitizens registering to vote is rare. Any noncitizen who does faces the potential of felony charges and deportation, a significant disincentive. One case of noncitizen voting was caught during early voting last month and resulted in felony charges in Michigan after a student from China cast an illegal early ballot. This is the first presidential vote since Trump lost to Joe Biden four years ago and began various attempts to circumvent the outcome and remain in power. That climaxed with the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol to halt certification of the results after Trump told his supporters to ""fight like hell."" Even now, a solid majority of Republicans believe Trump's lie that Biden was not legitimately elected, despite reviews, audits and recounts in the battleground states that all affirmed Biden's win. A survey last month from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed Republicans remain much more skeptical than Democrats that their ballots will be counted accurately this year. Seeking to rebuild voter confidence in a system targeted with false claims of widespread fraud, Republican lawmakers in more than a dozen states since 2020 have passed new voting restrictions. Those rules include shortening the window to apply or return a mail ballot, reducing the availability of ballot drop boxes and adding ID requirements. On the last weekend before Election Day, Trump continued to falsely claim the election was being rigged against him and said a presidential winner should be declared on election night, before all the ballots are counted. Vice President Kamala Harris urged voters not to fall for Trump's tactic of casting doubt on elections. The Democratic nominee told supporters at a weekend rally in Michigan that the tactic was intended to suggest to people ""that if they vote, their vote won't matter."" Instead, she urged people who had already cast ballots to encourage their friends to do the same. Through four years of election lies and voting-related conspiracy theories, local election officials have faced harassment and even death threats. That has prompted high turnover and led to heightened security for election offices and polling sites that includes panic buttons and bullet-proof glass. While there have been no major reports of any malicious cyberactivity affecting election offices, foreign actors have been active in using fake social media profiles and websites to drum up partisan vitriol and disinformation. In the final weeks, U.S. intelligence officials have attributed to Russia multiple fake videos alleging election fraud in presidential swing states. On the eve of Election Day, they issued a joint statement with federal law enforcement agencies warning that Russia in particular was ramping up its influence operations, including in ways that could incite violence, and likely would continue those efforts well after the votes have been cast. Jen Easterly, the nation's top election security official, urged Americans to rely on state and local election officials for information about elections. ""This is especially important as we are in an election cycle with an unprecedented amount of disinformation, including disinformation being aggressively peddled and amplified by our foreign adversaries at a greater scale than ever before,"" she said. ""We cannot allow our foreign adversaries to have a vote in our democracy.""","election, the, ballots, republican, voters, voting, hurricane, brinson, ballot, vote, counties, presidential, bell, state, associated, roughly, fake, early, trump, noncitizen"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/the-us-is-giving-ukraine-billions-more-in-weapons-heres-how-they-will-help,The US is giving Ukraine billions more in weapons. Here's how they will help,Associated Press,2024-09-28 15:37:14,"WASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER 28 The Biden administration's latest infusion of more than $2.7 billion in military aid for Ukraine and the promise of billions more will give Kyiv a massive boost in air defenses, but much of the aid is in long-range contracts for weapons that won't be seen on the battlefield for some time. Included in a $2.4 billion long-term assistance package announced Thursday - just before meetings between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris - is another Patriot missile battery and additional munitions for the system. Patriots are critical air defense systems that the U.S. military uses around the world to protect American forces and allies. It is a high-demand air defense capability, and the U.S. has a limited number of them and the missiles they fire. The system is being provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which funds longer-term contracts. An additional $375 million package of more immediate aid also was announced this week, including an undisclosed number of glide bombs equipped with cluster munitions, as well as a wide array of rockets, missiles and artillery. Those weapons are coming through presidential drawdown authority, which allows the Pentagon quickly to pull supplies from its shelves to speed them to Ukraine's front line. All said, the latest support raises the total amount of weapons and security assistance the U.S. has provided Ukraine to almost $60 billion since Russia invaded in February 2022. For comparison, the U.S. spent $60.6 billion from 2003 through 2012 to fund Iraq's security forces and civilian reconstruction, according to the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Of that total, $20 billion went to funding, equipping, providing uniforms for and training Iraq's security forces. Here's a look at the latest military aid going to Ukraine: More immediate weapons For the first time, the U.S. will send Ukraine the Joint Standoff Weapon - a glide bomb known as JSOW - ""to enhance Ukraine's long-range capabilities."" The variant being sent includes cluster munitions, according to U.S. officials. The U.S. Navy's JSOW is a precision strike air-to-surface weapon with a range of 12 to 63 nautical miles that can be fired by F-16 fighter jets and other aircraft. The decision to send the JSOW does not, however, answer Zelenskyy's push for more long-range weapons, such as the Army's long-range ballistic missiles called ATACMS, or the authority he seeks to use them to strike deep into Russia. Use of the JSOW also depends on the ability of Ukraine's forces to fly their fighter jets closer to the border, including to do strikes that could reach farther into Russia. But Russia also has substantial air defense systems. The package also includes ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds, Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems, armored vehicles, bridging systems, patrol boats and other equipment. Longer-term support The vast majority of the aid is funding to get longer-term contracts underway that will keep weapons flowing in the months and years to come. The package includes money to obtain additional air defenses, unmanned aerial systems and air-to-ground munitions. The Defense Department also will get drone components to send to Ukraine to support its own growing capabilities to assemble and manufacture its own systems. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the support would help Ukraine produce an additional 10,000 drones over the next six months. The package also includes the tools and components needed to support Ukraine's own munitions production and spare parts, the Defense Department said. After Thursday's announcement, the U.S. has about $1.67 billion in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds remaining to support longer-term contracts for Ukraine, a sum that Biden pledged he would spend before leaving office in January. Beyond the additional Patriot battery, Biden said he's also directed the Pentagon to expand its training program to get more Ukrainian pilots flying F-16 fighter jets and is funding training for an additional 18 pilots next year. Some of the student pilots - the most advanced, who had previous fighter jet experience - have flowed through a National Guard base in Arizona after getting English-language training. That's needed because all of the interfaces on the F-16 are in English. The first class of those pilots graduated from the course and returned to Ukraine earlier this year. Late last month, an F-16 that Ukraine received from its Western partners crashed during a Russian bombardment and killed the pilot. Other Ukrainian aviators who only have basic flying skills have started under programs with partner nations to build up their experience.","the, systems, additional, ukraine, pilots, defense, reconstruction, munitions, assistance, range, billion, security, air, iraq, artillery, aid, fighter, package, patriot, jsow"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/us-wants-more-clarity-from-ukraine-on-possible-use-of-long-range-weapons,US wants more clarity from Ukraine on possible use of long-range weapons,Associated Press,2024-09-19 22:22:07,"WASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER 19 The Biden administration still is not convinced that it should give Ukraine the authority to launch long-range missiles deeper into Russia, and U.S. officials say they are seeking more detailed information about how Kyiv would use the weapons and how they fit into the broader strategy for the war. U.S. officials said they have asked Ukraine to spell out more clearly its combat objectives, as President Joe Biden prepares to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy next week. Administration officials are concerned that loosening restrictions on the use of the weapons would have limited impact and come with great risk. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week warned that Russia would be ""at war"" with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. U.S. defense officials have repeatedly argued that the long-range missiles are limited in number and that Ukraine already is using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. That capability was evidenced by a Ukrainian drone strike overnight that hit a large military depot, causing a huge blaze, in a town 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border. Ukrainian leaders, however, say they need permission to strike weapons depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. The U.S. allows Ukraine to use American-provided weapons in more limited, cross-border strikes to counter attacks by Russian forces. The U.S. is coming under mounting pressure from NATO allies who believe Ukraine should be the one to decide how and where it uses the weapons and how it fights its own war. A senior U.S. official said the subject came up during meetings of NATO defense chiefs in Europe over the weekend - attended by Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff - and that most advocated in favor of the change. The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Ukraine is pressing to use U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, and British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to hit deeper into Russia. Biden discussed the issue during a meeting last week with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. U.S. officials familiar with discussions said they believed Starmer was seeking Biden's approval to allow Ukraine to use the Storm Shadow missiles for expanded strikes in Russia. Biden's approval may be needed because Storm Shadow components are made in the U.S. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to share the status of private conversations. Starmer said talks would continue when global leaders convene for the U.N. General Assembly gathering next week. Biden's meeting with Zelenskyy is expected to happen late next week after the U.S. president returns from the U.N. A senior U.S. official said the U.S. wants to help Ukraine shape its combat objectives for the war and the use of long-range weapons. On Saturday, the head of NATO's military committee said Ukraine has the solid legal and military right to strike deep inside Russia to gain combat advantage. Speaking in Prague at the close of the meeting of the alliance's military chiefs, Adm. Rob Bauer of the Netherlands said, ""Every nation that is attacked has the right to defend itself. And that right doesn't stop at the border of your own nation."" Lt. Gen. Karel Řehka, chief of the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces, made it clear his nation places no such weapons restrictions on Kyiv. ""We believe that the Ukrainians should decide themselves how to use it,"" Řehka said. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, however, has consistently pushed back on the idea that long-range strikes would be a game-changer. ""I don't believe one capability is going to be decisive, and I stand by that comment,"" Austin said, noting that Ukraine has other means to strike long-range targets.","the, weapons, range, shadow, storm, chiefs, nato, biden, long, missiles, karel, řehka, forces, bauer, defense, officials, military, rob, ukrainian, brown"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/ukraine-renews-calls-on-the-west-to-approve-long-range-strikes-on-russian-territory,Ukraine renews calls on the West to approve long-range strikes on Russian territory,Associated Press,2024-09-15 22:50:54,"KYIV, SEPTEMBER 15 Ukraine made a new call Saturday on the West to allow it to strike deeper into Russia after a meeting between U.S. and British leaders a day earlier produced no visible shift in their policy on the use of long-range weapons. The renewed appeal came as Kyiv said Russia launched more drone and artillery attacks into Ukraine overnight. ""Russian terror begins at weapons depots, airfields and military bases inside the Russian Federation,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak said Saturday. ""Permission to strike deep into Russia will speed up the solution."" Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called on allies to greenlight the use of Western-provided long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. So far, the U.S. has allowed Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia's border with Ukraine. Discussions on allowing long-range strikes were believed to be on the table when U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met in Washington on Friday but no decision was announced immediately. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pressing the U.S. and other allies to allow his forces to use Western weapons to target air bases and launch sites farther afield as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine's electricity grid and utilities before winter. He did not directly comment on the meeting Saturday morning, but said that more than 70 Russian drones had been launched into Ukraine overnight. The Ukrainian air force later said that 76 Russian drones had been sighted, of which 72 were shot down. ""We need to boost our air defense and long-range capabilities to protect our people,"" Zelenskyy wrote on social media. ""We are working on this with all of Ukraine's partners."" Other overnight attacks saw one person killed by Russian artillery fire as energy infrastructure was targeted in Ukraine's Sumy region. A 54-year-old driver was killed and seven more people were hospitalized, Ukraine's Ministry of Energy said. Another three people died Saturday in a Russian strike on an agricultural enterprise in the front-line town of Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region, Gov. Ivan Fedorov said. Moscow warns Western nations Meanwhile, officials in Moscow have continued to make public statements warning that long-range strikes would provoke further escalation between Russia and the West. The remarks are in line with the narrative the Kremlin has promoted since early in the war, accusing NATO countries of de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told state news agency Tass on Saturday that the U.S. and British governments were pushing the conflict, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, toward ""poorly controlled escalation."" Biden on Friday brushed off similar comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said on Thursday that allowing long-range strikes ""would mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries, are at war with Russia."" Asked what he thought about Putin's threat, Biden answered, ""I don't think much about Vladimir Putin."" POWs exchanged Russian and Ukrainian officials also announced on Saturday a prisoner swap brokered by the United Arab Emirates. It included 206 prisoners on both sides, including Russians captured in Ukraine's incursion in the Kursk region. The swap is the eighth of its kind since the beginning of 2024, and puts the total number of POWs exchanged at 1,994. Previous exchanges were also brokered by the UAE. Both sides released images of soldiers traveling to meet friends and family, with Zelenskyy commenting, ""Our people are home."" Elsewhere, Russia's Defense Ministry said that 19 Ukrainian drones had been shot down over the country's Kursk and Belgorod regions. A woman also died Saturday after a Ukrainian shell hit her home in the border village of Bezlyudovka, Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.","russian, ukrainian, weapons, ukraine, the, fedorov, ryabkov, range, yermak, andriy, swap, defense, drones, vyacheslav, gladkov, putin, sergei, belgorod, ivan, british"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/why-ukraine-wants-to-use-western-long-range-missiles-inside-russia,Why Ukraine wants to use Western long-range missiles inside Russia,Associated Press,2024-09-15 22:22:17,"KYIV, SEPTEMBER 15 Ukraine is pushing for permission from its Western partners to use the long-range missiles they have provided to strike targets deep inside Russia, as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv officials argue the weapons are vital to weaken Russia's ability to strike Ukraine and force it to move its strike capabilities further from the border. Russia has warned that it would consider allowing such long-range strikes an act of war, and Ukraine's Western allies are wary of antagonizing the country with the world's largest nuclear arsenal. The issue is likely to weigh heavily on White House meetings Friday between President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as well as with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later this month. WHAT ARE THESE WEAPONS? The long-range missiles include systems like the British-led Storm Shadow and the similar French-made SCALP or the U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System, ATACMS. Ukraine is ramping up its own domestic programs to develop long-range weapons, including drones already capable of hitting targets deep inside Russian territory. The Western missiles, however, would offer greater precision and a far bigger destructive capacity. The air-launched Storm Shadow and the ground-launched ATACMS are already being used by Ukraine to carry out pinpoint strikes on military installations and strategic infrastructure inside its Russian-occupied territories – but not on Russian soil. Germany has long refused to send its long-range TAURUS missiles, citing concerns over international escalation. HOW WOULD THEY HELP UKRAINE? Ukraine sees the ability to use long-range missiles behind enemy lines as a game-changer, allowing it to target air bases, supply depots, and communication centers hundreds of kilometers (miles) over the border. It argues that this would help reduce Russia's air superiority and weaken supply lines needed to launch daily airstrikes against Ukraine – with drones, missiles, and powerful glide bombs – and to sustain its military ground offensive into Ukraine. With winter likely to slow that advance, long-range air strike capabilities will become a higher priority. Kyiv wants to go back on the offensive to offset military manpower shortages 2½ years into the war and to protect its badly-damaged power infrastructure. Last week U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy and appeared cool to Kyiv's request, arguing that Ukraine has already been striking targets in Russia with domestically produced weapons. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz also noted the ATACMs wouldn't be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from long-range Russian-fired glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) away, beyond the ATACMS reach. WILL THE WEST RELENT? The United States and other NATO members – while backing Ukraine with weapons, training and financial aid – are trying to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia. The Kremlin says that a red line would be crossed if Western missiles are used on its territory, a warning reiterated by Russian President Vladimir Putin this week. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Minister David Lammy discussed the issue at length this week in London and during a joint trip to Kyiv. They remained publicly noncommittal on any change in missile policy, but noted that Russia is seeking to further shift the strategic balance in Ukraine by acquiring Iranian long-range ballistic missiles. For its part, Ukraine says it already has defied Russia's red lines with its five-week incursion into Russia's Kursk border region. Zelenskyy added that he hopes allies will make ""strong decisions"" when he meets with Biden later this month.","range, missiles, atacms, long, russian, weapons, missile, russia, kyiv, western, the, shadow, its, lines, storm, ukraine, dietz, lammy, air, charlie"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/top-us-and-uk-diplomats-visit-kyiv-as-ukraine-pleads-for-permission-to-strike-inside-russia,Top US and UK diplomats visit Kyiv as Ukraine pleads for permission to strike inside Russia,Associated Press,2024-09-11 22:06:53,"KYIV, SEPTEMBER 11 The top U.S. and British diplomats traveled together to the Ukrainian capital Wednesday to underscore their commitment to the country in its war with Russia, and Ukrainian officials pressured the visitors to let them use Western-provided long-range missiles against targets inside Russia. The rare joint visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy unfolded as Russia's bigger and better-equipped army bears down on Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region and pounds the country with missiles, glide bombs and drones that claim many civilian casualties. Lammy said the 2 1/2-year conflict is at a ""critical"" juncture following Ukraine's daring incursion last month into Russia's Kursk region, even as it tries to defend against its neighbor's aerial attacks on cities across the country. ""We convey the deepest condolences for the shocking attacks that we have seen, over the loss of civilian life, particularly women and children - horrific, barbaric, unbelievable,"" Lammy said. He noted that Britain is setting aside 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) a year to help Ukraine. But relations between Ukraine and its Western partners have been increasingly strained by Kyiv's repeated appeals for the West's authorization to use long-range weapons from the United States and other allies to strike targets deeper inside Russia. That issue has become more urgent given Russia's latest reported acquisition of ballistic missiles from Iran, but Western leaders have balked at the request, fearing that, if granted, it could escalate the war. U.S. President Joe Biden has allowed Ukraine to fire U.S.-provided missiles across the border into Russia in self-defense, but has largely limited the distance they can be fired. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he hoped for changes to those limitations. ""Let's count on some strong decisions, at least,"" he said. ""For us, it's very important."" He said he hoped to speak to Biden later this month, noting that U.S. military and financial support is crucial. ""We rely heavily on it, and frankly, we can't prevail without it,"" Zelenskyy said. However, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last week pushed back on the idea that long-range strikes would be a game-changer. ""I don't believe one capability is going to be decisive, and I stand by that comment,"" Austin said at a meeting of allied military leaders in Germany. The Ukrainians have other means to strike long-range targets, he added. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told Lammy he hoped an agreement on using long-range assets ""for strikes on the territory of our enemy"" could be reached. ""We hope for your help and support in this issue."" Shmyhal described the meeting with Lammy in Kyiv as ""intense"" but gave no other details in his post on his Telegram channel. A hard winter likely lies ahead for Ukraine. Its power grid is under severe strain after Russian missiles and drones knocked out around 70% of the country's generation capacity. Kyiv officials will also have to navigate the outcome of the U.S. election in November, which could produce important policy shifts in Washington. Former President Donald Trump said in a presidential debate Tuesday that he wants the war to end but did not clearly say he wants Ukraine to win. The top U.S. and British diplomats reached the Ukrainian capital by train from Poland. Blinken traveled from London, where he accused Iran of providing Russia with Fath-360 short-range ballistic missiles, calling the move a ""dramatic escalation"" of the war. Referring to those missiles, Shmyhal added: ""Russia's use of weapons from its terrorist allies to strike at Ukraine continues their genocidal war and terrorism on our territory. We must be able to respond to such terrorism in kind by destroying military targets on their territory to ensure greater safety for our citizens."" Wednesday's visit came ahead of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's planned trip to Washington, where he will meet Biden at the White House on Friday. Ukraine's request for permission to strike Russian targets is due to feature in the discussion. The visit was, unusually, announced in advance - a public signal of American and British support for Ukraine. As Blinken and Lammy arrived in Kyiv, the U.K. announced it would ban 10 commercial ships it accuses of illicitly transporting Russian oil in violation of international sanctions. The U.K. government said the vessels would be barred from British ports and could be detained if they enter.","range, missiles, the, british, russia, kyiv, ukrainian, targets, shmyhal, lammy, denys, territory, lloyd, russian, starmer, keir, ukraine, diplomats, austin, western"

Several series of explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Monday, sending residents into bomb shelters. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said emergency services were called to the Holosiivskyi and Solomianskyi districts of Kyiv. One person was reportedly injured by falling debris in Shevchenkivskyi district, Klitschko said. ""There will be an answer for everything. The enemy will feel it,"" the head of the Presidential Office, Andrii Yermak, posted on his Telegram page following the attack. According to the air force, Russia fired several groups of cruise missiles accompanied by ballistic missile launches and a few drones, targeting Kyiv. An explosion also rang out in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, according to Ukrainian media. The barrage comes a day after Russia's military reported intercepting and destroying 158 Ukrainian drones targeting multiple Russian regions in one of the biggest attacks of the war that has raged for about 2 1/2 years. Forty-six of the drones were over the Kursk region, where Ukraine has sent its forces in recent weeks in the largest incursion on Russian soil since World War II. A further 34 were shot over the Bryansk region, 28 over the Voronezh region, and 14 over the Belgorod region - all of which border Ukraine. Drones were also shot down deeper into Russia, including one each in the Tver region, northwest of Moscow, and the Ivanovo region, northeast of the Russian capital. Russia's Defense Ministry said drones were intercepted over 15 regions, while one other governor said a drone was shot down over his region, too. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that falling debris from one of the two drones shot down over the city caused a fire at an oil refinery. Ukrainian drone strikes have brought the fight far from the front line into the heart of Russia. Since the beginning of the year, Ukraine has stepped up aerial assaults on Russian soil, targeting refineries and oil terminals to slow down the Kremlin's assault. Also in Russia, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said 11 people were wounded in Ukrainian aerial missile attacks in the Russian border region of Belgorod on Sunday. These included eight in the regional capital, also called Belgorod. Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday it had taken control of the towns of Pivnichne and Vyimka, in Ukraine's Donetsk region. The Associated Press could not independently verify the claim. Russian forces have been driving deeper into the partly occupied eastern region, the total capture of which is one of the Kremlin's primary ambitions. Russia's army is closing in on Pokrovsk, a critical logistics hub for the Ukrainian defense in the area. At least three people were killed and nine wounded on Sunday in Russian shelling in the town of Kurakhove, some 20 miles (33 kilometers) south of Pokrovsk, Donetsk regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said. Also on Sunday, 44 people were wounded when Russia attacked the Kharkiv regional capital, also called Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. The city was struck by 10 missiles, with a shopping center, a sports facility and residential buildings among those damaged. Elsewhere in Ukraine overnight, eight drones were shot down out of 11 launched by Russia, according to the Ukrainian air force. One person was killed and four wounded in shelling overnight in the Sumy region, local officials said, while Kharkiv Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said five other people had been wounded in his region.","region, the, ukrainian, russian, drones, ukraine, gov, vitalii, filashkin, sobyanin, terekhov, syniehubov, ihor, vadym, klitschko, oleh, defense, missiles, mayor, vyacheslav"

Russian forces fired five missiles and 74 Shahed drones at Ukrainian targets, an air force statement said. Air defenses stopped two missiles and 60 drones, and 14 other drones presumably fell before reaching their target, it said. Authorities in the capital, Kyiv, said debris of destroyed drones fell in three districts of the city, causing minor damage to civilian infrastructure but no injuries. Russia's relentless and unnerving long-range strikes on civilian areas have been a feature of the war since it invaded its neighbor in February 2022. Ukrainian officials have recently become more vocal in their long-standing insistence that Western countries supporting their war effort should scrap restrictions on what Ukraine is allowed to target inside Russia with long-range weapons they have provided. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy renewed his pleas for Western allies to untie his hands in deciding what to strike on Russian soil. ""All our partners should be more active - much more active - in countering Russian terror,"" Zelenskyy said late Wednesday. ""We continue to insist that their determination now - lifting the restrictions on long-range strikes for Ukraine now - will help us to end the war as soon as possible in a fair way for Ukraine and the world as a whole."" The European Union's top diplomat on Thursday backed Zelenskyy's push for international backers to end their limits. Ukraine has deployed domestically produced drones to strike Russia. The Russian military said Thursday it had thwarted an overnight attack on Crimea. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces destroyed three Ukrainian sea drones aimed at the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The Russia-installed governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhayev added that four Ukrainian aerial drones and three sea drones were destroyed ""at a significant distance"" from the peninsula's shore. In the meantime, Ukraine's Army General Staff acknowledged Thursday Ukraine's involvement in strikes this week on oil depots deep inside Russia, where blazes broke out. The attacks in the Rostov and Kirov regions were part of Ukraine's effort to disrupt logistical infrastructure supporting Russia's war machine.","drones, sea, russian, ukraine, ukrainian, zelenskyy, air, peninsula, range, russia, the, war, volodymyr, missiles, razvozhayev, pleas, kirov, union, strikes, black"

And, no, he will not adjust how he plays to protect the knee. ""I don't see myself holding back. I don't see myself calculating or being a bit more cautious in the movement. I don't see that happening,"" Djokovic said at a pre-tournament news conference Saturday. ""Really, I go all in. I go full out. I mean, that's the way I've been playing my entire career."" When a reporter asked Djokovic why he would risk getting back on court at all so soon after the surgery, the player said his wife posed the very same question. Djokovic, who has yet to reach a final at any event in 2024, described what he called an ""incredible desire to play, just to compete"" and added that Wimbledon, in particular, has held a special place in his heart since he was a kid. So, Djokovic continued, merely ""the thought of me missing Wimbledon was just not correct; I didn't want to deal with that."" He explained that while he was ""very much in doubt of making"" it to the All England Club after getting hurt at the French Open on June 3, he is far more optimistic after a week of practices at the site of the grass-court major that begins Monday. ""All the days that I've spent here,"" he said, ""give me only positive signs and encourage me to really think - not just think, but feel - that I can do it."" His first-round match against qualifier Vit Kopriva is scheduled for Tuesday. ""I didn't come here to play a few rounds and prove to myself and others that I can actually compete in one or two matches. I really want to go for the title,"" said Djokovic, who is seeded No. 2 behind Jannik Sinner and was the runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz a year ago at Wimbledon. ""The last three days have given me enough optimism and good signs that I can actually be in a state to compete on the highest level for the next few weeks, hopefully."" The 37-year-old from Serbia was hurt during a five-set victory over Francisco Cerundulo in the fourth round at Roland Garros, withdrew before he was supposed to play in the quarterfinals and underwent an operation in Paris on June 5. After wearing a gray sleeve on his right leg while playing practice sets at the All England Club with players including Australian Open champion Sinner, 2021 U.S. Open winner Daniil Medvedev and Frances Tiafoe, Djokovic said there haven't been any setbacks and he is ""confident about the health of my knee."" Djokovic said he had ""extensive conversations"" with other athletes who have recovered from similar knee procedures, among them tennis players Taylor Fritz and Stan Wawrinka, and retired Olympic champion ski racer Lindsey Vonn. In 2021, Fritz injured his knee at the French Open and returned to competition at Wimbledon three weeks later. Alcaraz said he considered Djokovic superhuman for being able to come back so quickly. When that comment was relayed to Djokovic, he grinned. ""Well, not really. I think Taylor Fritz is a superhuman. He recovered in 21 days; I (had) a bit more (time),"" Djokovic said. ""It's not ideal, maybe, in the eyes of the doctors and specialists that would normally tell you it's normally between three and six weeks. The closer to six weeks the better, probably, because you want to not risk too much and give your knee and your body time,"" he said. ""But it's also individual. It's very subjective. Everyone has a different response to the recovery, to the injury, to rehab, to exercises.""","knee, weeks, the, wimbledon, djokovic, novak, open, vonn, kopriva, lindsey, vit, daniil, june, medvedev, signs, sinner, slam, racer, tiafoe, frances"

Playing his first match since tearing the meniscus in his knee at the French Open on June 3, Djokovic never faced a break point along the way to a 6-01, 6-2, 6-2 victory over qualifier Vit Kopriva in under two hours on Centre Court. The 37-year-old Djokovic has won seven of his men's-record 24 Grand Slam titles at the All England Club and was the runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz last year. Djokovic hurt his knee during a five-set win at Roland Garros and pulled out of that tournament, then had surgery in Paris on June 5.

Lajal proved to be something of a speedbump for Alcaraz, who acknowledged that his 269th-ranked Estonian opponent ""surprised me a little bit"" on Day 1 at the All England Club. Alcaraz, who won his third major championship at the French Open three weeks ago, defeated Novak Djokovic in last year's final on the grass at Wimbledon but said he was still nervous before Monday's match. ""When I walk into the court, I got goosebumps. I remembered last year. It was a great feeling,"" the 21-year-old Spaniard said in his on-court interview. ""But I try not to think about it. It's a new year - totally different tournament. I have to be focused on my game just to play at the same level as last year if I want to repeat the same (success) as last year."" Earlier, Aryna Sabalenka and Victoria Azarenka both pulled out of the tournament because of respective shoulder injuries. Sabalenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, said she was "" heartbroken "" to announce her withdrawal after it became clear in a practice session that she wasn't ready. The No. 3 seed was seen as top contender at the All England Club, which has had seven different women win the title in the last seven years. Azarenka is also a two-time champion at Melbourne Park. Ninth-seeded Maria Sakkari was among the early winners on Monday, and said after beating McCartney Kessler 6-3, 6-1 that the women's draw is wide open. ""We could name like 20, 25 girls that could win the tournament right now,"" Sakkari said. Seventh-seeded Jasmine Paolini, the French Open runner-up last month, got past the first round at Wimbledon for the first time on her fourth try. The Italian beat Sara Sorribes Tormo 7-5, 6-3. On the men's side, fifth-seeded Daniil Medvedev beat Aleksander Kovacevic 6-3, 6-4, 6-2, and eighth-seeded Casper Ruud defeated Alex Bolt 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-4. Unseeded Canadian Denis Shapovalov eliminated No. 19 Nicolas Jarry 6-1, 7-5, 6-4. Also Monday, former Grand Slam champions Coco Gauff and Emma Raducanu were set to play matches at Centre Court. Raducanu won the 2021 U.S. Open at age 18, but she has been dealing with various injuries since then. Her scheduled opponent - 22nd-seeded Ekaterina Alexandrova - withdrew Monday because of illness. Alexandrova was replaced by Renata Zarazua, a ""lucky loser"" from the qualifying tournament. Gauff, who won the U.S. Open last September, closes out the day's schedule in the main stadium against Caroline Dolehide in an all-American matchup.

Alcaraz won the U.S. Open in 2022 on hard courts, Wimbledon in 2023 on grass and now will play for the championship on the red clay at Roland Garros after coming back to eliminate Sinner in a grueling match that stretched across 4 hours, 9 minutes. ""It's one of the toughest matches that I've played, for sure,"" said Alcaraz, who actually won two fewer points than Sinner, 147-145. ""The toughest matches that I played in my short career have been against Jannik."" The No. 3-seeded Alcaraz will face Alexander Zverev or Casper Ruud in Sunday's final. It is the first men's title match at the French Open since 2004 without any of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer. Djokovic was the defending champion in Paris, but withdrew before the quarterfinals after tearing the meniscus in his right knee and had surgery this week. Because he failed to get back to the final, he will drop from atop the ATP rankings, allowing Sinner to rise a spot from No. 2, despite his defeat on Friday. Sinner entered the semifinals with a 13-0 record in Grand Slam play in 2024 after winning the Australian Open in January. But the 22-year-old Italian also showed up in Paris with a lingering hip injury that forced him to sit out the clay-court tournament in Rome last month. No. 4 Zverev of Germany and No. 7 Ruud of Norway were scheduled to meet in the second semifinal Friday. Zverev's domestic abuse case in Berlin ended earlier in the day, when he reached an out-of-court settlement with his accuser, a former girlfriend. Alcaraz vs. Sinner began in the afternoon under a blue sky, with nary a cloud in sight and the court swathed in sunlight. They are seen as the future of men's tennis. The present isn't too shabby, either. Even though this was not necessarily the most aesthetically pleasing of their nine head-to-head meetings - Alcaraz now leads 5-4 - and they combined for 102 unforced errors, there were moments of brilliance that generated dueling clap-accompanied chants of each man's first name from the Court Philippe Chatrier crowd. Both men were troubled physically in the third set, but it was Sinner who took it. Alcaraz flexed his right hand as it began to cramp; Sinner got his right forearm and left leg massaged. It brought to mind last year's French Open semifinals, when Alcaraz got off to a terrific start against Djokovic but then was hit in the third set by full-body cramps that rendered the remainder of the match anticlimactic. ""I learned from last year's match against Djokovic, when I was in the same position as today,"" Alcaraz said. ""I know that, in this moment, you have to be calm, you have to keep going, because the cramp is going to go away. You have to stay there, fighting."" Indeed, he never wavered, often using drop shots - sometimes to win points outright, sometimes to set up curling lobs, sometimes to pave the way for slick passing shots or his booming forehand. In the fifth set, with shadows covering more than half the court, Alcaraz moved out front by sliding until he could reach across his body to snap a backhand passing winner for a break point. A forehand winner - one of his 30 in the match - made it 2-0 at the 3½-hour mark, earning a yell of ""Vamos!"" from his coach, 2003 French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero. Soon, it was 3-0, and Alcaraz was on his way. Both players walloped the ball with such force that the ball-off-strings thuds elicited gasps from spectators in the middle of points. Sinner, his rust-colored shirt a few shades darker than the clay, came out ready at the start of the match, barely ever missing, gliding more than grinding along the baseline, stretching his long limbs to get to nearly everything Alcaraz offered. Alcaraz, his right arm covered by a white sleeve, would deliver a powerful shot to a corner, punctuated with a grunt, and Sinner would somehow get to it, flip it back and draw a mistake. Sinner led 4-0 and it took Alcaraz 20 minutes of striving to simply place a ""1"" beside his name on the scoreboard. The key statistic in that set: On points that lasted four strokes or fewer, each player took 13. But of those that lasted any longer, Sinner held a 19-8 advantage. Alcaraz would start trying to shorten the points as the match wore on. The second set began inauspiciously for Alcaraz, who fell behind 2-0. But he did not go quietly. He turned things around right when he needed to, using a five-game run to take control of that set. And then, after Sinner led two sets to one, Alcaraz pushed the proceedings to a fifth, closing the fourth with a cross-court backhand winner, then raising his right fist and shaking it. With his strokes, somehow, gaining zest, and the crowd, somehow, getting louder, Alcaraz never let his early edge in the final set wane. ""You have to find the joy (while) suffering. That's the key. Even more on clay, here at Roland Garros. Long rallies. Four-hour matches. Five sets,"" Alcaraz said. ""You have to fight. You have to suffer. But as I told my team many, many times, you have to enjoy suffering.""","the, his, open, set, french, court, zverev, clay, carlos, juan, ferrero, chatrier, match, hour, strokes, backhand, forehand, alcaraz, passing, sets"

She even got a chance to hit some tennis balls with actress Courteney Cox - who played Monica Geller on the show - shortly before the start of the French Open. So on Saturday evening, a few hours after winning her fourth championship at Roland Garros and major trophy No. 5 overall, Swiatek was wearing custom-made white sneakers that her shoe sponsor stenciled with the words, ""The One Where She Wins Her Fifth Grand Slam"" in all capital letters, a nod to the names given to the sitcom's episodes. At the rate Swiatek is going, that celebratory flourish might need to be updated. And often. She only turned 23 a little more than a week ago, after all, and the way she is accumulating titles and overwhelming most opponents, particularly on clay, make it easy to assume there are more on the horizon. ""She's the queen here,"" said French Open tournament director Amelie Mauresmo, a former No. 1-ranked player who won two major titles. Even before this latest triumph, capped by a 6-2, 6-1 win against Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's final, Chris Evert was prepared to say that her women's record of seven French Opens eventually will be surpassed by Swiatek, observing: ""She just has all the ingredients to be a champion. She really does. She checks all the boxes - the intangibles and the tangibles."" Asked if she agreed with that assessment, Paolini let out a hearty laugh and replied, ""Definitely."" Swiatek is far less likely to offer any such pronouncements. ""It's nice to hear such words about myself. But, still, I'm not thinking in these categories, because even being here and winning five Slams seems pretty surreal. I would never expect it when I was younger,"" said Swiatek, who is 35-2 over her career in Paris, including a current 21-match winning streak that made her the first woman with three straight titles there since Justine Henin in 2005-07. ""Getting to (double) digits here seems like still a long shot. So I'll for sure work for it and you can expect that I'll do my best to become a better and better player every year and to play my best tennis here,"" Swiatek said. ""Hearing this from Chrissie is really great, and I'm grateful for her and her words."" In addition to winning four of the past five tournaments at Roland Garros, Swiatek collected the top prize at the 2022 U.S. Open. She's been a semifinalist at the Australian Open and a quarterfinalist at Wimbledon, where play begins on July 1. Improving on grass is probably the next logical step in Swiatek's development. But rather than look too far ahead, let's examine what's happened in the first half of 2024. Swiatek is now 43-4 with five titles this season, which means she's won more than half of the events she's entered, while reaching the semifinals at two others. At her past three tournaments, all on clay, she is 19-0, becoming the first woman since Serena Williams in 2013 to win the Madrid Open, Italian Open and French Open back-to-back-to-back. Her lead atop the WTA rankings is so massive that she would have remained at No. 1 next week even with a first-round loss in Paris. ""These numbers are not, let's say, normal. (They) are something unbelievable,"" Paolini said. ""She's an unbelievable player."" What Swiatek does, Paolini explained, is stay right at the baseline and take balls early. She uses a lot of topspin. Her shots came back so much speedier than those of other women. And her defense can be frustrating. Swiatek did have moments - if fleeting - when she faced a challenge over the past two weeks. In the second round, she needed to save a match point against four-time major champion Naomi Osaka. In the semifinals, Swiatek went down a break at 3-1 in the second set against 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff before taking five of the remaining six games. In the final, Swiatek got broken to trail 2-1, but then reeled off 10 straight games. What's it like trying to stop her once she gets going like that? ""It's hard,"" said Paolini, who will jump from No. 15 to No. 7 in the rankings after her first Slam final. The question on plenty of other people's minds is how many more of these matches Swiatek can win. She is now 5-0 in title matches at majors and says she still feels pressure ahead of those biggest of moments. Including Saturday. ""It was an emotional win, because I felt a lot of stress yesterday and today in the morning. And I knew if I'm going to just focus on tennis, I can kind of fight through it, and at the end, it all went how I wanted,"" Swiatek said. ""So I just felt really proud of myself.""","her, open, the, slam, swiatek, french, amelie, mauresmo, courteney, words, titles, gauff, rankings, cox, iga, coco, grand, tennis, tournaments, champion"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/australian-open-keys-upsets-2-time-champion-sabalenka-in-womens-final-for-1st-grand-slam-title,Australian Open: Keys upsets 2-time champion Sabalenka in women's final for 1st Grand Slam title,Associated Press,2025-01-25 18:02:15,"MELBOURNE, JANUARY 25 When Madison Keys stepped into Rod Laver Arena at 7:37 p.m. on Saturday night ahead of the Australian Open final, she strode right past the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup, the silver trophy that goes to the women's champion and was placed on a pedestal near the entrance to the court. Keys didn't break stride. Didn't stop to stare. That bit of hardware was then moved near the net for the pre-match coin toss, close as can be to where the American stood. Close enough to touch. Close enough to feel real. Also right there was Aryna Sabalenka, the No. 1-ranked woman and two-time defending champion at Melbourne Park, who would not make things easy on this cool, breezy evening. Exactly 2 1/2 hours - and one 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 victory over Sabalenka - later, there was Keys, smiling the widest smile while holding that bit of hardware with both hands, a Grand Slam champion for the first time at age 29. This was Keys' second chance to play for a major title: The first ended in a lopsided loss at the 2017 U.S. Open, an experience that taught her she had to play through nerves. ""I have wanted this for so long,"" said Keys, who was born in Illinois and now is based in Florida, ""and I have been in one other Grand Slam final, and it didn't go my way, and I didn't know if I was going to get back in this position."" She is the oldest woman to become a first-time Slam champ since Flavia Pennetta was 33 at the 2015 U.S. Open. This was the 46th Slam appearance for Keys, the third most before winning a major title, behind only Pennetta's 49 and Marion Bartoli's 47 when she won Wimbledon in 2013. Keys did not take an easy path, either. Before this three-set victory came one against No. 2 Iga Swiatek in the semifinals, saving a match point along the way. Not since Serena Williams in 2005 had a player defeated both of the WTA's top two women at Melbourne Park. ""Madison: Wow, what a tournament,"" Sabalenka said during the on-court ceremony, in which she also joked with her entourage that the defeat was their fault. ""Enjoy the celebration,"" she told Keys. ""Enjoy the really fun part."" Keys, ranked 14th and seeded 19th, prevented Sabalenka from earning what would have been her third women's trophy in a row at the Australian Open - something last accomplished by Martina Hingis from 1997-99 - and her fourth major title overall. When it ended, Keys covered her face with her hands, then raised her arms. Soon, she was hugging her husband, Bjorn Fratangelo - who has been her coach since 2023 - and other members of her team, before sitting on her sideline bench and laughing. Sabalenka chucked her racket afterward, then covered her head with a white towel. ""Just wasn't my day,"" Sabalenka said. Keys broke three times in the first set, helped in part by Sabalenka's four double-faults and 13 total unforced errors. Don't for a moment think this was merely an instance of Sabalenka being her own undoing. Keys certainly had a lot to do with the way things were going, too. She compiled an 11-4 edge in winners in the opening set, managing to out-hit the big-hitting Sabalenka repeatedly. For a stretch, it seemed as though every shot off the strings of Keys' racket - the one she switched to ahead of this season, at Fratangelo's urging, to protect her oft-injured right shoulder and to make it easier to control her considerable power - was landing precisely where she wanted. Near a corner. On a line. Out of the reach of Sabalenka, a 26-year-old from Belarus. Also important was the way Keys, whose left thigh was taped for the match, covered every part of the court, racing to get to balls and send them back over the net with intent. On one terrific defensive sequence, she sprinted for a forehand that drew a forehand into the net from Sabalenka, capping a break for a 4-1 lead. Never one to hide her emotions during a match, Sabalenka frequently displayed frustration while trailing on the scoreboard, kicking a ball after netting a volley, dropping her racket after missing an overhead, slapping her leg after an errant forehand. Sabalenka took a trip to the locker room before the second set, and whether that helped clear her head or slowed Keys' momentum - or both - the final's complexion soon changed. Keys' first-serve percentage dipped from 86% in the first set to 59% in the second. Sabalenka raised her winner total to 13 in the second set and began accumulating, and converting, break points. When she sent a backhand down the line to force an error by Keys for a break and a 2-1 lead in the second, Sabalenka shook her left fist and gritted her teeth as she walked to the sideline. The action in the third set was tight and tense, without so much as a single break point until its final game, when Keys came through with one last forehand winner. Here's how close this was: Keys won just one more point than Sabalenka, 92-91. Both finished with 29 winners. Keys had to wait, yes, but the moment she yearned for had arrived.","her, the, keys, slam, sabalenka, set, forehand, open, fratangelo, iga, swiatek, grand, sideline, racket, one, match, title, melbourne, daphne, pedestal"

She had a hard time believing it all. The comeback. What Keys called an ""extra dramatic finish."" The victory over five-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek, who'd been on the most dominant run at Melbourne Park in a dozen years. And now the chance to play in her second Grand Slam final, a long wait after being the 2017 U.S. Open runner-up. ""I'm still trying to catch up to everything that's happening,"" said the 19th-seeded Keys, who will face No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, the two-time defending champion, for the trophy Saturday. ""I felt like I was just fighting to stay in it. ... It was so up and down and so many big points."" Just to be sure, Keys asked whether Swiatek was, indeed, one point from victory. Yes, Madison, she was, while serving at 6-5, 40-30, but missed a backhand into the net, then eventually getting broken by double-faulting, sending the contest to a first-to-10, win-by-two tiebreaker. ""I felt like I blacked out there at some point,"" Keys said, ""and was out there running around."" Whatever she was doing, it worked. Keys claimed more games in the semifinal than the 14 total that Swiatek dropped in her five previous matches over the past two weeks. Sabalenka beat good friend Paula Badosa 6-4, 6-2 earlier Thursday. Sabalenka, a 26-year-old from Belarus, can become the first woman since 1999 to complete a threepeat. ""If she plays like this,"" the 11th-seeded Badosa said, ""I mean, we can already give her the trophy."" Keys might have something to say about that. Still, Sabalenka won her first major trophy at Melbourne Park in 2023, and she since has added two more - in Australia a year ago and at the U.S. Open last September. The last woman to reach three finals in a row at the year's first Grand Slam tournament was Serena Williams, who won two from 2015-17. Martina Hingis was the most recent woman with a threepeat, doing it from 1997-1999. ""I have goosebumps. I'm so proud of myself,"" Sabalenka said. Swiatek had not lost a single service game since the first round, but was broken three times by Keys in the first set alone and eight times in all. That included each of Swiatek's first two times serving, making clear right from the get-go this would not be her usual sort of day. And while Swiatek did eke out the opening set, she was overwhelmed in the second, trailing 5-0 before getting a game. This was the big-hitting Keys at her very best. She turns 30 next month and, at the suggestion of her coach, former player Bjorn Fratangelo - who also happens to be her husband - decided to try a new racket this season, an effort both to help her with generating easy power but also to relieve some strain on her right shoulder. It's certainly paid immediate dividends. Keys is now on an 11-match winning streak, including taking the title at a tuneup event in Adelaide. She was good enough to get through this one, which was as tight as can be down the stretch. ""At the end, I feel like we were both kind of battling some nerves. ... It just became who can get that final point and who can be a little bit better than the other one,"" Keys said. ""And I'm happy it was me."" Sabalenka, a 26-year-old from Belarus, trailed 2-0, 40-love at the start but quickly figured things out, especially once Rod Laver Arena's retractable roof was shut in the first set because of a drizzle. She straightened her strokes and overpowered Badosa, who eliminated No. 3 Coco Gauff to reach her first major semifinal. ""She started to be very, very aggressive"" said Badosa, who thought about retiring last year while dealing with a stress fracture in her back. ""Everything was working."" Sabalenka and Badosa did their best to avoid any eye contact for much of the evening, whether up at the net for the coin toss or when they crossed paths at changeovers. When their match was over, they met for a lengthy hug. During Sabalenka's on-court interview, she joked about taking Badosa - who by then was sitting in a hallway, her head bowed - on a shopping spree to make things up to her, paying for whatever the Spaniard wants. Told what Sabalenka said, Badosa noted: ""It's going to be something really expensive.""","her, the, slam, open, swiatek, keys, grand, first, semifinal, badosa, fratangelo, bjorn, melbourne, laver, rod, gauff, aryna, sabalenka, coco, iga"

Swiatek's latest lopsided win came via a 6-1, 6-2 scoreline in the quarterfinals against No. 8 seed Emma Navarro on Wednesday. The No. 2-seeded Swiatek not only has not dropped a set so far in the tournament, but also has lost a grand total of only 14 games as she seeks her first title at Melbourne Park and sixth Grand Slam trophy overall. Sharapova was the last woman to reach the Australian Open semifinals having dropped fewer than 15 games. ""She does everything with 100% conviction and intensity,"" Navarro said about Swiatek. ""She has a different style of movement and play. It's tough to not be sort of affected by that and not feel like, 'OK, I have to do everything at the same speed that she's doing it.' So that was something, for sure, I felt a little bit today."" Swiatek will face No. 19 Madison Keys of the U.S. on Thursday night for a berth in the final. The other women's semifinal is No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, the two-time defending champion, against her good friend, No. 11 Paula Badosa. Keys, whose best showing at a major was getting to the title match at the 2017 U.S. Open, was a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 winner against Elina Svitolina and is into her third semifinal in Australia. ""Iga is tough to beat because she has a lot of spin, kind of naturally, on both sides. She's a good server. She's a good returner. She moves incredibly well,"" Keys said. ""The biggest thing that makes her so difficult to beat is, because she moves so well, if you miss your spot just slightly, she has enough time to recover, and then the point goes back to neutral."" There's an American in the men's semifinals, too: No. 21 Ben Shelton got that far in Melbourne for the first time with an entertaining 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (4) win over unseeded Lorenzo Sonego of Italy. At his news conference, Shelton was critical of some of the people handling post-match TV interviewing duties. Shelton was a semifinalist at the 2023 U.S. Open and now will meet No. 1 Jannik Sinner, the defending champion, on Friday. Sinner was relentless against No. 8 Alex de Minaur, the last Australian male in the bracket, on Wednesday night, beating him 6-3, 6-2, 6-1. ""He is one of the best servers on tour,"" Sinner said about Shelton. ""Lefty. Different rotation of the ball ... hopefully, I'm ready."" The other men's semifinal Friday is Novak Djokovic vs. Alexander Zverev. Against Navarro, Swiatek benefited from a no-call of a double bounce on a point she won in the second set. Because Navarro continued playing the point and did not immediately stop to ask for a video review, she wasn't allowed to have the sequence checked. Either way, Swiatek's dominance was pretty clear, even if she was modest about things afterward. ""Well, I think it was much tougher than the score says,"" said Swiatek, a 23-year-old from Poland. ""Emma's a fighter ... and I wanted to stay focused and keep my intensity."" Swiatek has won four of five career matchups against Keys, 29. ""Madison is a great player and experienced, so you never know,"" Swiatek said. ""I'll be just focused on myself."" Using a new racket this season, Keys is on a 10-match winning streak, including a title at a hard-court tune-up event in Adelaide. Her run to the semifinals in Melbourne includes victories over two past runners-up at the Australian Open, Danielle Collins and Elena Rybakina. Keys' past losses in the semifinals in Melbourne came against eventual champions Serena Williams in 2015 and Ash Barty in 2022. ""I think I play a little bit smarter for sure ... probably a little bit less fearless,"" Keys said. Svitolina, a three-time Slam semifinalist, was in control during the first set. But Keys made some tactical adjustments, including looking for more opportunities to get to the net. She won 23 of the 26 points when she moved forward and ended up with a total of 49 winners, 23 on her powerful forehand side. The one difficulty Keys had was getting going in her return games. But she finally converted her seventh break chance to lead 4-2 in the second set. Keys said: ""Getting to the point where I'm starting to appreciate my career for what it has been, and it doesn't have to have a Grand Slam in order for me to look at it and say, 'I've done a really good job, and I've really left everything out there.' Now, while that's obviously still the goal, there have been periods of my career where it felt like if I didn't win one, then I hadn't done enough. ""That kind of took a lot of the fun out of the game, and there were times where it felt paralyzing out on the court because it felt as if I needed it to happen, instead of giving myself the opportunity to go out and potentially do it.""","the, open, swiatek, her, australian, keys, semifinals, slam, sonego, minaur, semifinal, badosa, emma, no, shelton, paula, set, semifinalist, grand, lorenzo"

The No. 1-ranked Sinner, a 23-year-old from Italy, fell behind in the opening set and twice was a point from losing it when Shelton served at 6-5. But Sinner broke there, then dominated the ensuing tiebreaker, and broke again to begin the second set. ""It was a very tough first set, but a very crucial one,"" said Sinner, who ran his winning streak to 20 matches dating to late last season. Shelton is a 22-year-old American who now is 0-2 in Grand Slam semifinals. ""I know I'm close,"" he said. ""I know my level's close."" Sinner described the matchup against the 21st-seeded Shelton at Melbourne Park as filled with ""a lot of tension."" ""I'm very happy with how I handled the situation today,"" Sinner said. The only trouble he ran into in the last two sets of the 2 1/2-hour contest in Rod Laver Arena was when he clutched at his left hamstring, and then his right thigh, in the third. He was treated by a trainer, who massaged both of Sinner's legs during changeovers. Sinner is now the youngest man since Jim Courier in 1992-93 to reach consecutive finals at the Australian Open. It was Courier who conducted the post-match interview with Sinner on Friday. Sinner won his first major title at Melbourne Park a year ago, then grabbed No. 2 at the U.S. Open in September, shortly after being exonerated in a doping case that is still under appeal. There is a hearing scheduled for April. On Sunday, Sinner will try to add to his trophy haul when he faces No. 2 Alexander Zverev for the championship. Zverev advanced to his third major final - he is 0-2, with both losses in five sets - when Novak Djokovic quit after one set of their semifinal Friday because of a leg injury. ""Everything can happen. He's an incredible player,"" Sinner said about Zverev. ""He's looking for his first major. There's going to be, again, a lot of tension."" Shelton regretted being unable to close out the initial set. ""I've made my living on tour, so far, serving out sets and being able to serve out sets. Having two set points on my serve, serving at 6-5, I feel like (it was) uncharacteristic for me not to come through and win that,"" said Shelton, who reached the semifinals at the 2023 U.S. Open. ""Obviously you're playing the No. 1 player in the world. The chances, the windows, are always small. Sometimes you miss your window, and the guy steps up his level, starts making a lot more first serves, playing better. The break chances don't come as often.""","set, sinner, open, the, slam, melbourne, shelton, zverev, grand, his, sets, jannik, third, alexander, semifinals, cramping, australian, major, courier, chances"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/jannik-sinner-beats-alexander-zverev-in-3-sets-for-his-second-australian-open-title-in-a-row,Jannik Sinner beats Alexander Zverev in 3 sets for his second Australian Open title in a row,Associated Press,2025-01-26 20:51:36,"MELBOURNE, JANUARY 26 There's all sorts of ways beyond merely the score to measure just how dominant Jannik Sinner was while outplaying and frustrating Alexander Zverev during the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory Sunday that earned the 23-year-old Italian a second consecutive Australian Open championship. The zero break points Sinner faced. Or the 10 he accumulated. The 27-13 advantage in points that lasted at least nine strokes. Or the way Sinner accumulated more winners, 32 to 25, and fewer unforced errors, 27 to 45. The way Sinner won 10 of the 13 points that ended with him at the net. Or the way he only let Zverev go 14 of 27 in that category, frequently zipping passing shots out of reach. Well, here's is one more bit of evidence: what Zverev said about Sinner. ""I'm serving better than him, but that's it. He does everything else better than me. He moves better than me. He hits his forehand better than me. He hits his backhand better than me. He returns better than me. He volleys better than me,"" Zverev said. ""At the end of the day, tennis has five or six massive shots - like, massive factors - and he does four or five of them better than me. That's the reason why he won."" High praise from a guy who is, after all, ranked No. 2. Sinner has held the No. 1 spot since last June and is not showing any signs of relinquishing it. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019, when No. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal - also in straight sets. ""It's amazing,"" Sinner said, ""to achieve these things."" The ""things"" include being the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93, and the first man since Nadal at the French Open in 2005 and 2006 to follow up his first Grand Slam title by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later. Sinner was asked later whether he felt more relief or excitement when he raised his arms after the last point was his. ""This one was joy. We managed to do something incredible this time, because the situation I was in was completely different from a year ago here,"" he said. ""I had more pressure."" Probably true, but's hard to tell. Go to the start of 2024, and take stock. In that span, Sinner has won three of the five major tournaments, including the U.S. Open in September, meaning he now has claimed three straight hard-court Slams. His record is 80-6 with nine titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches. ""There's always something that can get better,"" said one of his two coaches, Simone Vagnozzi. ""He is playing really well right now and everything comes easily. But there will be tough moments ahead."" The only thing that's clouded the past 12 months for Sinner, it seems, is the doping case in which his exoneration was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner initially was cleared in August; a hearing in the WADA appeal is scheduled for April. ""I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened,"" Sinner said Sunday. ""I know if I would be guilty, I would not play like this."" While he became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals, Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3, adding this loss to those at the 2020 U.S. Open and last year's French Open. Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all. ""I'll keep doing everything I can,"" Zverev said, ""to lift one of those trophies."" Just before Zverev began speaking into a microphone during the trophy ceremony, a voice cried out from the stands, making reference to two of the player's ex-girlfriends who accused him of physical abuse. During the match, there truly was only one moment that contained a hint of tension. It came when Zverev was two points from owning the second set at 5-4, love-30. But a break point - and a set point - never arrived. A year ago, Sinner went through a lot more trouble to earn his first major, needing to get past Novak Djokovic - who quit one set into his semifinal against Zverev on Friday because of a torn hamstring - before erasing a two-set deficit in the final against 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev. This time, Sinner applied pressure with an all-around style that does not really appear to have holes. He proved superior in every meaningful way other than aces, leaving Zverev shaking his head or trudging to the sideline with shoulders sagging or cracking his racket against the court or against another racket. Perfectly understandable, given what Sinner can do to an opponent, especially on a hard court. ""The facts speak for themselves,"" Zverev said. ""He's in a different universe right now.""","open, the, his, sets, australian, french, slam, daniil, nadal, doping, set, medvedev, grand, rafael, racket, jannik, year, sinner, row, court"

With Lionel Messi watching, Djokovic cruised into the Miami Open final by routing 14th-seeded Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 on Friday at Hard Rock Stadium. The fourth-seeded Djokovic will try for a seventh Miami Open title on Sunday against unseeded 19-year-old upstart Jakub Mensik, who won a thriller decided by a third-set tiebreaker over No. 3 seed Taylor Fritz in Friday's other semifinal, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4). The 37-year-old Djokovic, who won six times at the tournament's previous venue at Key Biscayne, also is going for his 100th professional title. He has been out of form this year, starting with an injury retirement at the Australian Open in January. Earlier this month, he lost his first match at Indian Wells to Botic van de Zandschulp. In his on-court interview, Djokovic acknowledged the presence of Messi, who plays for Major League Soccer's Inter Miami, calling him ""King Leo."" Djokovic said Messi visited the locker room with his wife and children and they ""exchanged gifts."" Djokovic has seen Messi play live before but this was the first time the soccer great watched him. ""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honor. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense. ""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that."" The match was disrupted during the third game when a fan was removed by security. The chair umpire came down to the court and called for security as he walked toward the stands. Dimitrov had jawed with the fan and came over to the sideline to point out the heckler to the umpire. ""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.'' Dimitrov eliminated Francisco Cerundulo in the quarters. He stayed on the court for 25 minutes after the victory, sitting in a wheelchair because of dizziness. He was helped off by tournament medical personnel and canceled his post-match news conference. Dimitrov said he was given lots of water and ice but added ""I don't have a recollection of exactly what happened. We're putting our bodies through so much. It's one of those matches where you have to carry me out of the court somehow.'' Djokovic was broken by Dimitrov in the first game, but he quickly settled down and closed out the first set in 32 minutes. The men's leader with 24 Grand Slam titles made 87% of his first serves, missing just six all match on a breezy day. He also committed only five unforced errors in the 70-minute match. ""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated."" The Serbian improved to 13-1 against Dimitrov in his career. The Bulgarian pulled out the ultimate superlative. ""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on Earth possess that quality.'' Mensik hasn't been to an ATP 1,000-point final and came in to the Miami Open ranked 54th. He showed nerves of steel against Fritz at 4-4 in the deciding tiebreaker, winning the last three points. Mensik, who didn't post a service break all match, blasted a backhand winner down the line for 5-4. Fritz hit a forehand long off a 20-shot rally and punched a forehand in the net on double match point to end the two hour and 25-minute nightcard. Mensik shook hands with Messi before the match. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said. Mensik credits Djokovic as the reason he picked up tennis. He lost to Djokovic in Shanghai Masters in a three-setter last October. Djokovic will have 18 years on his opponent. ""It feels incredible, unbelievable (to play him),'' Mensik said. ""It was a dream to play against him in Shanghai.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/novak-djokovics-players-association-sued-the-groups-that-run-tennis-why-and-what-do-they-want,Novak Djokovic's players' association sued the groups that run tennis. Why and what do they want?,Associated Press,2025-03-20 21:06:52,"MIAMI GARDENS, MARCH 20 Ons Jabeur is a three-time Grand Slam finalist with more than $13 million in prize money by age 30, and as she looked out at the main court used for the Miami Open this week and next, she rattled off a lengthy list of things she thinks could be fixed in professional tennis to help all players. ""We need to improve the structure that we have. ... We can do better about the scheduling. The times of matches. There are a lot of tournaments, and health-wise, for the players, I don't think that helps. The balls changing every week is not a good thing. Players deserve to be paid better,"" said Jabeur, a member of the executive committee of the Professional Tennis Players' Association, a group co-founded by Novak Djokovic several years ago. ""Definitely a lot of things to work on."" Those issues Jabeur mentioned were among those raised in a class-action antitrust lawsuit filed by the PTPA in federal court in New York on Tuesday, calling the groups in charge of the sport - the women's (WTA) and men's (ATP) tours, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the agency that oversees anti-doping and anti-corruption efforts (ITIA) - a ""cartel."" ""The players really do demand to be heard, to have their issues taken seriously, to address these structural issues that plague tennis and really choke it as an international sport,"" said PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar, ""and to create a system that brings balance and equality and fairness to really the entire business of tennis."" Here is a look at the lawsuit - and there are similar actions moving forward in Brussels and London - and what it could mean for tennis: What is the PTPA? The PTPA was founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil and announced to the world just before the 2020 U.S. Open. The aim was to represent players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport; tennis does not have a full-fledged union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements as in team sports. The PTPA said it met with more than 250 players - women and men, and a majority of the top 20 in the WTA and ATP rankings - before going to court. Why did tennis players sue those in charge of the sport? The lawsuit seeks more money for players, yes, and lays out a series of other complaints about the way the sport is run. That includes criticisms related to giving too little of the sport's revenues to players, limiting prize money each tournament can offer, preventing competition from rival tours or events, a ""45-week-per-year schedule,"" the increased number of combined WTA-ATP events that last 12 days apiece, match schedules that sometimes keep players on court well past midnight, a rankings system that restricts which events the athletes enter, and a ""heavy-handed approach"" by the International Tennis Integrity Agency that the lawsuit termed ""arbitrary and selective."" ""Player welfare is completely disregarded in everything, from the tour schedule to anti-competitive practices, to abusing our rights around name, image, likeness,"" Pospisil said. Why were the Grand Slam tournaments not named as defendants? The PTPA classified the four major events - Wimbledon, U.S. Open, French Open and Australian Open - as co-conspirators that fall under the ITF, rather than making them separate defendants. According to the filing, those four Grand Slam tournaments ""generated over $1.5 billion collectively in 2024, while only paying between (10% to 20%) of revenue to players."" But, Nassar said, ""The Slams can't unilaterally fix the schedule. They can't fix anti-doping. They can't fix the medical issues. They can't fix the prize money conspiracy and price-fixing that exists at every other level at every other tournament."" Why is Djokovic not a plaintiff? Who are some of the players named? Pospisil is listed as a plaintiff - 2022 Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios, Sorana Cirstea, Varvara Gracheva, Reilly Opelka and Tennys Sandgren are some of the others - while Djokovic is not. ""This is about much more than one player,"" Nassar said, noting that Djokovic, as a member of the executive committee, is ""very involved, very up to speed."" What was the response from defendants such as the WTA and ATP? The WTA called the filing ""regrettable and misguided."" The ATP said the case is ""entirely without merit,"" and added: ""The PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress. ... The PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising."" What could the lawsuit mean for tennis in the short term and the long term? As with many a lawsuit, it is hard to know what the long-term effects could be, of course, although this certainly puts in black and white the schism that exists between the sport's leaders and many of its athletes. Maybe there will be a settlement? Maybe the players will get nowhere and nothing will be different? Maybe there will be a court ruling that forces change? If the latter happens, PTPA lawyer Jim Quinn predicted, ""It's going to require a restructuring.""","the, wta, tennis, atp, ptpa, players, lawsuit, sport, slam, djokovic, grand, open, miami, novak, itf, jabeur, nassar, ons, quinn, rankings"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/trump-says-ukraine-started-the-war-thats-killing-its-citizens-what-are-the-facts,Trump says Ukraine started the war that's killing its citizens. What are the facts?,Associated Press,2025-02-20 21:11:11,"KYIV, FEBRUARY 20 President Donald Trump this week falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war that has cost tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives, causing outrage and alarm in a country that has spent nearly three years fighting back a much larger Russian military. Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy "" a dictator without elections"" and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom. Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the disinformation is coming from Russia, and some of what Trump has said does echo Russia's own narrative of the conflict. Here's a look at some of Trump's statements: Ukraine 'should have never started it' WHAT TRUMP SAID: ""You've been there for three years. You should have ended it ... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal."" THE FACTS: Russia's army crossed the border on Feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out invasion that Putin sought to justify by falsely saying it was needed to protect Russian-speaking civilians in eastern Ukraine and prevent the country from joining NATO. But Russia's aggression against Ukraine didn't start then. In 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin saw signs that Ukraine was pulling away from Russia's sphere of influence, seeking alliances with western European nations. Putin illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula and started an armed aggression in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas that grew into a long-running conflict that left thousands dead. That conflict simmered until 2022, when Putin ordered what he called military exercises along Ukraine's borders. He told the world that the roughly 150,000 soldiers that he had amassed would not be used to invade Ukraine. But in the early hours of Feb. 24, Russia launched widespread airstrikes and soldiers began pouring over the border. Ukraine should hold elections WHAT TRUMP SAID: ""We have a situation where we haven't had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law,"" Trump said in Mar-a-Lago, adding on Wednesday in a post on social media: ""A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left."" THE FACTS: Zelenskyy was elected to a five-year term in 2019, and the next presidential elections had been scheduled for spring 2024. But Ukrainian law prohibits parliamentary or presidential elections during a state of martial law, so Zelenskyy has remained in office. He has said he believes elections will be held in Ukraine after martial law is lifted. The country would need to amend the law if it decided to hold a vote. There are numerous factors that, according to Ukraine's government, ""would render it literally impossible to ensure a fair electoral process in the circumstances of a total war."" According to the United Nations' refugee agency, some 6.9 million Ukrainian refugees have been registered worldwide since February 2022. Of those, millions remain outside the country due to the war. It would be nearly impossible for all of those who have been displaced to participate in an election, potentially robbing millions of their right to vote. Furthermore, around 800,000 soldiers are currently serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces as they struggle to contain Russian advances. An election would necessitate pulling soldiers off the front lines to vote, weakening Ukraine's military position. Additionally, those fighting would be unable to run for office, a right that is guaranteed to them by Ukrainian law. Many Ukrainians are living in areas under Russian occupation, essentially precluding their participation in any electoral process. And since Russia continues to regularly strike both military and civilian targets across the country, packing millions of citizens into crowded polling places could create additional danger. Zelenskyy's support at rock bottom? WHAT TRUMP SAID: ""The leader in Ukraine, I mean, I hate to say it, but he's down at 4% approval rating."" THE FACTS: Zelenskyy ""retains a fairly high level of public trust"" - about 57 percent - according to a report released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Speaking in Kyiv on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said the number given by Trump, for which the president cited no sources, was ""disinformation"" that originated in Russia, and that the president ""unfortunately lives in this disinformation space."" Zelenskyy said he will ask pollsters in the coming weeks to conduct surveys on the public's trust in him and share the results with the Trump administration. Millions of deaths WHAT TRUMP SAID: ""When you see what's taken place in Ukraine with millions of people killed, including the soldiers, millions of people killed, a big percentage of their cities knocked down to the ground, I don't know how anybody even lives there."" THE FACTS: No estimates by any reputable analysis place deaths near the millions. While exact figures of the number of deaths are unknown, Zelenskyy said earlier this month that over 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022. He has also said that ""tens of thousands of civilians"" had been killed in occupied areas of Ukraine, but that no exact figures would be available until the war was over. The most recent data from the Russian Defense Ministry, published in January 2023, pointed to just over 6,000 military deaths, although reports from U.S. and U.K. officials put that number significantly higher.","ukrainian, the, russian, trump, 000, soldiers, disinformation, military, facts, ukraine, russia, dictator, kyiv, zelenskyy, feb, elections, nations, president, conflict, aggression"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/trump-says-he-is-serious-about-canada-becoming-51st-state-in-super-bowl-interview,Trump says he is serious about Canada becoming 51st state in Super Bowl interview,Associated Press,2025-02-10 21:31:59,"WASHINGTON, FEBRUARY 10 President Donald Trump said he is serious about wanting Canada to become the 51st state in an interview that aired Sunday during the Super Bowl preshow. ""Yeah it is,"" Trump told Fox News Channel's Bret Baier when asked whether his talk of annexing Canada is ""a real thing"" - as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently warned. ""I think Canada would be much better off being the 51st state because we lose $200 billion a year with Canada. And I'm not going to let that happen,"" he said. ""Why are we paying $200 billion a year, essentially a subsidy to Canada?"" The U.S. is not subsidizing Canada. The U.S. buys products from the natural resource-rich nation, including commodities like oil. While the trade gap in goods has ballooned in recent years to $72 billion in 2023, the deficit largely reflects America's imports of Canadian energy. Trump has repeatedly suggested that Canada would be better off if it agreed to become the 51st U.S. state - a prospect that is deeply unpopular among Canadians. Trudeau said Friday during a closed-door session with business and labor leaders that Trump's talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state was ""a real thing"" and tied to desire for access to the country's natural resources. ""Mr. Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country and it is a real thing. In my conversations with him on ...,"" Trudeau said, according to CBC, Canada's public broadcaster. ""They're very aware of our resources of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those."" Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday as he traveled to the Super Bowl game in New Orleans, Trump continued to threaten a country that has long been one of the U.S.'s closest allies. He claimed that Canada is ""not viable as a country"" without U.S. trade, and warned that the founding NATO member can no longer depend on the U.S. for military protection. ""You know, they don't pay very much for military. And the reason they don't pay much is they assume that we're going to protect them,"" he said. ""That's not an assumption they can make because - why are we protecting another country?"" In the Fox interview, which was pre-taped this weekend in Florida, Trump also said that he has not seen enough action from Canada and Mexico to stave off the tariffs he has threatened to impose on the country's two largest trading partners once a 30-day extension is up. ""No, it's not good enough,"" he said. ""Something has to happen. It's not sustainable. And I'm changing it."" Trump last week agreed to a 30-day pause on his plan to slap Mexico and Canada with a 25% tariff on all imports except for Canadian oil, natural gas and electricity, which would be taxed at 10%, after the countries took steps to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking. Aboard Air Force One, Trump said that he would on Monday announce a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., including from Canada and Mexico, and unveil a plan for reciprocal tariffs later in the week. ""Very simply it's if they charge us, we charge them,"" he said. Trump's participation in the Super Bowl interview marked a return to tradition. Presidents have typically granted a sit-down to the network broadcasting the game, the most-watched television event of the year. But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, were inconsistent in their participation. Biden declined to participate last year - turning down a massive audience in an election year - and also skipped an appearance in 2023, when efforts by his team to have Biden speak with a Fox Corp. streaming service instead of the main network failed. During his first term, Trump participated three out of four years. Trump was the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl in person - something he told Baier he was surprised to learn. ""I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the president at the game,"" he said. During his flight to New Orleans, Trump signed a proclamation declaring Feb. 9 ""the first ever Gulf of America Day"" as Air Force One flew over the body of water that he renamed by proclamation from the Gulf of Mexico. Trump in the interview, also defended the work of billionaire Elon Musk, whose so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has been drawing deep concern from Democrats as he moves to shut down whole government agencies and fire large swaths of the federal workforce in the name of rooting out waste and inefficiency. Musk, Trump said, has ""been terrific,"" and will target the Department of Education and the military next. ""We're going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse,"" Trump predicted. ""I campaigned on this."" He was also asked about his dancing, which has become a popular meme on social media. ""I don't know what it is,"" he said. ""I try and walk off sometimes without dancing and I can't. I have to dance.""","the, bowl, fox, super, gulf, interview, trump, 51st, canadian, imports, trudeau, baier, bret, corp, justin, country, america, department, his, day"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/hiv-infections-could-jump-over-6-times-if-us-support-is-dropped-and-not-replaced-unaids-chief-says,"HIV infections could jump over 6 times if US support is dropped and not replaced, UNAIDS chief says",Associated Press,2025-02-10 23:07:14,"LONDON, FEBRUARY 10 The head of the U.N. AIDS agency said Monday the number of new HIV infections could jump more than six times by 2029 if American support of the biggest AIDS program is dropped, warning that millions of people could die and more resistant strains of the disease could emerge. In an interview with The Associated Press, UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said HIV infections have been falling in recent years, with just 1.3 million new cases recorded in 2023, a 60% decline since the virus peaked in 1995. But since President Donald Trump's announcement the U.S. would freeze all foreign assistance for 90 days, Byanyima said officials estimate that by 2029, there could be 8.7 million people newly infected with HIV, a tenfold jump in AIDS-related deaths - to 6.3 million - and an additional 3.4 million children made orphans. ""We will see a surge in this disease,"" Byanyima said, speaking from Uganda. ""This will cost lives if the American government doesn't change its mind and maintain its leadership,"" she said, adding that it was not her place to criticize any government's policy. Byanyima pleaded with the Trump administration not to abruptly cut off funding, which she said has resulted in ""panic, fear and confusion"" in many of the African countries hardest hit by AIDS. In one Kenyan county, she said 550 HIV workers were immediately laid off, while thousands of others in Ethiopia were terminated, leaving health officials unable to track the epidemic. She noted that the loss of U.S. funding to HIV programs in some countries was catastrophic, with external funding, mostly from the U.S., accounting for about 90% of their programs. Nearly $400 million goes to countries like Uganda, Mozambique and Tanzania, she said. ""We can work with (the Americans) on how to decrease their contribution if they wish to decrease it,"" she said. Byanyima described the American withdrawal from global HIV efforts as the second biggest crisis the field has ever faced - after the years-long delay it took for poor countries to get the lifesaving antiretrovirals long available in rich countries. Byanyima also said the loss of American support in efforts to combat HIV was coming at another critical time, with the arrival of what she called ""a magical prevention tool"" known as lenacapavir, a twice-yearly shot that was shown to offer complete protection against HIV in women, and which worked nearly as well as for men. Widespread use of that shot, in addition to other interventions to stop HIV, could help end the disease as a public health problem in the next five years, Byanyima said. She also noted that lenacapavir, sold as Sunlenca, was developed by the American company Gilead. International aid, Byanyima said, ""helped an American company to innovate, to come up with something that will pay them millions and millions, but at the same time prevent new infections in the rest of the world."" The freeze in American funding, she said, didn't make economic sense. ""We appeal to the U.S. government to review this, to understand that this is mutually beneficial,"" she said, noting that foreign assistance makes up less than 1% of the overall U.S. budget. ""Why would you need to be so disruptive for that 1%?"" Byanyima said that so far, no other countries or donors have stepped up to fill the void that will be left by the loss of American aid, but that she plans to visit numerous European capitals to speak with global leaders. ""People are going to die because lifesaving tools have been taken away from them,"" she said. ""I have not yet heard of any European country committing to step in, but I know they are listening and trying to see where they can come in because they care about rights, about humanity.""","hiv, american, the, aids, million, infections, unaids, winnie, byanyima, countries, funding, lifesaving, trump, disease, strains, freeze, kenyan, antiretrovirals, programs, aid"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/the-social-media-bill-a-comparison-with-the-theory-of-information-overflow,The Social Media Bill: A comparison with the theory of information overflow,Vidhu Prakash Kayastha,2025-02-10 11:48:20,"In recent years, social media platforms have become integral to everyday life. From shaping political discourse to influencing cultural trends, these platforms have revolutionised the way people communicate, share information and form opinions. However, with the unprecedented surge in online activity, the challenges of managing content and regulating harmful practices have also emerged. In response, the government has introduced the Social Media Bill aimed at addressing concerns such as misinformation, cyberbullying and privacy violations. While this legislation seeks to bring order to the digital landscape, it has sparked a heated debate about its potential to limit free speech and its effectiveness in dealing with the core issue of information overload. To better understand the implications of the Social Media Bill, it is important to critically examine it through the lens of the theory of information overflow, a concept that delves into the consequences of excessive or unregulated information. The Social Media Bill requires platforms to take responsibility for regulating the content uploaded by users. It mandates that harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation or pornography, be removed. Additionally, the bill seeks to protect users' personal data, holding platforms accountable for any breaches or misuse of this information. To further strengthen its reach, the bill expects social media companies to implement systems for reporting and monitoring illegal content, with regular reports provided to the government. Finally, individuals who engage in activities like defamation, cyberbullying or spreading false information could face legal consequences, as the bill enforces criminal accountability for these actions. Despite the bill's intention to regulate harmful content, it has faced significant criticism for its broad scope and potential to stifle freedom of expression. Critics argue that the bill could be used to silence dissent, with the government having the authority to dictate what content is considered ""acceptable"". Moreover, its provisions seem to place the burden of censorship on social media platforms, potentially leading to overregulation and the removal of legitimate speech. The theory of information overflow, or information overload, refers to the state in which an individual or society is exposed to an overwhelming amount of information, making it difficult to process or make sense of it. In the context of social media, this phenomenon can manifest in various ways, including: Social media platforms are overwhelmed with an endless stream of content, much of which can be irrelevant, misleading or unverified. This constant flood of information can create significant cognitive strain for users, who often struggle to differentiate between reliable and unreliable sources. As a result, confusion and misinformation spread, making it difficult for individuals to make informed decisions. Furthermore, the sheer volume of information available leads to fragmented attention, where users find it hard to focus on any single topic. This scattered focus contributes to a shallow understanding of complex issues, leaving users unable to fully grasp the nuances of important subjects. Information overflow can cause a variety of problems, from increased anxiety and stress to reduced decision-making quality and difficulty in distinguishing between fact and fiction. This issue is amplified by the fact that social media platforms use algorithms designed to amplify sensational or emotionally charged content, which contributes to the flood of often misleading or manipulative information. The government's Social Media Bill aims to address the spread of misinformation and harmful content by holding social media companies responsible for removing false or misleading content. However, it overlooks the root cause of information overload-the sheer volume of daily content users face. While regulating harmful content is crucial, simply removing false information doesn't address the overwhelming flood of data users must navigate. The bill also risks over censorship. Platforms, in attempting to comply, may remove not only harmful content but also legitimate discussions, narrowing the information landscape. This could worsen information overload, as users would be exposed to fewer perspectives, limiting discourse. Additionally, the bill doesn't tackle the algorithms that amplify sensational content, further contributing to information overload. By focusing only on content removal, the bill misses the deeper issue of how algorithms sustain the problem. Without addressing these mechanisms, the bill's efforts will only partially alleviate the issue. Finally, the bill fails to address user responsibility in managing information consumption. Information overload isn't just about volume; it's also about how users filter and assess content. Without promoting media literacy and critical thinking, the bill only addresses a symptom, not the root cause. Ultimately, while the Social Media Bill is a step towards regulating online content, it misses the larger issue of information overload. A more comprehensive approach is needed to both regulate harmful content and redefine how information is curated and consumed. The Social Media Bill in Nepal, while well-intentioned, falls short in addressing the full complexity of the information overload problem. While its efforts to regulate harmful content and protect personal data are important, it does not tackle the broader issues of information quantity and algorithmic manipulation that contribute to the overwhelming flood of digital information. A more effective strategy would require a multifaceted approach, including not only content regulation but also reforms to the algorithms that shape what users see, as well as initiatives to improve media literacy and help users manage their digital consumption.","content, information, bill, the, media, platforms, overload, social, issue, users, overflow, flood, speech, theory, removal, harmful, data, consumption, consequences, or"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/social-media-bill-presented-in-national-assembly,Social Media Bill presented in National Assembly,Rastriya Samachar Samiti,2025-02-09 17:11:28,"KATHMANDU, FEBRUARY 9 The Media Council Bill, 2081 BS has been presented in the National Assembly (NA). Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung tabled the Bill in the session. Prior to this, NA Chairperson Narayan Prasad Dahal apprised the House that no notice of protest has been received regarding the Bill. The government had on January 28 registered the document in the NA, citing it aimed to further systematise the use of social sites, making them decent and secured. Tabling the Bill, the Minister said the Bill is meant for making the operators and users of social site platforms responsible and accountable and promoting social goodwill, cultural tolerance and good governance through the appropriate and systematic use of social sites. The Bill has proposed the provisions for license (with a two-year validity) for any companies, firms or institutions to operate digital platforms and renewal of the permission, granting the rights to authorities concerned to ban on the operation of such platforms and the remove the contents in violations of the terms and conditions. It has proposed conditions for the users of social sites as well. The Bill prohibiting cyber bullying, stalking and ID hacking, extortion or sextortion, dissemination of vulgar, fake or misleading contents, uploading or dissemination of deep fake videos and the use of accounts with anonymous or pseudonymous identity. The Bill has wanted that the operation of social sites should not the jeopardize the country's peace and security, order, sovereignty, territorial integrity, national security, national unity, independence and should not feature contents that are against the interests of nation. In case of the violations of these terms and conditions, the operation license may be scrapped.

China's population stood at 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year. The figures announced by the government in Beijing follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea and other nations have seen their birth rates plummet. China three years ago joined Japan and most of Eastern Europe among other nations whose population is falling. The reasons are in many cases similar: Rising costs of living are causing young people to put off or rule out marriage and childbirth while pursuing higher education and careers. While people are living longer, that's not enough to keep up with rate of new births. Countries such as China that allow very little immigration are especially at risk. China has long been among the world's most populous nations, enduring invasions, floods and other natural disasters to sustain a population that thrived on rice in the south and wheat in the north. Following the end of World War II and the Communist Party's rise to power in 1949, large families reemerged and the population doubled in just three decades, even after tens of millions died in the Great Leap Forward that sought to revolutionize agriculture and industry and the Cultural Revolution that followed a few years later. After the end of the Cultural Revolution and leader Mao Zedong's death, Communist bureaucrats began to worry the country's population was outstripping its ability to feed itself and began implementing a draconian ""one child policy."" Though it was never law, women had to apply for permission to have a child and violators could face forced late-term abortions and birth control procedures, massive fines and the prospect of their child being deprived an identification number, effectively making them non-citizens. Rural China, where the preference for male offspring was especially strong and two children were still ostensibly allowed, became the focus of government efforts, with women forced to present evidence they were menstruating and buildings emblazoned with slogans such as ""have fewer children, have better children."" The government sought to stamp out selective abortion of female children, but with abortions legal and readily available, those operating illicit sonogram machines enjoyed a thriving business. That has been the biggest factor in China's lopsided sex ratio, with as many as millions more boys born, raising the possibility of social instability among China's army of bachelors. Friday's report gave the sex imbalance as 104.34 men to every 100 women, though independent groups give the imbalance as considerably higher. More disturbing for the government was the drastically falling birthrate, with China's total population dropping for the first time in decades in 2022 and China being narrowly overtaken by India as the world's most populous nation the following year. A rapidly aging population, declining workforce, lack of consumer markets and migration abroad are putting the system under severe pressure. While spending on the military and flashy infrastructure projects continues to rise, China's already frail social security system is teetering, with increasing numbers of Chinese refusing to pay into the underfunded pension system. Already, more than one-fifth of the population is aged 60 or over, with the official figure given as 310.3 million or 22% of the total population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 30%, sparking discussion of changes to the official retirement age, which one of the lowest in the world.

The Indian Space Research Organization, or ISRO, maneuvered back together the two satellites, weighing 220 kilograms (485 pounds) each, during a ""precision"" space docking experiment, known as SpaDeX, the space agency said. It called the operation as a ""historic moment."" In December, the satellites, Chaser and Target, blasted off on a single rocket from the Sriharikota launch site. ""India docked its name in space history!"" the ISRO said in a post on social media site X. ""Post docking, control of two satellites as a single object is successful."" The mission was postponed twice earlier due to technical issues. Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Indian scientists on the successful mission. ""It is a significant stepping stone for India's ambitious space missions in the years to come,"" he said on the X platform. The successful mission, earlier achieved by only the Soviet Union, the United States and China, showcased India's rising standing as a technology and space powerhouse and dovetails with its desire to project an image of an ascendant country asserting its place among the global elite. In 2023, Modi said that India's space agency will set up an Indian-crafted space station by 2035 and land an Indian astronaut on the moon by 2040. Active in space research since the 1960s, India has launched satellites for itself and other countries, and successfully put one in orbit around Mars in 2014. After a failed attempt to land on the moon in 2019, India became the first country to land a spacecraft near the moon's south pole in 2023 in a historic voyage to uncharted territory that scientists believe could hold vital reserves of frozen water. The mission was dubbed as a technological triumph for the world's most populous nation.","space, satellites, the, mission, docking, indian, soviet, research, moon, narendra, milestone, modi, voyage, chaser, sriharikota, isro, union, astronaut, site, object"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/6th-asian-population-association-conference-milestone-for-nepals-population-and-development-policy,6th Asian Population Association Conference: Milestone for Nepal's Population and Development Policy,Prof. Dr. Yogendra B Gurung,2024-11-25 13:11:15,"The 6th Asian Population Association Conference is going to be held in Kathmandu Nepal from 27-30 November 2024. The conference will delve deeper in discussion on the current Asian population mega-trend and patterns and its future. Thanks to the APA Council that it decided to hold the 6th conference in Nepal. Central Department of Population Studies (CDPS), Tribhuvan University (TU), is the host of this conference. This is a historic as well as a golden opportunity for not only CDPS-TU but also for the country. This conference will provide a common platform for global and Asian and Nepali academia, professionals, policy makers and politicians studying and working in the field of population and development. It provides an opportunity to learning, sharing, and discussing about the contemporary population policies, population trends and patterns, and the future of the population in relation to development for human wellbeing. The conference will be organized in several parallel sessions with 17 themes related to population and development. There will be two plenary sessions specially focusing on – (1) changing realities of fertility and family in Asia and (2) emerging migration flow within the region. In addition, there will be two special sessions – (1) Advancing demographic education in Asia-Pacific region and (2) Nepal special session which includes changing population dynamics and its implication in population and development in Nepal. The Nepal session will provide inputs and feedback for upcoming population policy in the country. Organizing ""Nepal Special Session"" is the learning from 2nd APA Conference held in Thailand, Bangkok, where Thailand was able to utilize the opportunity from the conference to make their population and development policy. It was learned that the policy based on the output of the deeper discussion from national and international demographers and policy makers during the session had been a milestone for the population management in Thailand. Therefore, the Nepal Special Session is an opportunity for Nepal, and we can maximize it by learning from other's experiences and discussing current population shifts and the future of our population, replacement level fertility, internal and international migration, gender equality and women empowerment and so forth. Consequently, we will be able to prepare an evidence based practical population policy that could be a milestone for the population and management and development policy. Human population is that it is itself a resource, means and ends. Any kind of development is possible from the population, which is by the population, and ultimately for the population. Thus the population has to be at the center of development, development policies and plans as well as programs. The evidence-based development policies and plans does mean that the evidence should be the population structure that informs ""how many;"" ""who"" in terms of age, sex, and caste/ethnicity structure, and poverty level; ""where"" geographic proximity of the residence of population; and ""why"" in terms of variation and diversity of the population. It also informs future scenario population structure by its projection of what will happen in the next 25 years as for example. These analyses will give base evidence for current and futuristic policies and plans. There are a number of examples that have been published by the national newspapers time and again telling stories about the development not matched with population. For example, many schools are in the stage of closing in some parts of mountain and hill areas due to lack of students, bridges and roads have been built but they are under-utilized because people have migrated to other areas, and so on. Such realities were not envisioned when the roads, bridges, and schools were constructed. This is largely due to the decisions without analyzing the current and future population structure,possibility of migration, and employment opportunities and basic health and other services facilities that are required for the population. Also, aspiration and expectations of the people would change by time were not envisioned. Another important issue is that the population issue has not been well internalized by policy makers, planners and politicians. Consequently, it has not been well mainstreamed as well as institutionalized by the government. The current population institution has been squeezed into ""population mahasakha"" under the Ministry of Health and Population, which has several limitations for influencing the national policies and plans. This conference would be highly appropriate to learn such relationships of population with environment, climate change and development and to sensitize development professionals, policy makers, planners, government machineries, and politicians. It is also expected that sensitization with this knowledge would help the population issue would be well internalized and institutionalized in the government. According to Census 2021, Nepal has for the first time below one percent of annual population growth, which is 0.92 percent. Nepal has achieved a replacement level fertility and indicated the lowering trend in fertility, meaning that it will be lowering in the future. Population mobility both internally and internationally has been ever growing. This scenario clearly indicates that Nepal has already entered into a ""demographic mega-trend"" that has been experienced in most of the Asian countries. South Korea, Japan, China and other countries have minus population growth rate, considerably low fertility, high population mobility, growing ageing population and so on. Malaysia, Thailand and others are following these countries. Nepal is also in the same direction. China is an interesting example. It had a ""one-child"" policy in 1980 for making balance between population, resources and development. Now, it has a total fertility of 1.17 births per women and population growth rate of -0.103 and, consequently China has a new policy amended in 2021 that allows a couple to have three-child.Similarly, we will learn from the experience from Japan and South Korea how they have been addressing the ageing population, what type of policies they have. It is because Nepal also has stepped onto ""ageing society"" and we will be expectedly heading towards the same direction. Only the difference is that we are not able to achieve expected economic development, which is not matched with our current population shift. Currently India has the highest population in the World, which is 1.44 billion. Second position holds China and India surpassed the China population in April 2023. India and Nepal have a similar level of population structure, population growth and fertility. However, the difference between Nepal and India is that India is the World's most populated country, whereas Nepal has only 29.2 million. So, India's transition may be slower than that in Nepal. If we look at African countries, they have already declared that they will be attending the ""demographic windows of opportunity"" in 2068. In order to harness this opportunity, they are preparing for high investment in education and health and opening various ways of employment and income opportunities, which we never did. We can learn from the global demographic transition and change. When we compare the population shift of Nepal over the years with global demographic transition over the centuries, we could learn a lot about how to respond to the population change in short term as well as long term, and how to address the society and the development. There are some situations still lagging behind the current population change and some negative impacts of current population change. For example, maternal mortality and girl child marriage are still high. Similarly, sex ratio at birth is also high. The maternal mortality is related to lack of required facility with health services; child marriage is more towards traditional and cultural ideology; and the sex ratio at birth is an effect recent fertility decline because it was not that high in the past. When a couple wants a low number of children, they prefer to have a boy, and it is more towards a patriarchal value system. And all these raise the same issue that we still need to work more on ""gender equality and women empowerment."" All these issues will be analyzed and discussed and also sharing the experiences from different countries in various themes and sessions of the conferences. Output of this conference will be compiled in a report and used to prepare the upcoming policy so as to achieve the demographic dividend in the country. Also, it provides an opportunity to develop a practical and advanced level course for MA in Population Studies at Tribhuvan University which will be devoted to producing trained human resources in population studies/demography to support policies and programs to achieve demographic dividend. Prof. Dr. Gurung is coordinator of the National Organizing Committee of the 6th Asian Population Association Conference.","population, the, conference, policy, demographic, fertility, asian, structure, development, current, 6th, session, and, policies, special, evidence, studies, child, transition, sex"

FNNTE president Bijaya Swar said that although it was estimated that around 1.5 to 1.8 million passengers will be leaving Kathmandu Valley for their home towns for celebrating Dashain this year, less than the estimated number exited the Valley due to the disruption of roads from flooding and landslides triggered by incessant rains on September 27 and 28.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/russias-has-used-its-hypersonic-oreshnik-missile-for-the-first-time-what-are-its-capabilities,Russia's has used its hypersonic Oreshnik missile for the first time. What are its capabilities?,Associated Press,2024-12-09 11:46:54,"The silent black-and-white surveillance camera video of the Russian missile attack in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro was brief but chilling: Six huge fireballs pierced the darkness and slammed into the ground at astonishing speed. Within hours of the Nov. 21 attack on the military facility, Russian President Vladimir Putin took the rare step of speaking on national TV to boast about the new, hypersonic missile. He warned the West that its next use could be against Ukraine's NATO allies who allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Putin said the missile was called the ""Oreshnik"" - Russian for ""hazelnut tree."" A look at the weapon, how it fits into Moscow's battle plan and what political message Russia wants to send by using it: What's known about the Oreshnik? A satisfied smile played across Putin's face as he described how the Oreshnik streaks to its target at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, ""like a meteorite,"" and claimed it was immune to any missile defense system. Ukrainian military officials said it reached Mach 11. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, head of Russia's Strategic Missile Forces, said the Oreshnik could carry nuclear or conventional warheads and has a range to reach any European target. The Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia's RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. The attack marked the first time such a weapon was used in a war. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019. Ukraine's Main Intelligence Directorate said the missile had six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. Its payload of independently targetable warheads, like a cluster of hazelnuts growing on a tree, could be the inspiration for the missile's name. Video of the attack appeared to show six warheads surrounded by clouds of plasma raining down in a fiery descent. The six submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives. Putin claimed the weapon is so powerful that using several such missiles - even fitted with conventional warheads - could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. It's capable of destroying underground bunkers ""three, four or more floors down,"" he boasted, threatening to use it against the government district in Kyiv. Ukraine's Security Service showed The Associated Press wreckage of the missile -- charred, mangled wires and an ashen airframe - at Dnipro's Pivdenmash plant that built missiles when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. There were no fatalities in the attack, and authorities haven't described the damage to the plant. They said the missile was fired from the 4th Missile Test Range of Kapustin Yar in Russia's Astrakhan region on the Caspian Sea. What other missiles has Russia used? Russia has used an assortment of missiles to pummel Ukraine since the start of its invasion in February 2022, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik. They included subsonic long-range cruise missiles that carry about 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of explosives, enough to inflict a significant damage to Ukrainian power plants and other key infrastructure. The winged, jet-propelled cruise missiles have a range of up to 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles), able to reach all of Ukraine. Russia also used swarms of inexpensive, Iranian-designed drones that carry only about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of explosives. The slow-flying drones are relatively easy to intercept, but Russia used dozens of them at a time to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses and divert attention from simultaneously launched cruise missiles. For some priority targets, Russia has used faster and harder-hitting missiles, including the ground-launched Iskander short-range ballistic missile with a range of 500 kilometers (310 miles). For particularly important targets, Moscow has used the hypersonic Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile. Its high speed - able to briefly reach Mach 10 - and ability to maneuver in flight helps it evade air defenses, although Ukraine claims to have shot down a few of them. Oreshnik is even more difficult to intercept than Kinzhal. It can inflict significantly heavier damage because of its multiple high-energy warheads. What message is Putin sending with the Oreshnik? Putin described the Oreshnik as a response to the U.S. and U.K. allowing Ukraine to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory, a move he said gave ""elements of a global character"" to the conflict. ""We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,"" he said. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Putin's Security Council, said Oreshnik could reach targets in Europe within minutes, inflicting ""catastrophic"" damage. ""Bomb shelters will not save you,"" he posted on his messaging app channel. Russian state media extolled the Oreshnik, claiming it will take just 11 minutes to reach an air base in Poland and 17 minutes to reach NATO's headquarters in Brussels. T-shirts have appeared with images of Putin and the Oreshnik, and he was told at a briefing that a couple planned to name their daughter after the missile. Military expert Mathieu Boulègue of Chatham House in Britain said that while the Oreshnik isn't a game-changer on the battlefield, ""in terms of psychological warfare, it works great"" in serving the Kremlin's goal to scare a Western audience. The Nov. 21 attack came two days after Putin signed a revised version of Russia's nuclear doctrine, which lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons. The doctrine allows for a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. The use of the Oreshnik was an expression of Moscow's anger at the use of longer-range Western missiles and a signal to Ukraine and President-elect Donald Trump that Russia was going to pursue its goals, regardless of the support for Kyiv, said James J. Townsend, senior fellow at the Center for New American Security. ""This is a very powerful message being sent,"" Townsend said. ""It's showing Trump how serious Russia looks on what the Biden administration has been doing and how seriously they look on and how angry they are about this type of assistance."" Putin's warning about potential strikes on NATO assets follows calls by Russian hawks for such attacks to force Ukraine's allies to back down. Unlike other Russian conventional weapons with a shorter range, Oreshnik offers the capability to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether Oreshnik carries a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target. ""The enemy must understand that we are ready to take the most resolute steps and strike the territory of NATO members with conventional weapons first,"" said Sergei Karaganov, a political expert who advises the Kremlin. ""At the same time, we will warn them that if they respond to that attack in an escalatory way, a nuclear strike would come second, and a third wave will target American bases.""","missile, range, the, nuclear, missiles, warheads, conventional, weapons, russian, 500, attack, putin, nato, sergei, security, ukrainian, kilometers, cruise, miles, its"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/a-tiny-village-in-india-where-kamala-harris-has-ancestral-roots-is-praying-for-her-victory,A tiny village in India where Kamala Harris has ancestral roots is praying for her victory,Associated Press,2024-11-05 18:41:19,"THULASENDRAPURAM, NOVEMBER 5 The temple reverberated with rhythmic Sanskrit and Tamil hymns, as a Hindu priest held a flame before the god. As this tiny South Indian village gathered to pray for Kamala Harris, a gaggle of reporters jostled for space and camera angles. There's little to distinguish the village of Thulasendrapuram from any other rural community in Tamil Nadu, except its connection to a woman who could become America's first leader with South Asian roots. As millions of Americans vote, Harris has people rooting for her from thousands of miles away in a village surrounded by rice paddies and coconut trees, where her mother's family has ancestral ties. They talk about her at the local tea shop. Banners and billboards bearing her face are seen throughout the community. ""Our deity is a very powerful God. If we pray well to him, he will make her victorious,"" said M. Natarajan, the temple priest that led the prayers in front of the image of Hindu deity Ayyanar, a form of Lord Shiva. Harris' maternal grandfather was born in the village, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) from the southern coastal city of Chennai, more than 100 years ago. As an adult, he moved to Chennai, where he worked as a high-ranking government official until his retirement. Harris has never visited Thulasendrapuram and she has no living relatives in the village, but people here still venerate the family that made it big in the U.S. ""Our village ancestors' granddaughter is running as a U.S. presidential candidate. Her victory will be happy news for every one of us,"" Natarajan said. The village's sudden fame has helped bring money into the village. Recently, construction began on a water storage tank with funds donated by a local bank. Village residents say it will carry a plaque with Harris' name. Harris' late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born in India. After moving to the U.S. to study, she married a Jamaican man, and they named their daughter Kamala, a Sanskrit word for ""lotus flower."" Other than trips during her childhood, Harris hasn't visited India much - particularly not since becoming vice president - but she has often spoken emotionally about her ties to her late mother's country of birth. On Tuesday, she released a campaign video highlighting her mother, who arrived in the U.S. at age 19 and became a cancer researcher. Titled ""Mother,"" the video ends with a narrator saying: ""This daughter of Shyamala, this daughter of the American story, is ready to lead us forward."" Harris has often talked about how she was guided by the values of her Indian-born grandfather and mother. She has also spoken of her love of south Indian food, especially a type of steamed rice cake called idli. Harris' name is engraved in a list of donors - her aunt Sarala Gopalan gave money to the temple in her name - along with that of her grandfather. Outside, a large banner wishes ""the daughter of the land"" success in the election. On Tuesday, the village temple also received rare international visitors: two American tourists and one from the U.K., all wearing black t-shirts that said ""Kamala Freakin Harris."" Manikandan Ganesan, a villager who runs a small store near the temple, said Harris' bid for the presidency has made the village famous. He hopes Harris will eventually visit them. ""Even if she mentioned that she would visit our village, it would make us very happy,"" Ganesan said. ""Her victory itself will be a big source of happiness for us."" Village residents also prayed for Harris' victory in 2020, and set off firecrackers when she became the U.S. Vice President. For women of the village, the candidate's journey is a source of inspiration. Local politician Arulmozhi Sudhakar said Harris embodies a significant step toward female empowerment in places like Thulasendrapuram, where a majority of women continue to face discrimination and gender inequality. ""From the time when women were not even allowed to step out of their house, to now a woman from our village contesting in the U.S. presidential election - this brings happiness for us,"" Sudhakar said. ""The coming generations will see her as a role model to succeed in life.""","harris, her, village, mother, the, temple, daughter, grandfather, god, gopalan, sudhakar, arulmozhi, tamil, priest, deity, sanskrit, indian, roots, kamala, south"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/joker-is-back-this-time-with-lady-gaga-and-songs,"Joker is back, this time with Lady Gaga - and songs",Associated Press,2024-10-01 22:21:37,"VENICE, OCTOBER 1 "" Joker "" is a hard act to follow. Todd Phillips' dark, Scorsese-inspired character study about the Batman villain made over a billion dollars at the box office, won Joaquin Phoenix his first Oscar, dominated the cultural discourse for months and created a new movie landmark. It wasn't for everyone, but it got under people's skin. Knowing that it was a fool's errand to try to do it again, Phillips and Phoenix pivoted, or rather, pirouetted into what would become "" Joker: Folie à Deux."" The dark and fantastical musical journey goes deeper into the mind of Arthur Fleck as he awaits trial for murder and falls in love with a fellow Arkham inmate, Lee, played by Lady Gaga. There is singing, dancing and mayhem. If Phillips and Phoenix have learned anything over the years, it's that the scarier something is, the better. So once again they rebelled against expectations and went for broke with something that's already sharply divided critics. As with the first, audiences will get to decide for themselves when it opens in theaters on Oct. 4. ""HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET JOAQUIN PHOENIX TO DO A SEQUEL?"" Any comic book movie that makes a billion dollars is going to have the sequel talk. But with ""Joker"" it was never a given that it would go anywhere: Joaquin Phoenix doesn't do sequels. Yet it turned out, Phoenix wasn't quite done with Arthur Fleck yet either. During the first, the actor wondered what this character would look like in different situations. He and the on-set photographer mocked up classic movie posters, like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Yentl"" with the Joker in them and showed them to Phillips. ""Sometimes you're just done with something and other times you have an ongoing interest,"" Phoenix said. ""There was just more to explore. ... I just felt like we weren't done."" So Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver got to work on a new script, one that leaned into the music in Arthur Fleck's head. Then his dreary Arkham life turns to Technicolor when he meets and falls for Lee, a Joker superfan. ""Joaquin Phoenix is not going to do a line drive. He's not going to do something that's fan service,"" Phillips said. ""He wanted to be as scared as he was with the first movie. So, we tried to make something that is as audacious and out there and hopefully people get it."" LADY GAGA FINDS LEE'S VOICE, AND LOSES HER OWN One decision that's already sparking debate is casting someone with a voice like Lady Gaga's and not using that instrument to its full power. Phillips, who was a producer on ""A Star is Born,"" wanted someone who ""brought music with them."" But Lee isn't a singer. ""Singing is so second nature to me, and making music and performing on stage is so inside of me. Especially this music,"" Gaga said. ""I worked extensively on untraining myself for this movie and throwing away as much as I could all the time to make sure I was never locking into what I do. I had to really kind of erase it all."" Phoenix, who wasn't quite sure what it would be like working with someone who has such a larger-than-life superstar persona, found Gaga to be refreshingly unpretentious and available. And as an actor, he admired her commitment to the character. ""Her power is in singing and singing a particular way,"" he said. ""For her to sacrifice that through character, to do something that people would call a musical, but to not be performing it in the way that would sound best as a singer but to approach it from the character was a very difficult process. I was really impressed with her willingness to do that."" In addition to writing a ""waltz that falls apart"" for the film, Gaga is releasing a companion album, ""Harlequin"" on Friday with song titles including ""Oh, When the Saints,"" ""World on a String,"" ""If My Friends Could See Me Now"" and ""That's Life."" SORRY PUDDIN', THIS AIN'T MARGOT ROBBIE'S HARLEY QUINN Much like Phoenix's Joker isn't Heath Ledger's or Jack Nicholson's, Gaga's Lee is not the Harley Quinn of ""Birds of Prey."" ""We're never going to outdo what Margot Robbie did,"" Phillips said. ""You have to do something 180 degrees in the other direction."" Sure, Lee will still casually light something on fire to get some time alone with Joker, but the tumult is more internal. And Gaga threw herself into making Lee something new: A real person, grounded in a reality that came before her. ""I spent a lot of my time on developing her inner life (which) for me had a lot to do with her storm and what thing was always making her about to explode,"" Gaga said. ""There's a particular kind of danger that she carries with her, but it's inside and it's kind of explosive."" ""DO YOU JUST WANT A BRUTE?"" Brendan Gleeson didn't have much hesitation about joining the ensemble. He'd worked with Phoenix before on ""The Village"" and was in awe of what he'd done on the first movie. ""He has an absolute relentless integrity and curiosity and drive,"" Gleeson said. ""He won't just plough the same furrow for its own sake."" But he also didn't want to play the simple version of an Arkham prison guard. ""I said, look, do you just want a brute? Because I'm not sure I just want to do a brute,"" Gleeson said. ""He wanted something more. We tried to find layers in this guy."" CREATING MAYHEM Anyone who has worked with Phoenix knows that he likes to keep things fresh. That may mean something as small as changing the location of a prop or as big as throwing out choreography that you've been rehearsing for months at the last minute. ""I think we both love mayhem and not just in movies but on the set,"" Phillips said. ""It had to feel like anything can happen."" With the crew 95% the same as the first, everyone was ready to be flexible. Gaga, too, dove right in, suggesting that they sing live on camera. ""It changed the whole making of the film,"" Phillips said. ""We were not only singing live, we were singing live differently every take."" THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT? Since Arthur killed Robert De Niro's talk show host Murray Franklin on live television in the first film, he's become a kind of icon and curiosity thanks in no small part to an oft referenced, but never seen, television movie that was made about him. Now, the trial is going to be televised as well. ""Underneath it all, there's this idea of corruption and how everything is corrupt in the system, from the prison system to the judicial system to the idea of entertainment, quite frankly,"" Phillips said. ""This idea that in the States at least, everything is entertainment. A court trial could be entertainment, and a presidential election can be entertainment. So, if that's true, what is entertainment?"" NO LONGER A COMPLETE WILD CARD It's easier to be to the insurgent, not the incumbent, Phillips said. Although a Joker film is never going to fly completely under the radar, the spotlight is undoubtedly more intense this time around. ""You do feel like you have a larger target on your back,"" Phillips said. While much of the film was made on Warner Bros. soundstages in Los Angeles, the production did go back to New York to film again on the Bronx staircase (which now come up on Google Maps as the Joker Stairs) and outside a Manhattan courthouse. The production staged a massive protest scene, with Gaga, almost concurrently with the media frenzy around the Donald Trump hush money trial as if there weren't enough eyes on them already. Some are also handwringing about the sequel's bigger budget and whether it can match the success of the first. But Phillips has learned to take it in stride. ""There's a different amount of pressure, but that just comes with making movies,"" he said. ""You can't please everybody and you just kind of go for it."" Gleeson has an even sunnier outlook. ""It has kind of arthouse movie integrity on a blockbuster scale. It's great news for cinema, is the way I look on it,"" Gleeson said. ""If these event movies can continue to have depth and can be so conflicting like this one, is we needn't worry about the future of cinema."" SO, IS IT A MUSICAL? One thing Phillips didn't mean to do was ignite a discourse about what is and isn't a musical. He's just trying to manage expectations. ""People go, 'what do you mean it's not a musical?' And it is a musical. It has all the elements of a musical. But I guess what I mean by it is all the musicals I've seen leave me happy at the end for the most part, 'Umbrellas of Cherbourg' not being one of them. This has so much sadness in it that I just didn't want to be misleading to people.""","the, joker, gaga, movie, sequel, margot, robbie, phoenix, lady, harley, joaquin, arthur, fleck, arkham, brute, her, lee, trial, voice, character"

Director Kiran Rao's critically acclaimed ""Laapataa Ladies"" - renamed ""Lost Ladies"" for its Oscar campaign - emerged as the biggest winner at the 2025 IIFA Awards, bagging 10 wins, including best picture and best direction. The 2023 comedy is about two veiled brides who are accidentally swapped during a train ride, and tackles issues of patriarchy and gender roles, a shift from decades of male-centered mainstream Indian movies. ""It's a rare privilege to win an award for a film like 'Laapataa Ladies.' It's been a wonderful night. It's a rare privilege to make a film like this,"" Rao said in her acceptance speech. Rao's film - a rare departure from most Bollywood films, which typically feature song-and-dance routines, violence and melodrama - also won in categories for best story, best screenplay and best actress in a leading role. The annual ceremony of IIFA began in the western city of Jaipur on Saturday and concluded Sunday. Indian cinema's most recognizable names took part in the glitzy event and Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and actor Shahid Kapoor were among those who performed at the ceremony. The event was hosted by veteran director and producer Karan Johar and actor Kartik Aaryan. The awards show also presents an opportunity for Indian celebrities to showcase their fashion, and this year was no exception. Notable figures such as Madhuri Dixit, Katrina Kaif and Kareena Kapoor Khan displayed their fashion choices on the green carpet.","ladies, film, awards, kapoor, rao, bollywood, aaryan, laapataa, rukh, johar, best, khan, shahid, kartik, indian, lost, karan, oscar, kiran, actor"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sean-baker-wins-best-director-oscar-for-anora-in-academy-awards-sweep,Sean Baker wins best director Oscar for 'Anora' in Academy Awards sweep,Associated Press,2025-03-03 12:06:35,"LOS ANGELES, MARCH 3 ""Anora"" creator Sean Baker won best director, best picture and two other Academy Awards at the Oscars on Sunday, bookending a dominant awards season for the American filmmaker whose stories seek to humanize sex workers and immigrants. Baker, 53, wrote, produced, directed and edited the most dominant film of the night. The comedy-drama stars Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the impetuous son of a Russian oligarch. They impulsively tie the knot on a ketamine-induced Las Vegas getaway, angering his parents, who send their bumbling henchmen after the couple to force an annulment. ""Anora"" swept on Sunday with five overall wins - two more than ""The Brutalist."" Four of those statues went to Baker, who now ties Walt Disney for the most wins in a single year in Academy Awards history. (Unlike Disney in 1954, all Baker's wins were for a single project. Bong Joon Ho was the previous record holder for most wins for a single film, in 2020 for ""Parasite."") In addition to best director and best picture, Baker won for best original screenplay and best editing - a rarity as directors don't typically cut their own films. He came into the night the favorite for the directing Oscar after earning the top prize from the Directors Guild of America, a win that historically all but guarantees an Oscars victory. He also took home the top awards at the Producers Guild and Independent Spirit Awards. In his best director acceptance speech, he exhorted filmmakers to keep creating projects for the big screen, bemoaning the erosion of the theatergoing experience. ""In a time in which the world can feel very divided, this is more important than ever,"" Baker said. ""It's a communal experience you simply don't get at home. If we don't reverse this trend, we'll be losing a vital part of our culture. This is my battle cry."" Baker told Quentin Tarantino, who presented the award, that if he hadn't cast Madison in 2019's ""Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,"" there would be no ""Anora."" On Sunday, Madison took home the lead actress award - her first Oscar. ""Thank you so much to Sean. I adore you. This is all because of you,"" Madison said onstage. This year's best director lineup featured five first-time nominees in the category for the first time in nearly three decades. All had writing credits on their respective films, demonstrating the academy's growing preference for auteurs who can masterfully bring their own vision to life. For the Oscar, Baker beat out Brady Corbet of ""The Brutalist,"" James Mangold of ""A Complete Unknown,"" Jacques Audiard of ""Emilia Pérez"" and Coralie Fargeat of ""The Substance."" ""Anora"" brings Baker's signature style of provocative comedy from indie theaters into the mainstream, blending slapstick humor with social commentary in a way that makes lessons about marginalized groups palatable to a wider audience. He made the film on a modest budget of $6 million - an amount one producer previously joked is smaller than the catering budget of some of its competitors. He said Sunday that it was the best $6 million ever spent. Last year's best picture winner, ""Oppenheimer,"" had a $100 million budget. Baker has been vocal about the difficulty of making independent films and surviving as an indie filmmaker in an industry that increasingly supports big-budget spectacles. In a rousing speech at the Independent Spirit Awards, he said indies are in danger of becoming ""calling card films"" - movies made only as a means to get hired for projects at major studios. Without backing for independent films, he said, some of the most creative and innovative projects might never be made. He said he hopes the success of ""Anora"" will increase support for indie projects. Baker has long been passionate about using his craft to help destigmatize sex work. His 2012 film ""Starlet"" follows a budding friendship between an adult film star and a crotchety widow who sells her a thermos full of cash at a yard sale. Baker said the connections he formed with sex workers involved in the project inspired him to feature them in several other films. He received widespread praise for ""Tangerine"" (2015), in which he used three iPhone 5S smartphones to tell a story about transgender sex workers in Los Angeles. In ""The Florida Project"" (2017), a single mother living in an Orlando motel turns to sex work to provide for her daughter. And ""Red Rocket"" (2021) follows a retired porn actor's journey back to his small Texas hometown. Baker and Madison weren't the only ones to pick up Oscars for ""Anora"" - producers Alex Coco and Samantha Quan, Baker's wife, also received statues for the best picture win.","awards, the, baker, best, films, guild, academy, oscar, film, directors, anora, producers, project, budget, wins, sex, audiard, picture, angeles, los"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/strip-club-cinderella-story-anora-wins-best-picture-at-97th-academy-awards,Strip club Cinderella story 'Anora' wins best picture at 97th Academy Awards,Associated Press,2025-03-03 10:09:44,"LOS ANGELES, MARCH 3 ""Anora,"" a strip club Cinderella story without the fairy tale ending, was crowned best picture at the 97th Academy Awards on Sunday, handing Sean Baker's gritty, Brooklyn-set screwball farce Hollywood's top prize. In a stubbornly fluctuating Oscar season, ""Anora,"" the Palme d'Or-winner at the Cannes Film Festival, emerged as the unlikely frontrunner. Baker's tale of an erotic dancer who elopes with the son of a Russian oligarch – unusually explicit for a best-picture winner – was made for just $6 million. But Oscar voters, eschewing blockbuster contenders like ""Wicked"" and ""Dune: Part Two,"" instead added ""Anora"" to a string of recent indie best picture winners, including ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" ""CODA"" and ""Nomadland."" For a film industry that's been transformed by streaming and humbled by economic turmoil, Baker and ""Anora"" epitomized a kind of cinematic purity. On the campaign trail, Baker called for the return to the 90-day exclusive theatrical release. ""Where did we fall in love with the movies? At the movie theater,"" Baker said Sunday. ""Filmmakers, keep making films for the big screen."" In personally winning four Oscars on Sunday, Baker tied the mark held by Walt Disney, who won for four different films in 1954. That Baker and Disney share the record is ironic; his ""The Florida Project"" took place in a low-budget motel in the shadow of Disney World. ""Long live independent film!"" shouted Baker from the Dolby Theatre stage. Eight of the 10 movies nominated for best picture came away with at least one award at the Dolby Theatre on Sunday, in a ceremony that saw the acting wins go to Madison, Adrien Brody, Kieran Culkin and Zoe Saldaña. Twenty-two years after winning best actor for ""The Pianist,"" Brody won the same Oscar again for his performance as another Holocaust survivor in Brady Corbet's ""The Brutalist. His win came over Timothée Chalamet (""A Complete Unknown""), who had the chance of becoming the youngest best actor ever, a record owned by Brody. ""I'm here once again to represent the lingering traumas and the repercussions of war and systematic oppression and of antisemitism and racism and othering,"" said Brody. ""I pray for a healthier and happier and more inclusive world. If the past can teach us anything it's to not let hate go unchecked."" Madison won best actress for her breakthrough performance in ""Anora,"" a victory that came over the category favorite, Demi Moore (""The Substance""). Both she and Baker spoke, as they did at the Cannes Film Festival where ""Anora"" won the Palme d'Or, about honoring the lives of sex workers. Netflix's beleaguered contender ""Emilia Pérez,"" the lead nominee going into the show, weathered the scandal caused by offensive tweets by star Karla Sofía Gascón, to pick up awards for best song and best supporting actress, for Saldaña. ""I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hard-working hands,"" said Saldaña. ""I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award, and I know I will not be the last."" An expected win and an upset The night's first award, presented by Robert Downey Jr., went to Kieran Culkin for best supporting actor. Culkin has cruised through the season, picking up award after award, for his performance alongside Jesse Eisenberg in ""A Real Pain."" ""I have no idea how I got here,"" said Culkin, ""I've just been acting my whole life."" Culkin spent most of his speech recalling an earlier, hypothetical promise from his wife Jazz Charton, that they could have a fourth child if he won an Oscar. Culkin used the opportunity to take Charton - ""love of my life, ye of little faith"" - up on the offer. The biggest upset early on came in the best animated feature category. ""Flow,"" the wordless Latvian film upset DreamWorks Animations' ""The Wild Robot."" The win for ""Flow,"" an ecological parable about a cat in a flooded world, was the first Oscar ever for a Latvian film. ""Thank you to my cats and dogs,"" director Gints Zilbalodis accepting the award. 'Wicked' wins two ""Wicked"" stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo kicked off the ceremony with a tribute to Los Angeles following the wildfires that devastated the Southern California metropolis earlier this year. Grande sang ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and Erivo performed Diana Ross' ""Home"" before the ""Wicked"" stars joined together for ""Defying Gravity"" from their blockbuster big-screen musical. Later, ""Wicked,"" the biggest box-office hit among the best-picture nominees, won awards for production design and costume design. ""I'm the first Black man to receive the costume design award,"" said costume designer Paul Tazewell, who couldn't finish that sentence before the crowd began to rise in a standing ovation. ""I'm so proud of this."" Best makeup and hairstyling went to ""The Substance"" for its gory creations of beauty and body horror. ""Dune: Part Two"" won for both visual effects and sound, and its sandworm - arguably the star of the night - figured into multiple gags throughout the evening. Brady Corbet's sprawling postwar epic ""The Brutalist,"" shot in VistaVision, won for its cinematography, by Lol Crawley, and its score, by Daniel Blumberg. Politics go unmentioned, at first Though the Oscars featured the first time an actor was nominated for portraying a sitting U.S. president (Sebastian Stan as a young Donald Trump in ""The Apprentice""), politics went largely unmentioned in the first half of the ceremony. The president's name was never uttered during the nearly four-hour ceremony. While the show featured several striking political moments, much of this year's Oscars was more dedicated to considering the fluctuating place of movies in today's culture, and in Los Angeles' resilience following the devastating wildfires of January. Host Conan O'Brien avoided politics completely in his opening monologue. The first exception was nearly two hours in, when presenter Daryl Hannah announced simply: ""Slava Ukraini"" (""Glory to Ukraine!"") ""No Other Land,"" a documentary about Israeli occupation of the West Bank made by a collation of Palestinian and Israeli filmmakers, won best documentary. After failing to find a U.S. distributor, the filmmakers opted to self-distribute ""No Other Land."" It grossed more than any other documentary nominee. ""There is a different path, a political solution, without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both our people,"" said Yuval Abraham, an Israeili, speaking beside co-director Basel Adra, a Palestinian. ""And I have to say, as I am here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path. Why? Can't you see that we are intertwined, that my people can't be truly safe if Basel's people aren't truly free? Walter Salles' ""I'm Still Here,"" a portrait of resistance under the Brazilian military dictatorship, won best international film. At one point, that award seemed a lock for ""Emilia Pérez,"" the lead nominee with 13 nods and backed by a robust campaign by Netflix. But while ""Emilia Pérez"" collapsed, ""I'm Still Here"" rode a wave of passionate support in Brazil and political timeliness elsewhere. O'Brien scores in opening O'Brien, introduced as ""four-time Oscar viewer,"" opened the ceremony with genial ribbing of the nominees and the former talk-show host's trademark self-deprecation. ""'A Complete Unknown.' 'A Real Pain.' 'Nosferatu.' These are just some of the names I was called on the red carpet,"" said O'Brien. O'Brien, hosting for the first time, avoided any political commentary in his opening remarks, but the monologue was a smash hit. O'Brien lent on the disappointed face of John Lithgow, a full-throated ""Chalamet!"" from Adam Sandler and a gag of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos being delivered to the red carpet in a cardboard box. O'Brien's most sincere comments were reserved for Los Angeles, itself, in speaking about the enduring ""magic and grandeur"" of film in wake of the wildfires. O'Brien, whose house in the Pacific Palisades was spared by the fires, then segued into a musical routine, singing: ""I won't waste time."" An unpredictable Oscar year This year's Oscars, among the most unpredictable in years, unspooled after a turbulent year for the film industry. Ticket sales were down 3% from the previous year and more significantly from pre-pandemic times. The strikes of 2023 played havoc with release schedules in 2024. Many studios pulled back on production, leaving many out of work. The fires, in January, only added to the pain. Last year's telecast, propelled by the twin blockbusters of ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie,"" led the Oscars to a four-year viewership high, with 19.5 million viewers. This year, with smaller independent films favored in the most prominent awards, the academy will be tested to draw as large of an audience. The ceremony took place days following the death of Gene Hackman. The 95-year-old two-time Oscar winner and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead Wednesday at their New Mexico home. Morgan Freeman, his co-star in ""Unforgiven"" and ""Under Suspicion,"" honored him. ""This week, our community lost a giant,"" said Freeman, ""and I lost a dear friend.""","the, best, oscar, award, brien, film, academy, los, angeles, year, oscars, awards, basel, dolby, corbet, costume, pain, picture, brady, brutalist"

The event, organized by the Okhaldhunga Tourism Development Committee and supported by the Khijidemba Rural Municipality, is designed to promote eco-tourism, community engagement, and healthy living through adventure sports. The event will covering the scenic trails around Khijidemba, Pikey Peak, and Tholedemba Ridge-the highest hill in the Okhaldhunga District and a destination proudly listed among Nepal Government's Top 100 Tourism Destinations-the event promises panoramic vistas of Everest, Makalu, and the mid-hill landscapes. ""The 360-degree views from Pikey Peak and Tholedemba Ridge will enthrall visitors,"" said Ngawa Ngima Sherpa, President of the Okhaldhunga Tourism Development Committee. The committee has previously organized a 42-km full marathon for five consecutive years. While the marathon brought some exposure to the region, Sherpa noted it did not fully showcase the area's unique advantages. ""This year, we decided to highlight the region more comprehensively through mountain biking, under the theme 'Save the Mountain. Preserve the Environment. Inspire Humanity,'"" Sherpa added. Though less frequented than Nepal's popular trekking routes, the region offers stunning Himalayan views, rich biodiversity, and vibrant cultural experiences. It is home to diverse communities including the Sherpa, Tamang, Sunuwar, and Brahmin peoples. Riders will pass through ancient monasteries, rhododendron forests, and remote villages-experiencing authentic local hospitality, the organisers said. The four-day festival will begin on May 1 with a bus ride from Kathmandu to Khijidemba. On May 2, participants will embark on an uphill biking journey from Khijidemba (2,350 metres) to Pikey Base Camp (3,850 metres). The following day, May 3, the riders will ascend to Pikey Peak (4,065 metres) and then make a downhill return to Khijidemba. The event will conclude on May 4 with the return trip to Kathmandu. The 74-km trail, adapted from existing trekking routes, offers sunrise views, Himalayan flora and fauna, and deep cultural immersion, said Gambu Sherpa, Chairperson of Khijidemba Rural Municipality. Organizers have confirmed that while the event poses minimal health concerns due to the moderate elevation, a full team of first aid workers will be present throughout as a precautionary measure. They have extended an open invitation to professional cyclists, travel photographers, and nature lovers alike, hoping to draw attention to this spectacular yet underappreciated part of Nepal. The registration package, priced at Rs 3,500 per participant, includes round-trip transportation between Kathmandu and Khijidemba, accommodation, meals, and an official event T-shirt. The event has already attracted significant interest, with 50 participants registered ahead of the deadline. The participants include a diverse international mix, with riders from Korea, India, and Nepal. ""We initially anticipated around 60 participants, and we're thrilled with the strong early response,"" Sherpa said. For registration and further details, interested participants can contact Ngawa Ngima Sherpa at 9851166145 or Prayash Tamang at 9851032248. Inquiries can also be made through the Tourism Office in Okhaldhunga or via email at info@soraadventure.com, the organisers informed.","pikey, khijidemba, biking, the, may, mountain, participants, tourism, metres, km, tholedemba, views, ridge, okhaldhunga, tour, lower, riders, region, sherpa, marathon"

According to Sagarmatha National Park, 12,003 visitors entered the area during Chaitra (mid-March to mid-April), making it the highest monthly total so far this fiscal year. The season is ideal for mountaineering, trekking, and Himalayan sightseeing, drawing both domestic and international tourists, according to the park's ranger Bibek Shrestha. The increase in footfall has boosted business in Khumbu, with hotels from Lukla to Namche operating at full capacity. While most tourists fly to Lukla, poor weather conditions have led many to opt for overland travel via Salleri and Surke. Road expansion in recent years has provided a reliable alternative to air travel, especially during flight disruptions. Sagarmatha National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979, spans 1,148 sq km and ranges in elevation from 1,800 to 8,848 meters. It is home to Mt Everest, rich biodiversity, and significant Sherpa cultural heritage. Over the first nine months of the fiscal year, 44,608 tourists visited the park, generating more than Rs 113 million in revenue. Of them, 37,796 were foreigners and 5,897 were Nepali.","heritage, park, unesco, bibek, everest, onset, tourists, april, tourist, fiscal, sightseeing, 848, 608, overland, meters, travel, influx, 003, 12, site"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/ongoing-frustrations-of-the-nepalese-parties-playing-puppetry-with-the-country,Ongoing frustrations of the Nepalese: Parties playing puppetry with the country,Aaryan Kunwar,2025-04-07 10:51:29,"Throughout the years we have seen but little development in our country. Nepal contemporarily possesses issues such as economic hardship, political instability, human rights violations, gender inequality, a perpetuating migration crisis and the consistent fear of natural disasters. Corruption has been rampant in the country throughout the decades, which has impeded the country's ability to develop. Corruption has infiltrated all levels of the government, businesses and societies, sparking rage in innocent citizens. Political connections and bribes are deemed necessary when attempting to secure a job, access public services, or to obtain basic permits. There have been several scandals that have exposed misconduct of power; however, since these powerful figures often possess political protectionism, there are no repercussions. Economically, Nepal is in a detrimental state. Of its population, 20.1 per cent is multidimensionally poor, according to the Multidimensional Poverty Index 2024, meaning that they are deprived of the key aspects of life, including health, education and standard of living. As political leaders squabble over power, Nepalese citizens are forced to seek employment abroad due to the lack of opportunities in the country, resulting in 5.6 million Nepalis with work permits abroad and contributing about 25 per cent of the nation's GDP through remittance. Followingly, even when these migrant workers go abroad, especially in the Gulf countries, they suffer furthermore with low wages, physical and mental abuse, perpetuating exploitation. Despite the tragic deaths of thousands of migrant workers, there hasn't been improved protection of labour rights to protect the individuals who contribute to one-fourth of the nation's GDP. In fact, the emotional toll for the families left behind is substantial, particularly in rural areas where remittance is essential for survival. Migrant labour has become both the lifeline and the greatest tragedy of our economy. Even in 2025, gender inequality remains a significant issue in Nepal, particularly deriving from traditional and societal expectations that present absurd ideas for women. Gender-based violence persists substantially, with the Ministry of Health reporting in 2017 that 23 per cent of all women have experienced physical violence. The future of young girls in the country is stolen and buried in a wedding dress, as 35 per cent of Nepalese girls marry before the age of 18, robbing them of an education and their independence. Female migrant workers have been reported to face higher risks of physical, sexual and verbal violence with little to no protection. Compounded discrimination is faced by women who are Dalits, resulting in their opportunities to be restricted by gender and caste. Nepal is the land that boasts of being the birthplace of Goddess Sita, however it continues to deny its daughters the very rights and opportunities they deserve. Chronic instability has plagued the political landscape of Nepal coupled with corruption and inefficiency. The country has had 14 different prime ministers in the past 16 years, which has only stalled policy reforms and progress. Political parties are prioritising acquiring power instead of the goodwill of the country, which has caused pressing issues such as unemployment and infrastructure development to perpetuate. The public disillusionment of Nepal's democratic institution stems from these political events. In rural areas of Nepal, pregnant women have suffered through uterine rupture because they had to travel three hours to fetch water due to lack of resources in their villages. The access to clean drinking water is limited for many communities in Nepal, exposing them to waterborne diseases. Only 27 per cent of the population have access to basic sanitation, leaving the rest vulnerable. Air pollution is the worst it has ever been in Kathmandu due to local sources such as vehicle emissions, construction and the burning of agricultural waste. Some 50,000 people pass away each year in Nepal due to major health risks such as chronic lung diseases, heart disease, strokes and respiratory infections. Studies have shown that the life expectancy is decreasing in Nepal by approximately five years due to air pollution. The current situation is detrimental to the point that Kathmandu's air quality has been rated as being among the worst in the world. People do not wear masks to avoid the dust in Kathmandu, they do to survive. Flooding has been a recurrent issue in Nepal as well, with the most recent case from September 2024 causing one of the most devastating floods and landslides ever. Over 246 people died, and more than 10,000 households were left displaced. Floods caused damage to roads, bridges and schools. The rivers, such as the Bagmati and Saptakoshi, were overflowing, with a staggering 240mm of rain recorded in a span of 24 hours. Rapid urbanisation through poor planning and careless deforestation exacerbated the issues. The destruction of natural water management systems also catalyzed the effects. Informal settlements near the river were hit the harshest due to lack of necessary infrastructure and protections to cope. The tip of the iceberg has only been discussed in this article regarding the frustrations of Nepalese people. However, the current economic and political landscape leaves little optimism for the future. When we have continually faced these problems with little to no change each year, why would we not grow frustrated as political parties play puppetry with the country? All it takes to comprehend the frustrations of the citizens is to walk through Tribhuvan International Airport to see the thousands of faces of men and women who have lost faith in the future of their country, as they seek a future that their homeland failed to offer.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/what-does-the-ceasefire-agreement-mean-for-israel-hamas-and-the-wider-middle-east,"What does the ceasefire agreement mean for Israel, Hamas and the wider Middle East?",Associated Press,2025-01-16 21:42:49,"BEIRUT, JANUARY 16 Mediators said Israel and Hamas have agreed to pause the fighting in Gaza starting Sunday after 15 months of war and to begin exchanging dozens of hostages held there for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had yet to confirm on Tuesday that the deal had been finalized. But the ceasefire could eventually bring an end to the bloodiest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas, one that transformed the wider region and leaves the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the heart of the turmoil unresolved. Israel struck major blows, but 'total victory' still appears elusive Israel can point to countless tactical victories in the war, from the assassination of top Hamas leaders to the blows it rained on Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iran itself, which backs both groups. But Israel fell short on two central aims: Hamas to date has survived, even if greatly weakened, and several hostages taken captive during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack died in captivity. Some were accidentally killed by Israeli forces, others by their Hamas captors as troops closed in. Israelis see the return of captives as a sacred obligation, worth the agonizing price of releasing large numbers of imprisoned militants in lopsided deals. The inability to reach a deal through months of negotiations tore the country apart. Netanyahu, who promised ""total victory"" and the return of all the captives, faced mass protests as critics, including some hostage families, accused him of putting his political interests ahead of quickly getting them back, allegations he vehemently denied. The military campaign meanwhile sparked a global outcry, with the International Court of Justice considering allegations of genocide and the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his former defense minister and a top Hamas commander, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Israel adamantly denies such allegations, saying it takes every measure to spare civilians and blaming Hamas for their deaths because militants fight in dense residential areas. Hamas survives, for now, in a ruined Gaza Hamas said the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war was aimed at returning the Palestinian cause to the forefront of the international agenda, punishing Israel for its actions in the occupied territories and freeing Palestinian prisoners. It succeeded in drawing the world's attention, but at a catastrophic cost to Palestinians themselves, with entire families wiped out, cities in ruins and dreams of statehood more distant than ever. Over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were combatants. The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Much of Gaza now appears uninhabitable, with bombed-out buildings and mounds of rubble stretching as far as the eye can see. Around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people has been displaced, and hundreds of thousands are struggling with hunger and disease in squalid tent camps on the coast, according to United Nations officials. Most of Hamas' top leaders in Gaza and scores of mid-level commanders have been killed. Its arsenal of rockets appears to have been vastly depleted, and several of its tunnel networks have been demolished. But it remains the dominant force on the ground and is still carrying out deadly attacks on Israeli troops. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week Hamas has recruited nearly as many fighters as it has lost. Netanyahu faces new challenges and a possible reckoning Israel's ultimate political survivor managed to stay in office and stave off public inquiries after presiding over the worst security and intelligence failure in the country's history. That's because Netanyahu's narrow coalition stuck by him, insisting that politics take a back seat to crushing Hamas. But his far-right allies have threatened to bring down the government over the release of Palestinian prisoners convicted in deadly attacks on Israelis. Even if they don't bolt immediately, his position will be less secure than it was when bombs were falling on Gaza. Netanyahu also would be unable to cite the ongoing war as a reason to postpone a public inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack that could fault his leadership. But no one is yet writing off Israel's longest-serving leader. That's because Donald Trump is returning to the White House surrounded by aides who support Netanyahu's aim of expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank and potentially annexing it. That could help Netanyahu rally Israel's dominant nationalist right to his side, keeping him in power at least until elections scheduled for 2026. No plan for postwar Gaza It appears that Hamas isn't going anywhere either. It may even see its popularity grow after surviving the war and securing the release of prisoners. The militant group founded in the late 1980s is deeply enmeshed in Palestinian society, with a strong presence in the occupied West Bank and refugee camps in Lebanon. And in Gaza, there is no alternative. The Biden administration rallied its regional allies behind ambitious postwar plans for a reformed Palestinian Authority to govern and rebuild Gaza with the help of Arab and Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, which the White House hopes will take the historic step of normalizing ties with Israel. But those countries have conditioned their assistance on a pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war. That's a nonstarter for Netanyahu's government, which is opposed to Palestinian statehood. Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control and partner with politically independent Palestinians to govern Gaza - but none is likely to volunteer, as Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with such a plan. With Hamas still in control of much of the territory, Israel and Egypt are unlikely to lift the blockade they imposed when it took power in 2007. A United Nations body has calculated that if the blockade remains in place, it could take 350 years to rebuild Gaza. A headache for Biden, a triumph for Trump The war sparked worldwide protests and soaring tensions on U.S. college campuses, dividing the Democratic Party and contributing to Trump's election in November. Israel's supporters praised President Joe Biden for standing by an ally in its time of need, while critics accused him of kowtowing to Netanyahu and facilitating war crimes by flooding Israel with arms. Trump, on the other hand, can argue he delivered on his promise to end the wars in the Middle East even before his inauguration. His Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, joined the negotiations on their home stretch, saying Trump's election had galvanized the process, while the Biden administration says the agreement is the fruit of its intensive efforts over several months. Any broader peace in the Middle East remains elusive, and the incoming administration will be charged with shepherding the ceasefire through subsequent - and more difficult - phases. Trump will also have to decide how far he wants to go in backing Netanyahu's drive to annex the West Bank and how to confront a weakened but defiant Iran and its regional allies. And a ceasefire does nothing to address the underlying conflict that spawned the war. The occupied West Bank has seen a surge of violence and a major expansion of Israeli settlements in recent years. In east Jerusalem, a tense arrangement governing a holy site sacred to Jews and Muslims - for which Hamas named the Oct. 7 attack - has steadily eroded. The latest war in Gaza was by far the worst, and it may not be the last.","the, palestinian, netanyahu, israeli, war, hamas, east, bank, ceasefire, biden, israel, west, occupied, his, court, mideast, blows, gaza, trump, international"

The ministry said a total of 46,006 Palestinians have been killed and 109,378 wounded. It has said women and children make up more than half the fatalities, but does not say how many of the dead were fighters or civilians. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. It says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths because the militants operate in residential areas. Israel has also repeatedly struck what it claims are militants hiding in shelters and hospitals, often killing women and children. In recent weeks, Israel and Hamas have appeared to inch closer to an agreement for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week that a deal is ""very close"" and he hopes to complete it before handing over U.S diplomacy to the incoming Trump administration. But he and other U.S. officials have expressed similar optimism on several occasions over the past year, only to see the indirect talks stall. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza. Israeli authorities believe at least a third of them were killed in the initial attack or have died in captivity. The war has flattened large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its 2.3 million people, with many forced to flee multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into sprawling tent camps along the coast with limited access to food and other essentials. ""What we are living is not a life. Nobody could bear the situation we're experiencing for a single day,"" Munawar al-Bik, a displaced woman, told The Associated Press in an interview this week. ""We wake up at night to the sounds of men crying, because of the bad situation,"" she said. ""The situation is unbearable. We have no energy left: we want it to end today."" Al-Bik spoke on a dusty road in the southern city of Khan Younis next to a destroyed building. Behind her, a sea of makeshift tents filled with displaced families stretched into the distance. On Thursday, dozens of people took part in funeral prayers outside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah for people killed in Israeli strikes the day before. In the hospital morgue, a man could be seen kneeling and bidding farewell to a relative before slamming a refrigerator door in an outburst of grief. Palestinian health officials said Israeli airstrikes killed at least nine people in Gaza on Wednesday, including three infants - among them a 1-week-old baby - and two women.","balah, al, israeli, the, deir, bik, militants, 46, ministry, situation, health, hospital, palestinians, munawar, refrigerator, infants, 006, gaza, sounds, hamas"

Russia's Delfa Dolphin Rescue and Research Center said the deaths are ""most likely related to the fuel oil spill."" The center said on the messaging app Telegram that a total of 61 dead cetaceans - an order of aquatic mammals that includes whales and dolphins - had been recorded since the emergency, but the condition of the bodies suggested that the 29 others had died before the spill. ""Judging by the condition of the bodies, most likely the majority of these cetaceans died in the first 10 days after the disaster. And now the sea continues to wash them up,"" the center wrote, noting that most of the dead dolphins were from the endangered Azov species. Russia's Emergencies Ministry said Sunday that over 96,000 tons of contaminated sand and soil had been removed by officials and volunteers along the shoreline of the Krasnodar region's Anapa and Temryuk districts. Russia-appointed officials in Moscow-occupied Crimea announced a regional emergency on Saturday after oil was detected on the shores of Sevastopol, the peninsula's largest city some 250 kilometers (155 miles) from the Kerch Strait. On Dec. 23, the ministry estimated that up to 200,000 tons in total may have been contaminated with mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the oil spill an ""ecological disaster."" The Kerch Strait is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, described the oil spill last month as a ""large-scale environmental disaster"" and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers.","peninsula, spill, strait, the, russia, oil, dolphins, center, sea, rescue, delfa, cetaceans, krasnodar, dolphin, tankers, kerch, crimean, emergencies, disaster, ministry"

Representatives for Target and Swift did not immediately respond to requests Wednesday for comment. The sales put Swift in rare company. The only bigger nonfiction launch was the first volume of Barack Obama's presidential memoirs, ""A Promised Land,"" which sold 816,000 copies its first week on shelves in 2020, according to Circana, which does not include audio and e-book sales. But Obama's memoir was available through all major outlets and Circana's tracking for ""Eras Tour Book"" accounts only for its first weekend sales. Swift has arranged exclusive, non-traditional releases before. For her ""Eras"" concert film, which came out in 2023, she bypassed Hollywood studios and worked directly with AMC Theatres and Cinemark Theatres. ""Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour"" has made more than $200 million at the box office and stands as the highest grossing concert movie in history. Even before the ""Eras"" book, Swift has been a mini-genre in the publishing industry, the inspiration for biographies, romance fiction, fashion, coloring books and a cocktail recipe collection, ""Shake It Up."" Another top seller of 2024, according to Circana, is Wendy Loggia's ""Taylor Swift: A Little Golden Book Biography,"" designed in the tradition of such Little Golden favorites as ""The Three Bears"" and ""The Whispering Rabbit.""","eras, book, swift, weekend, sales, taylor, copies, obama, the, whispering, rabbit, bears, wendy, publishing, circana, thanksgiving, golden, theatres, barack, loggia"

The superstar, who is both the most awarded and nominated artist in Grammys history, has been up for the category four times before and many feel she has been snubbed by its top honors. In winning album of the year with ""Cowboy Carter,"" Beyoncé has become the first Black woman to win the top prize in the 21st century. The last was Lauryn Hill with ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"" 26 years ago. Before her was Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston. That means Beyoncé is only the fourth Black woman to win album of the year at the Grammys. Members of the Los Angeles Fire Department presented Beyoncé with the trophy, one of several times the show reflected the recent wildfires that burned thousands of homes. ""It's been many, many years,"" Beyoncé said in her speech. ""I want to dedicate this to Ms. Martell,"" she said, referencing Linda Martell, the performer who became the first Black woman to play the Grand Ole Opry. ""We finally saw it happen, everyone,"" host Trevor Noah said, nodding to the long overdue achievement for one of music's transcendent artists. Kendrick Lamar won song and record of the year for his diss track ""Not Like Us,"" taking home two of the night's most prestigious awards. ""We're gonna dedicate this one to the city,"" Lamar said before shouting out Los Angeles area neighborhoods. It is the second hip-hop single to ever win in the category. The first was Childish Gambino's ""This Is America."" The Weeknd mends fences, Chappell Roan challenges music industry The Weeknd has mended his fractious relationship with the Grammy Awards with a surprise performance of his new single, ""Cry For Me"" and ""Timeless"" with Playboi Carti. His decision is a direct reflection of the changes the Recording Academy has made to diversify its voting body, CEO Harvey Mason jr. said in his introduction. The Weeknd has been openly critical of the Grammys organization, dating back to 2020 when he wrote on Twitter: ""The Grammys remain corrupt."" It was just one of many pleasant surprises Sunday night. Chappell Roan was named best new artist. She read a speech from a notebook, speaking directly to major labels and the music industry, instructing them to ""offer a living wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists."" She described getting signed as a minor, getting dropped and entering the workforce during COVID-19 with no work experience and no health care. She asked them to treat artists like ""valuable employees."" ""Labels, we got you,"" she concluded her speech. ""But do you got us?"" Beyoncé and Chappell Roan give Grammys a country theme In one of the biggest moments of the evening so far, Taylor Swift presented the award for best country album to Beyoncé. She became the first Black woman to ever win in the category. ""Genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists,"" she said in her speech. ""I'm still in shock. Thank you so much for this honor."" Beyoncé entered the night as the leading nominee. A little bit of the wild west, a little bit of West Hollywood. Roan brought a rocking version of her ""Pink Pony Club"" to the Grammy stage. Joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys, she sang from atop a giant pink horse. Los Angeles on the mind In incorporating the wildfires throughout the show, the Grammys put the spotlight on the city's resiliency. Noah's opening speech was dedicated to those affected by the fires, promising a show that not only celebrates them, but one that also celebrates ""the city that brought us so much of that music."" The Grammys have also allotted ad time to be used by local businesses affected by the fires. As the show neared its end, Noah announced that viewers had contributed $7 million to relief efforts Sunday night so far. On a stage set up to look like the mountains of Los Angeles, the LA born-and-raised Billie Eilish and her brother/collaborator Finneas performed her hit ""Birds of a Feather."" It was one of a number of ways the show seeks to salute the city. ""We love you LA,"" she told the crowd at the end of the set. The show kicked off with a powerful opening performance of Randy Newman's ""I Love L.A."" by Dawes - whose members were directly affected by the Eaton fire - backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent. Star studded performances and victories The first televised award went to Doechii for best rap album for ""Alligator Bites Never Heal."" The tears were immediate. ""This category was introduced in 1989. Two women have won, Lauryn Hill -"" she said, correcting herself. ""Three women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii."" Will Smith introduced a tribute to the late, great, legendary producer Quincy Jones. ""In his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say he changed mine forever,"" he said. ""You probably wouldn't even know who Will Smith was without Quincy Jones."" Jones died in November at age 91. Kicked off by Cynthia Erivo, accompanied by Herbie Hancock on piano, the ""Wicked"" star sang Frank Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon."" Then came Lainey Wilson and Jacob Collier with ""Let the Good Times Roll,"" followed by Stevie Wonder and Hancock busting out ""Bluesette"" and ""We Are The World."" For the latter, they were joined by student singers from two schools that were lost in the LA-area fires. Then, Janelle Monae with an inspired rendition of ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,"" channeling Michael Jackson in a sparkly tuxedo and an effortless moonwalk. The Beatles' ""Now and Then,"" which used AI technology, took home best rock performance. Sean Lennon accepted the award on behalf of his father John Lennon. ""As far as I'm concerned, it's the best band of all time,"" he said of the Beatles. First time winners were abundant. They included Carpenter, Roan, Doechii, Charli xcx, songwriter Amy Allen, Música Mexicana star Carin León, French metal band Gojira and country folk artist Sierra Ferrell. The Red Hot Chili Peppers' Anthony Kiedis and Chad Smith led the crowd in a short singalong of their hit ""Under the Bridge,"" reminding the crowd to ""support their friends and neighbors as they rebuild their lives,"" said Kiedis. Then they presented the best pop vocal album award to Carpenter for ""Short n' Sweet."" ""I really wasn't expecting this,"" she said. ""This is, woo, my first Grammy so I'm going to cry."" (She's now won two, but the earlier award was handed out a pre-telecast ceremony that many artists don't attend.) She also performed. Winners use speeches to lift marginalized communities in tense political climate Shakira won Latin pop album for ""Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran"" and gave a powerful, short speech. ""I want to dedicate this award to all my immigrant brothers and sisters in this country,"" she said. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars teamed up for a cover of ""California Dreamin'."" Later, SZA presented them with the award for best pop duo/group performance for ""Die With A Smile."" ""Trans people are not invisible. ... The queer community deserves to be lifted up,"" Gaga said in her speech. Alicia Keys was awarded the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award ""DEI is not a threat, it's a gift,"" she said in her speech, referencing diversity, equity and inclusion programs that have been scrapped recently by the U.S. government and several major corporations.","the, grammys, award, album, los, angeles, cowboy, carter, noah, best, grammy, pink, speech, show, music, pop, pony, feather, eilish, newman"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/lady-gaga-strikes-a-chord-the-superstar-singer-rekindles-passion-for-music-with-new-album-mayhem,Lady Gaga strikes a chord: The superstar singer rekindles passion for music with new album 'Mayhem',Associated Press,2025-03-07 21:13:20,"LOS ANGELES, MARCH 7 When Lady Gaga walked into a New York City bar she frequented five years ago, the memories hit hard: Back then, she wrote songs there, feeling lost and disconnected from herself. But this time was different. While sitting in the bar, Gaga felt a sense of peace and rejuvenation, reminiscent of her teenage years spent scribbling lyrics on napkins. In recent years, Gaga rediscovered her passion for music by taking a step back from the limelight, cutting ties from fake friendships, swapping the spotlight for quiet nights at home and surrounding herself with people she truly trusts. That personal transformation became the soul of her new album, ""Mayhem,"" which is being released Friday. ""I reclaimed myself as an artist,"" said Gaga, a 14-time Grammy and one-time Oscar winner who returned to her dark pop music roots on the album, which spans 14 tracks. Her new project follows last year's "" Harlequin,"" a jazz-inspired companion album for the film ""Joker: Folie à Deux,"" which stalled at No. 20 on the Billboard 200. But Gaga's singles for the 14-track ""Mayhem"" have been received well on the charts, including "" Disease,"" "" Abracadabra "" and "" Die With a Smile,"" a collaboration with Bruno Mars, spending five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 1 and winning a Grammy for best pop duo/group performance earlier this month. While recording ""Mayhem,"" Gaga refused to rest on her past hits or accolades to define her new work. She credited her renewed creative drive to a journey of self-discovery, which ultimately empowered her to step back into the spotlight for several big moments last month. The superstar performed with Bruno Mars at the Grammys - including a tribute song ""California Dreamin'"" to Los Angeles wildfire victims, closed out the FireAid benefit concert with ""All I Need is Time"" and delivered a surprise performance singing ""Hold My Hand"" before the Super Bowl in New Orleans. Next month, Gaga will headline Coachella and perform a free concert on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach in May. ""I built a routine in my daily life around music all the time, and not around self-promotion,"" said Gaga, 38, who was a producer and co-executive producer with her fiancé Michael Polansky, 41, on ""Mayhem."" ""When my life was circulating self-promotion, I think I lost a lot of my passion. When my life was around my family, my partner and my music, it gave me back that realness."" In an AP interview, Gaga digs deeper into what it took to regain her passion, showing she's more than just a character and her pulling double duty on ""Saturday Night Live"" on Saturday. Determined to prove that she's the architect of her success While Gaga was dropping early hits like ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face,"" she noticed critics who downplayed her role in the success, giving more credit to producers and even stylists. With ""Mayhem,"" Gaga aimed to showcase that her talent was the true driving force behind her rise. Fueled by the skeptics, the singer is determined to show she's the architect of her success, not just another industry creation. ""They tried to qualify and quantify me,"" she said. ""Very often as a woman in music, they say it was other people. You're a product, like you were made. Something that was really important to me on this was really taking from myself my own inventions."" When Gaga began recording her new album, she focused on crafting the kind of dark pop melodies that defined her early career, pairing them with lyrics that spoke in code. She said it all came back naturally, giving her reassurance that she was on the right path to fully owning her identity as an artist instead of a made-up character ""This was a way for me actually to feel like I wasn't. That it was the real me,"" she said. ""I was the creator. This was my work. It was just not a character I was playing. It was something that I made."" How Gaga pushed fame away to reclaim her creative spark Early in her career, fame came with a price that Gaga wasn't willing to pay. She felt isolated, trapped in transactional relationships and struck in an environment that prioritized competition over creativity. The spotlight began to feel like an endless race, draining her passion for making music. She began to notice a shift as her sales climbed beyond the first 10 million records. Gaga realized that staying in that energy would ultimately stifle her creativity, knowing it was time to break free. ""I lost the thing that I would teach my child, which is to sit alone with your thoughts and write a poem,"" Gaga said. ""Sit alone and write a song. Just put good old-fashioned hard work and craftsmanship into what you believe in. I lost that for a long time."" Eventually, Gaga hit reset. She cut loose draining relationships and building a stable family with Michael Polansky and their beloved dogs. It helped Gaga channel her energy back into her artistry. ""This is the first day I've done interviews without makeup on, and it's nice,"" she said. ""I just get to share with you about my experience with music, and I'm not feeling pressure to perform for you in any other way than as a female artist."" Gaga on SNL In her appearance on ""Saturday Night Live,"" Gaga will showcase her range as both the musical guest and host. But her versatility might shine even brighter in the show's sketch comedy skits. ""I get to work in all different kinds of art that I love so much,"" said Gaga, who will make her second appearance as ""SNL"" host and fifth as its musical guest. The first time she appeared as host and musical guest was in 2013. Gaga performed during the "" SNL50: The Homecoming Concert "" last month. ""Doing 'SNL' is all about hard work,"" she said. ""It's a labor of love for the audience on Saturday night because we just want everybody to feel happy at home."" To prepare, Gaga is synching up with the cast and building rapport, which she says will help balance her roles throughout the night. ""I'll just be like really close with the cast,"" she said. ""They write like all the sketches and they work like all week long on planning, so I feel like the better my relationship is with them and just like getting in there and being one of them, the better the show will be."" Gaga added: ""I'm treating my musical performances separately. I have to wear like a few different hats. There's hosting and then there's being the actor in the sketch, and being the artist that I am in my music. I'm ready to do it though.""","her, the, my, los, angeles, album, concert, mayhem, character, pop, musical, copacabana, poker, sketch, time, artist, guest, billboard, dreamin, folie"

The New York City Council passed the bill (Intro-100), introduced by Korean-American Council Member Julie Won, unanimously on Thursday, January 23. This move officially recognizes Lhosar as an ASP holiday, making it easier for Himalayan communities to celebrate the festival without the hassle of moving parked vehicles. In New York City, the Department of Sanitation requires vehicles parked on the streets to be moved during daily street cleaning. After the council meeting, Council Member Julie Won and the Himalayan community organized a historic victory rally at the council grounds, attended by nearly 200 community members and several council representatives. Addressing the crowd, Council Member Won stated, ""This is the first and only ASP holiday in New York City dedicated to Buddhists from Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, Mongolia, India, and other countries. Over 61,000 New Yorkers celebrate Losar, and this bill is a significant milestone for our Tibetan and Himalayan communities. It is an honor to celebrate Losar with the community and to show respect for their culture."" The bill to add Losar as an Alternate Side Parking-exempt holiday is possibly the most significant municipal policy in recognition of the significant population of Tibetan Americans & Himalayan Buddhists to date, Nick Gulotta, Chief of Staff at NYC Council said. The program also included traditional performances, including Himalayan lion dances and Tibetan songs, added a cultural touch to the event. The bill had the backing of 40 co-sponsors, including representatives from Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan boroughs. It was passed unanimously by all 48 council members present. Organizations such as Sherpa Kyidug and others have been advocating for Lhosar's recognition since 2017. Lhosar, celebrated over 15 days, marks the Himalayan Lunar New Year with family gatherings, cultural events, and prayers for peace. This year, Lhosar falls on February 30.","council, parking, won, tibetan, himalayan, asp, holiday, julie, alternate, york, buddhists, yorkers, the, new, bill, lhosar, side, americans, city, member"

Addressing the 20th BIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting held today as part of the sixth BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok , she called for unity and collective cooperation to strengthen BIMSTEC as a platform that represents the shared aspirations of the citizens of the Bay of Bengal region. ""BIMSTEC symbolises a dazzling rainbow representing two dynamic regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia- each of its seven colours illuminating rich civilizations, cultures, histories, and ecological diversity. It should make efforts to unlock the potential for economic prosperity of the citizens of this region,"" the Minister said. Dr Rana reiterated Nepal's commitment to regionalism and multilateralism in a peaceful, equitable, and inclusive manner under the leadership of the United Nations. ""We are actively engaged in all regional and global forums to strengthen peace, security, and sustainable development. We are also proud to be the largest peacekeeping troop contributor to the United Nations."" She also reaffirmed Nepal's commitment to the charter, principles and objectives of BIMSTEC since becoming member in 2004. Highlighting challenges such as climate change, natural disasters, environmental degradation and the devastating effects of pollution, she urged immediate efforts for infrastructure enhancement, disaster early warning systems implementation and involvement of local communities in environmental protection. She welcomed India's proposal to initiate establishing BIMSTEC Centre of Excellence in Disaster Management, expressing confidence that it would complement regional efforts in controlling and combating natural disasters while leveraging AI to address all these challenges.

Speaking at the inauguration of an orientation programme on organization and contemporary issues for provincial presidents and heads of training departments, organized by the Nepali Congress Central Policy, Research, and Training Institute in Pokhara today, Party President Deuba mentioned that while it is difficult for any party to achieve a majority due to the existing inclusive and proportional political system, Nepali Congress can achieve a majority through united efforts. ""We have adopted an inclusive and proportional political system, making it difficult for any single party to gain a majority,"" he said. ""Nonetheless, we have succeeded in becoming the largest party. If there is genuine unity among all our party members, we can make Congress the majority party in the future."" He expressed the view that the operation of the state with constitutional provisions has ensured the representation of all ethnicities, languages, communities, and regions in the country. Leader Deuba stated that fulfilling the responsibilities entrusted by leaders like the late BP, Ganeshman, Krishna Prasad, and Girija Prasad requires unity and active participation within the party, characterized by harmonious relationships. Emphasizing the need to strengthen democracy, federalism, and inclusiveness gained through struggle, he stressed the importance of decentralizing power for the country's development. Expressing the notion of moving forward by making good use of the obtained rights, Party President Deuba urged leaders and cadres to always work in the best interest of the country and the people.

Speaking at a blanket distribution program organized by the Safe Motherhood Network Federation today, Minister Deuba highlighted the devastating impact of climate change on Nepal's environment and livelihoods. ""Unseasonal rainfall due to climate change in late September, after the monsoon had already retreated, caused flash floods and landslides,"" she said. ""Nepal is at significant risk of losing lives and property due to these unprecedented disasters."" She further emphasized that Nepal, despite contributing minimally to global climate change, has been disproportionately affected by its consequences. ""The floods and landslides that struck Nepal last September were caused by climate change, driven primarily by developed countries' actions. Nepal has endured substantial losses, yet it bears no responsibility for these disasters,"" she remarked. Minister Deuba also expressed concern about accountability at the global level. ""Who will compensate Nepal for the damage caused by unseasonal disasters? Nepalis are suffering for actions they did not commit, and we need answers to this injustice,"" she asserted. Highlighting the dire implications for future generations, she added, ""With water sources drying up due to climate change, the next generation will face severe challenges."" Minister Deuba also reflected on her personal journey, recounting her challenging childbirth experience. ""The pain I endured while giving birth brought me close to life and death. My survival inspired me to join this campaign to save other women from such ordeals,"" she explained, elaborating on her involvement in the Safe Motherhood Campaign. At the event, Minister Deuba distributed 1,090 blankets to representatives of Panauti and Namobuddha municipalities, as well as Roshi, Bethanchowk, Bhumlu, and Temal rural municipalities. The distribution was based on the number of pregnant and new mothers in these areas. Meanwhile, Nepali Congress leader Umesh Shrestha stressed the importance of empowering women through capacity-building and entrepreneurship, noting the underrepresentation of women in various sectors. Similarly, NC Kavre President Tirtha Lama urged Minister Deuba to expedite the reconstruction of the BP Highway, which was severely damaged by floods and landslides.

Debates are underway regarding the probable success or failure of this visit. Will it be like some of the visits in the past which are barely remembered? It might as well be that his successful visit will eclipse the remarkable visits to China by his illustrious predecessors like B P Koirala in particular. The political arena is naturally resonating with such discourses underway among political observers both in the country and outside. This visit has made a departure from the well-established tradition of first making a visit to India after a Prime Minister comes to power in Nepal. Unfortunately, it happened so as Oli did not receive an invitation from India even after the tour of the Minister for Foreign Affairs Arzoo Deuba especially for this purpose. Oli's meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly also did not bear any fruit. There are several factors responsible for this state of affairs. But the main one is the turbulence seen in Nepal-India friendship in the last decade, mostly with Oli as the prime minister. Firstly, India did not like the Federal Constitution of Nepal to the extent that it had sent then foreign secretary and now the Foreign Minister, S. Jaishankar to postpone its promulgation. But Nepal did not pay heed as it was a now or never kind of situation. What followed is an allegedly India-backed border blockade by the tarai-based political parties after they opposed the constitution. Nepal successfully defied the blockade, which exponentially increased the popularity of Oli. Realising that it was risky to put all eggs in one basket by remaining entirely dependent on India, Oli signed several agreements with China in 2016 and later in 2018, which irked India. The signing of the agreements related to the Belt and Road Policy, a brain child of Chinese President Xi to create a global Chinese network, has been yet another irritant in Nepal-India relations. When Oli formed a two-thirds majority coalition government with the Maoist Centre, riding on the crest of the successful faceoff with India, the border incursion of Lipu Lake and Limpiyadhura came to the fore, which was lying dormant till then. It became more prominent after India built a road passing though the disputed territory. When Nepal's diplomatic efforts to resolve the problem through dialogue virtually fell on the deaf ears of the Indian government, it prepared a new pointed map showing the disputed territory on Nepal's map. It was supported by all the political parties and parliamentary members of Nepal apart from a solitary Sarita Giri of the Samajbadi Party who was later sacked for party indiscipline. The outspoken character of Oli has also contributed towards the present unease in Indo-Nepal relations. One of them is his recent assertion that Ayodhya was in Thori, Nepal. But travellers like China's Fa Hein and later Guru Nanak visited Ayodhya of India. That Fa Hein came to Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, suggests that he would have come to Thori and so would have Nanak had it been the case. The Belt and Road policy has, however, been one of the thorny problems in Nepal- China relation. China wishes to implement the projects more on Chinese loans and less on grants. One of the coalition partners of the Oli-headed government, the Nepali Congress, is worried that it may fall into a debt trap like Sri Lanka and is thus in favour of grants more than loans. Nepal and China share a cordial relationship since time immemorial. It begins with the visit of several Chinese travellers to Nepal during the Licchavi period. The Bandung Conference held in 1955 forms another milestone in Sino-Nepal relations with Premier Zhou En Li proposing that relations be based on the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. On Premier Zhou's invitation, Prime Minister Tanka Prasad Acharya of Nepal made the first official visit to China in 1956. Premier Zhou visited paid a return visit to Nepal in 1957, paving the way for bettering India-China relations. Nepal's first elected and charismatic Prime Minister B. P. Koirala visited China in 1960. Prime Minister Kriti Nidhi Bista popped in during the Panchayat democracy in Nepal. It was followed by the arrival of China's pragmatic leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978, Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang in 1981, President Li Xiannian in 1984, Premier Li Peng in 1984 and President Xi Jinping in 2019 to Nepal. In the following years, Girija Prasad Koirala and Mana Mohan Adhikari also departed for China. Likewise, Prime Ministers K P Oli and Prachanda, and Nepal's President Vidya Bhandari also followed suit. Apart from BP Koirala and Bista's visits, the other visits have however left much to be desired. Whilst Koirala solved the long-standing border problems, Bista was instrumental in removing the Indian check posts that were stationed along the Sino-Nepali border. Oli has the opportunity to rub shoulders with them if he can develop the much-needed connectivity between China and Nepal. Nepal can benefit by being a hub for the neighbouring Asian giants, China and India, to develop trading activities. For this he should be able to enter into agreements with China for executing the connectivity projects consisting of roads and train tracks which have already been identified. And these projects should be on grant basis as Nepal's loans have already mounted to 40 per cent of its GDP. It is obvious that it cannot take any further loans. This visit thus stands as an acid test of Oli. If he is successful, his critics for his failure to honour the tradition of visiting India first also will be silenced greatly.","the, li, visit, zhou, koirala, minister, prime, nepal, visits, sino, bista, constitution, loans, oli, hein, nanak, kriti, nidhi, peng, xiannian"

""Recent Cabinet meeting has decided to compulsorily include woman member for a visit as foreign delegation. Happy to share that government has appointed woman as Chief Secretary,"" she said, vowing fulfillment of 21 points to be presented in the CEDAW. The Chairperson of Women and Social Committee under the House of Representatives, Kiran Kumar Sah, said only two women were made ministers because there was no reservation for women in Council of Ministers. It needs attention, Sah stressed. On the occasion, Chair of National Women Commission, Kamala Kumari Parajuli, shared that the programme was organized to help make CEDAW periodic report more effective. Newly appointed Chief Secretary Leela Devi Gadtaula, however, said that women issues were being forwarded with proper attention from the Cabinet lately. She reminded that although she was on 8th position in terms of seniority, she was made the Chief Secretary. Similar case was practiced when Leela Mani Paudyal became the Chief Secretary. The Chief Secretary was felicitated by Foreign Minister at the programme.","women, cedaw, leela, deuba, cabinet, gadtaula, rana, secretary, foreign, committee, chief, devi, dr, the, arzu, chairperson, commission, ministers, minister, reservation"

It is believed that approximately 400 of the 2,600 Nepali students who went to Bangladesh to study medicine are still there. More than 2,000 Nepali students have returned home in recent weeks, thanks to coordination with the Nepali Embassy. ""There are now around 400 Nepali students here. Most of them are doing internships in hospitals. They are all safe and have been told to contact the embassy if they want to return to Nepal,"" reads the letter issued by the embassy. Due to the indefinite curfew imposed in most parts of Bangladesh, including the capital Dhaka, since Sunday evening, the embassy has advised Nepalis not to attempt to leave the country on their own. The Nepali Embassy in Dhaka has issued a travel advisory, urging Nepalis in Bangladesh to exercise caution. ""Requesting all Nepalis to stay safe where they live and exercise maximum vigilance,"" said the statement issued by the embassy on Monday. The embassy has also confirmed that Nepalese in Bangladesh are safe. The embassy has advised students and other Nepalis who wish to return to Nepal to ""travel only after security arrangements are ensured,"" in coordination with the embassy. The embassy has also published two phone numbers for coordinating a return to Nepal. According to the embassy, Nepalis can obtain assistance by calling +8801880691013 or +8801745407958. Earlier, the Nepali Embassy had planned to transport Nepali students from Bangladesh to Kakarbhita, Nepal's eastern border, via the Indian road. Officials, students, and their parents were informed that some Nepali students had returned to Nepal by air. Broadband internet in Bangladesh was disrupted for a few hours on Monday, but it resumed operation in the afternoon. Previously, social media and 4G services were suspended beginning on Sunday. The Nepali Embassy in Dhaka has stated that it is in constant contact with the students, as well as the college and university administration, about their situation in Bangladesh. According to the Embassy, Nepali citizens in Bangladesh are not in immediate danger, but they have been advised to remain vigilant. Bangladesh has closed its schools and universities since last July, when violence erupted against the government's continued reservation and quota system. Bangladesh's highest court ordered the invalidated majority of the reservation system, but protests continued. Along with the curfew order, the government declared a three-day public holiday beginning Monday. According to recent reports, the situation there has deteriorated. Most Nepalese students have travelled to various cities in Bangladesh to study MBBS. Apart from that, students travel to Bangladesh to study agriculture and engineering. According to officials, the Nepalis have reached cities such as Sylhet, Chittagong, and Rangpur, in addition to Dhaka. In light of the ongoing unrest and political developments in Bangladesh, the Nepalese government has increased security measures along its border with India to prevent the infiltration of citizens from third countries. Security personnel have been instructed by the Ministry of Home Affairs to exercise increased caution in order to prevent unauthorised entry through international border areas. The Armed Police Force (APF) spokesperson, DIG Kumar Neupane, stated that the Ministry has instructed the security personnel stationed for border security to take the appropriate precautions to avoid similar incidents.","students, the, embassy, nepali, security, border, reservation, nepalis, curfew, infiltration, broadband, nepalese, armed, 400, personnel, force, situation, vigilance, arrangements, precautions"

Speaking at a training session organized by the Nepali Congress Central Training Academy in Bhairahawa today, Minister Rana remarked, ""Nepalis abroad are facing such dire challenges that, at times, it seems as though the primary function of the Foreign Ministry has been reduced to rescue operations."" She acknowledged the immense difficulty in carrying out these rescues due to resource constraints, including a shortage of human capital. At present, Nepal has diplomatic missions in only 40 countries, whereas Nepalis reside in over 100 nations worldwide. The Minister further admitted that the Ministry lacks comprehensive records on the whereabouts of Nepalis abroad or how they got there, except in cases where individuals encounter difficulties and require repatriation. Citing the example of Nepali medical students in Bangladesh, she revealed that the Ministry only became aware of their numbers when the need for their evacuation arose. ""Despite limited staffing, the Nepali Embassy in Dhaka facilitated the safe return of stranded students,"" she recalled, emphasizing that similar challenges persist elsewhere, and the Ministry continues to respond despite severe resource constraints. Expressing deep concern over the growing number of Nepali women illegally traveling to Middle Eastern countries-despite a government ban on domestic work in the region-she warned that such unauthorized migration makes rescue efforts even more challenging. On a different note, Minister Rana clarified that the Ministry has introduced a new position to enhance consular services for the Nepali diaspora and strengthen Nepal's foreign relations beyond traditional diplomacy. This decision, she stated, followed an Organization and Management survey and is expected to streamline diplomatic functions in the near future. She also highlighted the establishment of Nepali consulate offices in Texas, San Francisco, and Dubai-regions with substantial Nepali populations but no prior diplomatic presence. Cautioning against over-reliance on foreign aid, Minister Rana pointed to reports that the U.S. government is considering halting its assistance to Nepal. She urged the Nepali Congress to spearhead a grassroots movement to create employment opportunities domestically, ensuring sustainable national development.","foreign, nepali, rana, ministry, constraints, the, training, resource, arzu, rescuer, organization, whereabouts, rescues, portion, diplomatic, deuba, minister, staffing, consulate, diaspora"

Pushpa Kamal Dahal met Narendra Modi in New Delhi during a four-day visit to India, his first trip abroad since taking office last December. After the meeting, the two prime ministers remotely inaugurated several projects, including a cargo railway line and two border checkpoints, and oversaw the signing of a slew of agreements. Modi said they agreed to further deepen their historic ties and ""take our relations to Himalayan heights."" He said they agreed to resolve all their outstanding issues, including a border dispute. Dahal said at a joint news conference that they reviewed ongoing projects and discussed ways to further cooperate in connectivity, energy and people-to-people contact. New Nepalese prime ministers traditionally visit neighboring India soon after taking office. Nepal is bordered on three sides by India, with an open frontier allowing traffic without passports or visas. Until recently, India was a dominant force in Nepal, but China's involvement has grown in the last few years. China has invested in the building of airports, highways and hydropower projects. Beijing views Nepal as key to its massive transcontinental infrastructure Belt and Road Initiative that builds on old Silk Road routes that once connected China to the West. Landlocked Nepal, however, remains dependent on India for all its oil needs and many other necessities. In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Nepali Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud said his country will work to enhance its relations with both India and China while maintaining a policy of nonalignment. India has been wary of Nepal since it elected a communist government in 2017. A coalition government headed by a communist prime minister has again taken power after an election in late 2022. Relations with India soured in 2015, when it supported protests by ethnic groups in southern Nepal against a new constitution and imposed an unofficial economic blockade, shutting down the supply of oil and goods over the border. The previous communist government issued a new map of the country in 2020 that includes an area claimed by both India and Nepal, further angering New Delhi. This is Dahal's third time in office since his Maoist group abandoned a decade-long armed revolt and joined a UN-assisted peace process and entered mainstream politics in 2006. The conflict killed more than 17,000 people.","communist, silk, new, ministers, projects, delhi, border, relations, prime, road, revolt, china, saud, narayan, checkpoints, prakash, minister, frontier, the, slew"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/nepal-rastra-bank-unveils-monetary-policy-for-fy-2080-81,Nepal Rastra Bank unveils Monetary Policy for FY 2080-81,Tht Online,2023-07-23 21:05:30,"KATHMANDU, JULY 12 The eagerly anticipated monetary policy for the fiscal year 2080/81 was publicly unveiled through the website of the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB). The policy announcement includes several significant measures aimed at addressing the prevailing economic conditions and fostering financial stability. Interest rate measures The policy rate has been reduced by 50 basis points, bringing it down to 6.5 percent. This reduction is intended to promote borrowing and investments, thereby spurring economic growth. Meanwhile, the bank rate remains unchanged at 7.5 percent, emphasizing the central bank's commitment to maintaining financial stability and controlling inflation. Deposit collection and liquidity management To enhance liquidity in the banking system, the deposit collection rate has been lowered from 5.5 percent to 4.5 percent, encouraging banks to collect more deposits. The weighted average interbank interest rate will be utilized as the operational target to facilitate efficient interbank lending and borrowing, ensuring better monetary control. Secondary market transactions and deposit collection To promote liquidity management, if the weighted average interbank interest rate falls between the bank rate and the deposit collection rate, it will trigger the opening of secondary market transactions and encourage deposit collection initiatives. Stability measures The mandatory cash ratio and statutory liquidity ratio have been retained at their current levels. These ratios ensure that banks maintain a certain percentage of their deposits in the form of cash or liquid assets, contributing to overall financial system stability. Enhancing interest rate corridor Arrangements are being made to establish a permanent deposit collection facility at the lower limit of the interest rate corridor to strengthen its effectiveness. This measure enhances the central bank's ability to regulate interest rates within a specified range. Reviewing risk weighting provisions for share mortgage and loans In this year's monetary policy, no changes were made to the existing arrangements regarding share securities, maintaining the status quo from the previous policy. The previous policy's maximum limit of 12 crore rupees for a single customer to obtain margin loans from one or multiple licensed financial institutions also remains unchanged. Share investors' requests for eased share mortgage loan provisions were not addressed in this policy. However, the policy promises to review the risk weighting for share/securities loans, real estate loans, and higher purchase loans, aiming to make it more convenient for banks to provide loans on share securities within the 12 crore limit. Real estate policy and loans The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) maintains the previous policy in the real estate business for the current financial year. Loans on real estate mortgages are allowed based on a maximum of 30 percent of the fair market value in the Kathmandu Valley and a maximum of 40 percent in other locations. The NRB did not concede to demands to increase the credit limit to 70 percent on real estate mortgages, considering real estate as unproductive. First home buyer loan limit increase The NRB made a significant concession to the general public buying their first home by increasing the loan limit for first home buyers from Rs. 1.5 crore to Rs. 2 crore in the current monetary policy. This move aims to support and encourage first-time homebuyers, making it easier for them to enter the real estate market and own a residential property. Regulating microfinance sector and overseas travel provisions The NRB aims to reduce the number of microfinance institutions by encouraging mergers and acquisitions in the sector. Integration is expected to be completed by the end of Ashad 2081. The monetary policy also includes enhanced provisions for Nepali citizens traveling abroad, allowing them to receive up to USD 2,500 as a passport facility, an increase from the previous limit of USD 1,500. Additionally, licensed ""A"" class commercial banks can facilitate payments of up to one hundred thousand US dollars or other convertible foreign currency for air service providers abroad based on regulatory approval and prescribed documentation. Controlling inflation and managing loan growth The NRB's aim is to limit inflation to 6.5 percent in the current financial year. Monetary management strategies will be employed to maintain stable economic conditions and prevent price pressure from monetary expansion. To ensure financial stability, the NRB sets a growth rate limit of 11.5 percent for loans to the private sector, aiming to prevent excessive credit expansion and manage potential economic imbalances. The NRB's approach seeks to strike a balance between supporting economic activities and managing risks.","policy, monetary, limit, percent, the, rate, deposit, estate, loans, interest, crore, bank, nrb, interbank, liquidity, collection, share, loan, provisions, real"

During the felicitation event, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation, Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, stated that Shengtao's feat would open up new opportunities for the flourishing tourism industry in Nepal. Joint Secretary Lamichhane also mentioned that Nepal has been actively promoting paragliding education through formal channels, with schools offering training in this exhilarating skill. Li Shengtao fondly reminisced about his first paragliding experience in Pokhara in 2015 and how it had ignited his dream of paragliding from Everest. ""When I first paraglided in Pokhara in 2015, I decided to pursue paragliding seriously. I underwent paragliding courses in 2016 and progressively paraglided from mountains ranging from 5,000 to 7,000 meters in China. This experience fueled my desire to paraglide from Everest, and I finally made that attempt,"" Li Shengtao shared. Tourism entrepreneur Karna Shakya expressed his belief that introducing new ideas and products in the tourism sector could significantly contribute to Nepal's tourism development.

In a message of best wishes he gave to a programme marking the 17th National Information Day organized by the National Information Commission here today, the PM pointed out the need of having legal provisions that incentivize providing information on topics as bribery, dillydally, wrong decisions and opaque dealings in public entities. ""It is necessary to conduct a study on the 'block chain technology' based on new technology that is used around the world as corruption control measure. Now is high time we do away with the tradition of keeping the personal information, including the assets, of every person holding a public post,"" the Prime Minister said, adding that there is the risk of corruption thriving due to the prevailing situation of least vigilance by the general public on the works and activities of public officials and the civil society having minimum access to State information. On the occasion, the Head-of-the-Government complained that the citizenry has not been able to extensively exercise the Right to Information (RTI) despite long time since the implementation of the RTI Act. ""Although the constitution and the laws consider citizens to be the real masters of information retained by all public bodies, it is felt that their access to all sorts of information is not established. Similarly, the public bodies have to be made more responsible and accountable in implementation of laws,"" the PM asserted. As he said, the provision of right to information is not only for a limited number of people who have access to the public entities, but it is also for the members of the general public including the peasants, workers, women, Dalits and marginalized communities, who are neglected and oppressed by the State for years. He also reminded that Nepal's RTI Act is in the list of best RTI laws of the world, saying implementing it in an effective way will help make the government's activities open and transparent in keeping with the democratic norms and in making the governance mechanism responsible and accountable to the citizenry. ""To enhance the access and participation of the masses in the State information is the culture of the democratic system per se,"" PM Dahal reiterated and stressed on the need of increased use of digital governance in public bodies in Nepal in tune with the rapid development of ICT. The Prime Minister assured of the government's all types of support to the National Information Commission for enhancing its capacity in the implementation of RTI.","the, information, public, rti, entities, access, bodies, dahal, 17th, national, citizenry, peasants, right, corruption, laws, state, dealings, government, sorts, pushpa"

In a discussion with journalists at Tikapur, Kailali district on Sunday, Chair Bhattarai, also former Prime Minister, reiterated that such a committee was needed because corruption cases of all scale would come to fore and true investigation could be conducted into those cases. Stating that there had been huge corruption from high officials, he claimed that all those facts were yet to come to light. ""The innocent ones should not be prosecuted while no culprit should be spared,"" he said. According to him, the incumbent government had delivered some promising works regarding corruption but there was no condition to be satisfied yet. As for his alleged involvement in the Lalita Niwas land grab scam, he said that he was ready to face the music if he is proven guilty. He demanded an impartial investigation into the scam. On a different note, leader Bhattarai argued that it was the need of hour to move ahead towards socialism on the base of democratic republic. ""There should be a structural change. There should be system of appointing President and Chief Minister through First-Past-The-Post system. We had raised the same issue in the past. We are going to public with this agenda.

Speaking at a press conference here today, the leader of the opposition said that only a high-level probe committee could reach the bottom of the gold smuggling case. Oli said the CIB-led investigation of the gold smuggling case was being conducted under a superintendent of police who could succumb to pressure from his higher-up SSP. He said the connection with the racketeers could be clearly seen. ""We have seen reports that telephone contacts were established with the gold smuggling racketeers 234 times. Today, a daily newspaper reported that CPN-Maoist Centre leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara and his son had telephonic conversation with Chinese gold smuggling racketeers 22 times and 234 times respectively. Oli stressed he never said the allegation that Nepali Congress lawmaker Sunil Sharma had obtained fake academic certificate could not be probed. He, however, maintained that launching a probe against him at this time when he had demanded the resignation of ministers more than raised eyebrows. Oli said Sharma was arrested after a political cadre was told to lodge a complaint against him. If such arrests are made after getting complaints lodged by political cadres, everybody could become a victim of false indictment, Oli added. He said rumour was being spread that all political leaders would be probed and they would be put in jail. He said the home minister should take responsibility for gold smuggling. Oli said that a parliamentary probe committee would not give any result as the ruling parties had clear majority in the Parliament and they would seek their majority in the parliamentary probe committee. Oli said that the government had failed to deliver service and make policies in favour of the people and hence the government should resign. Stating that the economy was in shambles, Oli said that a situation could arise in a few months when Nepalis would not be able to buy enough goods with what they earned.

The CPN-UML, the principal opposition party in the Parliament has been stalling House proceedings with the demand for high level probe committee. The NC's Parliamentary Party said its serious attention was drawn to the seizure of one quintal gold smuggled through Tribhuvan International Airport. ""It's a matter of serious concern that gold is smuggled through TIA, which is always under the surveillance of all important government bodies. Such incidents had happened in the past as well and their recurrence is a matter of grave concern,"" the NC PP added. It stated in its press release that the gold smuggling case should be probed independently and impartially and whoever is involved must be brought to book. The ruling party also noted that the gold smuggling case is currently being probed by Central Investigation Bureau. The UML has been demanding that a high-level probe committee be formed to investigate all those involved in gold smuggling cases. UML Chair KP Sharma Oli recently said that a parliamentary probe would not be effective as the ruling parties would have majority in such a body. UML leaders have said that high level probe committee is necessary to investigate the gold smuggling case thoroughly and recommend comprehensive measures to effectively check gold smuggling. The NC PP termed the UML obstruction in the Parliament improper and irresponsible. The NC PP expressed concern that the UML's continued obstruction in the Parliament had prevented discussion on some urgent issues such as the devastation caused by recent floods, lumpy skin disease, and outbreak of dengue and conjunctivitis. It also said some crucial bills such as Truth and Reconciliation Act (Amendment) Bill, Anti-money laundering bill and anti-corruption bill needed to be passed urgently. NC PP also decided to hold dialogue with the UML and other political parties to end the House obstruction. The NC PP also urged the government to bring bills that are necessary to implement the constitution, strengthen the federal democratic republican order, ensure fundamental rights and grant voting rights to Nepali migrant workers in foreign countries. Stating that the government had taken some positive steps to control inflation, the NC PP urged the government to take additional measures to control price rise and provide essential goods to the public at affordable prices. The NC PP stated that the party was in favour of independent and impartial investigation of all cases. ""No innocent people should be framed and no guilty ones should escape punishment, this is our party's policy,"" the NC PP added. It also urged the government to lift the ban on plotting of land in all parts of the country.

Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police, which is leading the investigation in the gold smuggling racket, arrested the Chinese nationals on the ground that they could lead to the actual owner of the gold that was seized. Among the arrested are Tian Mi, Wen Tong, Ding Sheg Sa and Li Nengkai. Nepal Police spokesperson DIG Kuber Kadayat said that they have received permission to hold the accused in judicial custody and are investigating the case in detail. ""Our investigation is targeted at finding out the true owner of the gold and to bust the smuggling racket,"" Kadayat said. On July 19, the Department of Revenue Investigation had recovered some boxes of motorbike brake shoes outside the customs office at Tribhuvan International Airport with a gross weight of 155 kilograms. The smugglers had concealed the gold inside the brake shoes, which was at first thought to be 100 kilograms. The Mint Division of Nepal Rastra Bank, after extracting the gold, revealed that the actual weight of gold was 60 kilograms and 716 grams. Earlier the racket was investigated by the DoRI. Later, the case was taken over by the CIB on the ground that the gold smuggling racket was inter-country and it fell under organised crime. So far, 21 persons have been arrested in relation to the smuggling racket, including customs employees, customs agents, drivers, middle men and the people under whose company name the brake shoes were imported. Police and authorities, however, are still unable to reach the real owner of the gold.

Speaking in today's meeting of the National Assembly, UML lawmaker Devendra Dahal demanded the formation of a probe committee comprising representatives of the government and various political parties in this regard. ""A high level probe committee should be formed. If there is no fair investigation by forming such a committee, such incidences of smuggling will continue,"" he said. In case of the formation of a parliamentary probe committee, it should also involve representatives of the members of the National Assembly, he viewed. He also demanded the response from Home Minister and Finance Minister in the parliament relating to the security of the airport and probity of customs office while calling for bringing the respective minister and the chief of the airport, and customs office employees under the scope of investigations. Referring to the airport customs chief and the security chief, who stayed on leave when the gold smuggling took place, he suspected something fishy in the case. Mentioning that a huge cache of gold was smuggled into Nepal through the airport on July 19, he said, gold smuggling is a serious issue. ""Nepal has become a transit for gold smuggling,"" he said. Shortly after Dahal put forth his views, the UML protested the advancement of the parliament business by the NA Chair Ganesh Prasad Timilsina.

As soon as House proceedings began today in the House of representatives, opposition lawmakers from CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party, and Rastriya Prajatantra Party rose from their chairs to stall House proceedings following which Speaker Devraj Ghimire gave UML lawmaker Raghuji Panta time to speak. Panta said the PM's remarks undermined the prestige and dignity of the country and he should step down. He further said Nepalis had to hang their heads in shame due to the PM's remarks. ""Shouldn't we turn to the Nepali people to make somebody the prime minister? Why should anybody go to New Delhi to make somebody the prime minister?"" he wondered. He added that the PM's remarks undermined the dignity and prestige of the country. Stating that patriotic Nepalis, including Bhakti Thapa, took bullets protecting the country's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, he said the PM had attacked the country's independence. ""Is the PM's post above the country's pride, territorial integrity and dignity?"" he wondered. Panta said that although the PM had assured him before his India visit recently that he would do everything to protect and promote Nepal's interest, he failed to raise the eminent persons group's report, which the Indian Prime Minister is yet to receive. He said the PM did not raise the issue of the Treaty of 1950 and Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani. ""Now the PM brags about reaching understanding with India to sell 10,000 MW hydel energy to India, but the fact is India won't buy that energy if it is generated with third country investment,"" he added. He said the PM had accepted a policy that would give India unilateral control over Nepal's hydro power. Speaker Ghimire then gave time to CPN-Maoist Centre lawmaker Chhiring Damdul Lama, but when Lama was speaking, opposition lawmakers rose from their chairs and sloganeered, stalling House proceedings. The speaker then postponed the House proceedings for half-an- hour. In the Upper House too, UML lawmaker Devendra Dahal spoke about the PM's alleged remarks. He said the PM's remarks gave the impression that Nepal's PM was appointed at the behest of India and such a PM could not be accepted. ""If he became the PM at the behest of India, he has no right to remain as PM. The PM should immediately step down,"" the UML lawmaker added. He said UML would continue to obstruct the House until the PM resigned. While Speaker Ghimire postponed the House meeting till Friday, Chair of National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina postponed the House meeting till 1:01pm tomorrow. Meanwhile, PM Dahal today said at a programme organised by NCP-MC student union that his remarks were being distorted and the motive behind the obstruction of House proceedings was to scuttle the anti-loan shark bill.

El-Sissi welcomed Modi at the presidential palace in Cairo with the Order of the Nile, the Egyptian presidency said in a statement. The leaders signed a declaration elevating Egyptian-Indo ties to a ""strategic partnership,"" which means the two nations agreed to intensify their cooperation and hold periodic talks, the statement said. Egypt and India share deep ties that date back to the 1950s, when they played key roles in founding the Non-Aligned Movement, which had sought an alternative path at the height of the Cold War. Modi, who arrived in Cairo on Saturday, is the first Indian prime minister to pay a state visit to Egypt in more than two decades. His two-day stop came six months after el-Sissi was in New Delhi as an official guest at India's Independence Day. Modi also invited the Egyptian leader to attend a summit of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing countries, which India will host in September. Following his talks with el-Sissi, Modi visited a historic mosque, Cairo's Al-Hakim, which was recently renovated with the help of the India-based Dawoodi Bohra community. He also paid tribute to Indian soldiers who died in World War I and are buried in the Heliopolis War Cemetery in Cairo. Modi's trip to Egypt has focused on strengthening bilateral ties. The prime minister said both countries have been moving swiftly to increase bilateral trade to $12 billion annually within five years - that's up from $7.3 billion in 2021-22. ""My visit to Egypt was a historic one. It will add renewed vigor to India-Egypt relations and will benefit the people of our nations,"" Modi wrote on Twitter. Earlier this year, both countries agreed to boost trade cooperation. India, the world's most populous country, is one of the top five importers of Egyptian products, including crude oil and liquefied natural gas, salt, cotton, inorganic chemicals, and oilseeds. Major Indian exports to Egypt include cotton yarn, coffee, herbs, tobacco, lentils, vehicle parts, ships, boats, and electrical machinery. El-Sissi and Modi, who came to power in their counties in 2014, have in recent years cultivated closer relationship. And over the last 16 months, they resisted pressure form the West to condemn the Russian war in Ukraine. Both Egypt and India have decades-old ties with the Kremlin. ""There is a change in the global geopolitical and geoeconomic atmosphere wherein both countries wish to play a defining role,"" India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said during a visit to Cairo in September. ""Egypt's geostrategic location acts as a connecting link between Africa, West Asia, the Mediterranean, and Europe and is also an important country from the Indo-Pacific point of view."" Modi arrived from the United States, where he held talks with President Joe Biden and top administration officials, addressed the Congress and met with top American executives. His meeting with el-Sissi came as global attention focused on a brief rebellion by the head of Wagner Group, seen as the greatest challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin in his more than two decades in power. Neither leader commented on the Russian crisis.","egyptian, the, egypt, sissi, indo, war, indian, dawoodi, hakim, nile, bohra, ties, cairo, fattah, rajnath, abdel, modi, minister, el, president"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/media-advocacy-group-unveils-research-report-on-women-journalists-covering-foreign-affairs,Media Advocacy Group unveils research report on women journalists covering foreign affairs,Tht Online,2023-05-09 15:39:03,"KATHMANDU, MAY 9 Media Advocacy Group (MAG), in partnership with the US Embassy, recently conducted a study titled ""Status of Nepali Women Journalists Covering Foreign Affairs"" to explore the participation status of women journalists in foreign affairs reporting, identify factors contributing to their under representation in this field, and develop strategies to increase their participation. The findings of the research were made public during an event organized by MAG in Pulchowk on May 8, 2023. The ceremony was chaired by Anita Bindu, President of MAG, and Ministry of Communication & Information Technology Rekha Sharma, was the Chief Guest. Additionally, Ambassador Dean R. Thompson of the United States Embassy in Nepal attended the event as a special guest The research was carried out from November 2022- February 2023. The study utilized a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques, including online surveys, focused group discussions, and in-depth interviews. According to the press release issued by MAG, the online survey was conducted among 500 women journalists. Among the surveyed women journalists, only 13.3% were engaged in political beats and 6.6% were engaged in foreign affairs and security affairs reporting. Regarding the status of participation of women journalists in foreign affairs reporting, only 2.9% of respondents considered that women journalists have high status in foreign affairs and security reporting, while 24.3% claimed it to be moderate, and a huge majority of respondents, i.e., 72.8%, shared that women journalists have less status in foreign and security affairs reporting. Regarding the reason for the low representation of women journalists in foreign affairs reporting, 23.6% of surveyed respondents shared that gender stereotypes and gender biases in the media are the main reasons for the under representation of women in foreign affairs reporting and diplomacy. 19.8% of respondents claimed it was the lack of interest and knowledge in foreign affairs reporting and diplomacy. 16% considered foreign affairs reporting to be more challenging than other beats and cited this as the main reason for the low number of women in foreign affairs reporting. 15.1% of respondents shared that women are underrepresented in Nepali media, which leads to fewer women in foreign affairs reporting. 13.2% claimed that senior management does not trust women reporters in foreign affairs reporting, and 6.6% claimed that foreign affairs reporting requires tremendous effort, time, and dedication with the same payment as in other beat reporting. 2.8% believed proficiency in the English language also affected the interest to cover foreign affairs. Regarding their interest in pursuing a media career in foreign and securing affairs reporting, 85.6% showed their interest in pursuing a career in foreign and securing affairs reporting, while 7.7% showed no interest, and 6.7% were not sure whether they would further their career in foreign and securing affairs reporting. On improving the participation of women journalists in foreign and security affairs reporting, 51.8% of respondents believed that capacity building of women journalists in foreign affairs reporting is important, while 21.2% stressed the need for gender-responsive media house policies to encourage more women journalists to cover foreign affairs reporting; 14.4% said that letting go of the mindset that foreign affairs is a beat that only men can cover, and 9.6% believed that developing personal interest in pursuing the foreign affairs beat is important. Foreign affairs issues are complicated in the case of Nepal due to its complex geopolitical location and other ties with other countries in terms of economic, political, and cultural context. Reporting on foreign issues can be sometimes tricky as it can be related to the status of the country. Being a highly intellectual and diplomatic issue, reporting on foreign issues is difficult too. On top of that challenges include gender-based discrimination and bias, lack of motivation and awareness, exclusion from professional networks and sources, and limited opportunities for career advancement are other concerns for the under representation of women journalists in foreign affairs reporting. The women journalists feel undervalued and underrepresented in their field and highlight the need for greater support and mentorship for women in foreign affairs and security reporting. To address these challenges, the study identifies various strategies that could help increase women journalists' representation in foreign affairs and security reporting. These include providing more opportunities for training and professional development, developing specialized expertise in certain areas of foreign affairs reporting, increasing the visibility and recognition of women journalists including building networks and alliances with other women journalists, and creating more supportive and inclusive workplaces to promote gender equality in newsrooms. The study emphasized the need for greater support and recognition for women journalists in foreign affairs and security reporting. This includes providing more opportunities for women journalists to access sources and build their expertise, as well as promoting greater diversity and inclusion in newsrooms and professional associations. Overall, the findings of this study shed light on the need to address challenges faced by women journalists in foreign affairs reporting and to take concrete steps to support and empower women in this field. By promoting greater diversity and inclusion in foreign affairs reporting, we can help to ensure that a wider range of perspectives and voices are represented in the global conversation on important issues. Speaking at the event, Ambassador Dean R. Thompson, U.S. Embassy in Nepal, acknowledged the significant disparity of 85% interest and only 6.6% participation among women journalists in foreign affairs reporting, which highlights the prevalent issue of censorship and self-censorship they face. The embassy seeks to improve conditions for women journalists by offering programs and grants. Ambassador Thompson underlined the significance of combating misinformation and disinformation, which divide society and cause media pandemonium, resulting in bad public opinion consequences. Ambassador Thompson emphasized the significance of countering misinformation and disinformation to ensure a more informed society. He expresses gratitude to all journalists for their profession, recognizing that journalism serves as a vital pillar of democracy. At the same event, Communication Minister Rekha Sharma advocated for the prompt implementation of the Mass Communications Act, emphasizing its importance for all. Minister Sharma, stressed the need to establish good governance to ensure media influence and credibility in disseminating accurate information. MAG is a national-level NGO that has been working in Nepal since 2008, promoting gender equality, women's empowerment, and the Right to Information through media mobilization. MAG has also been working in the field of misinformation and disinformation and MAG has consistently advocated for the capacity building of women journalists in Nepal and conducted several researches concerning them.","journalists, women, the, affairs, media, foreign, status, reporting, representation, gender, embassy, interest, study, thompson, participation, information, guest, career, beats, findings"

In this revered tradition dating back to Vedic period, cows are worshipped as the symbol of Goddess Laxmi on the day of Kartik Krishna Aunshi (no moon day of Nepali month of Kartik as per the lunar calendar). Cows are worshipped as Mata or Mother in Hindu faith. The Gai Puja and Govardhan Puja rituals include making replicas of the Gai and Govardhan Mountain out of the cow dung. People prepare a mixture of the cow dung and ochre formed into a paste and apply on the courtyard of their houses and on the floors. Furthermore, the cultural significance of cows is underscored by their status as the national animal, recognized not only for their highly nutritious milk but also for their important role in agriculture and the ecosystem. Modern science also highlights the importance of local cow breeds as their milk is highly nutritious and is believed to enhance human vitality. As a part of the Gai Puja rituals, cows are fed with sweets and delicacies on this day. While cow worship is observed in some regions and communities on Kartik Shukla Aushi, there is a Vedic belief that the worship should be performed at the end of Aushi or the beginning of Pratipada (new moon day) as per the lunar calendar, said theological expert Prof Dr Ram Chandra Gautam. While performing Gai Puja, there is the tradition of tying the sacred thread on the tail of the cow that which was tied around one's wrist on Janai Poornima festival. By doing so, it is believed, that the cow would help the person's soul cross the Baitarani River, a mythical river, to heaven, after the person's death.","gai, puja, govardhan, cow, the, vedic, aunshi, janai, poornima, day, milk, kartik, worship, prof, rituals, moon, river, gautam, krishna, tradition"

There is a chance of heavy rain in one or two places in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces, as well as storms in some areas of Tarai. Additionally, the Department of Water and Meteorology reports that it has been raining continuously in eastern Nepal for 30 hours as of Friday afternoon. The rains have had an impact on people's lives all over the country. Officials have warned that natural disasters may occur as a result of the ongoing rains. Flights were unable to operate in mountainous areas on Friday, and various highways throughout the country were closed due to floods and landslides. Flights at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) remained disrupted today due to inclement weather. According to the TIA office, flights to both domestic and international destinations were affected. Domestic flights to Janakpur, Bhairahawa, Nepalgunj, and Dhangadhi are currently operational, according to TIA spokesperson Rinji Sherpa. Today's flights to Bhadrapur, Simara, Bharatpur, Pokhara, and Surkhet were cancelled. Two planes, including Indigo Airlines en route to Kathmandu from New Delhi, India and Thai Air from Bangkok, Thailand, were held for approximately an hour in preparation for international flights. It resulted in some international flights being delayed. However, the flights are now on a regular schedule. Mud deposition has, on the other hand, disrupted the Naubise-Nagdhunga road section of the Tribhuvan highway. Following incessant rain, the road was blocked by a mudflow from above the road near the tunnel way in Dhunibesi Municipality-9, causing traffic to come to a standstill. All types of vehicles, including passenger buses departing Kathmandu for various destinations, were stranded. The Traffic Police Office in Gajuri stated that it has been difficult to clear the mud that has accumulated on the road due to the continuous rain. On Thursday, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority issued a notice requesting that people avoid travelling unless absolutely necessary. The authority has requested that no night buses be run in hilly and hilly districts on Friday and Saturday. According to the Nepal Police, while the country's major highways are operational, the BP highway, one of the main routes leading east from Kathmandu, has been closed since Friday morning. According to the police, the highway was blocked due to landslides in Kavre's Roshi Rural Municipality. Similarly, the highway connecting Hetauda and Pharping is closed due to landslides in Makwanpur's Phakhel. According to traffic police, the Kanti Highway connecting Hetauda and Lalitpur is also blocked due to landslides in Thingan, Makwanpur. Traffic on the East-West Highway in Nawalpur has been hampered. However, the police stated that the road was not blocked. Manpower has been made available at the location. According to Nepal Police, equipment such as dozers is also on standby to clear the highway if it becomes blocked. Despite the fact that landslides have occurred in several locations, no human casualties have been reported so far. According to Ujjwal Upadhyay, a Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction Expert, monsoon clouds are now affecting the entire country. ""Friday and Saturday, it will rain across the country, except for the Sudurpaschim region; most areas of the country are expected to experience moderate to heavy rainfall today and tomorrow,"" he said. ""There is a high risk of flooding, landslides, and inundation, so riverbanks and landslide-prone areas should be prioritised. It is advisable not to travel on hilly highways today and tomorrow. The weather is expected to clear completely by Sunday morning.""","the, flights, highway, rain, risk, mud, highways, police, reduction, areas, valley, kanti, rinji, rains, rivers, roshi, traffic, riverbanks, municipality, buses"

Vietnam's VNExpress newspaper reported that 197 people have died and 128 are still missing, while more than 800 have been injured. In the capital, flood waters from the Red River receded slightly but many areas were still inundated. In Hanoi's Tay Ho district, people waded through muddy brown water above their knees to make their way along one street, some still wearing their bicycle and motorcycle helmets after abandoning their vehicles along the way. A few paddled along the road in small boats as empty water bottles, a stryofoam cooler and other flotsam drifted by; one man pushed his motorbike toward drier ground in an aluminum sloop. Pedestrians hiked up their shorts as high as possible to avoid being soaked by the wake caused by a delivery truck powering its way through the water. Yagi was the strongest typhoon to hit the Southeast Asian country in decades. It made landfall Saturday with winds of up to 149 kph (92 mph). Despite weakening on Sunday, downpours continued and rivers remain dangerously high. The flooding in Hanoi has been reportedly the worst in two decades, and has led to widespread evacuations. The death toll spiked earlier in the week as a flash flood swept away the entire hamlet of Lang Nu in northern Vietnam's Lao Cai province Tuesday. Hundreds of rescue personnel worked tirelessly Wednesday to search for survivors, but as of Thursday morning 53 villagers remained missing, VNExpress reported, while seven more bodies were found, bringing the death toll there to 42. Floods and landslides have caused most of the deaths, many of which have come in the northwestern Lao Cai province, bordering China, where Lang Nu is located. Lao Cai province is also home to the popular trekking destination of Sapa. On Monday, a bridge collapsed and a bus was swept away by flooding, killing dozens of people. The steel bridge in Phu Tho province over the engorged Red River collapsed, sending 10 cars and trucks along with two motorbikes into the river. The bus carrying 20 people was swept into a flooded stream by a landslide in mountainous Cao Bang province. Experts say storms like Typhoon Yagi are getting stronger due to climate change, as warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel them, leading to higher winds and heavier rainfall.","cai, lao, typhoon, river, hanoi, toll, province, vietnam, the, tay, tho, phu, cao, bang, aftermath, flash, death, waters, red, flood"

Flood waters from the swollen Red River in the capital, Hanoi, were beginning to recede, but many neighborhoods remained inundated and farther north experts were predicting it could still be days before any relief is in sight. Typhoon Yagi made landfall Saturday, starting a week of heavy rains that have triggered flash floods and landslides, particularly in Vietnam's mountainous north. Across Vietnam, 103 people are still listed as missing and more than 800 have been injured. Most fatalities have come in the province of Lao Cai, where a flash flood swept away the entire hamlet of Lang Nu on Tuesday. Eight villagers turned up safe on Friday morning, telling others that they had left before the deluge, state-run VNExpress newspaper reported, but 48 others from Lang Nu have been found dead, and another 39 remain missing. Roads to Lang Nu have been badly damaged, making it impossible to bring in heavy equipment to aid in the rescue effort. Some 500 personnel with sniffer dogs are on hand, and in a visit to the scene on Thursday, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh promised they would not relent in their search for those still missing. ""Their families are in agony,"" Chinh said. Coffins were stacked near the disaster site in preparation for the worst, and villager Tran Thi Ngan mourned at a makeshift altar for family members she had lost. ""It's a disaster,"" she told VTV news. ""That's the fate we have to accept."" In Cao Bang, another northern province bordering China, 21 bodies had been recovered by Friday, four days after a landslide pushed a bus, a car and several motorcycles into a small river, swollen with floodwaters. Ten more people remain missing. Experts say storms like Typhoon Yagi are getting stronger due to climate change, as warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel them, leading to higher winds and heavier rainfall. The effects of the typhoon, the strongest to hit Vietnam in decades, were also being felt across the region, with flooding and landslides in northern Thailand, Laos and northeastern Myanmar. In Thailand, 10 deaths have been reported due to flooding or landslides, and Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra flew to the north on Friday to visit affected people in the border town of Mae Sai. Thailand's Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation warned of a continuing risk of flash floods in multiple areas through Wednesday, as new rain was expected to increase the Mekong River's levels further. International aid has been flowing into Vietnam in the aftermath of Yagi, with Australia already delivering humanitarian supplies as part of $2 million in assistance. South Korea has also pledged $2 million in humanitarian aid, and the U.S. Embassy said Friday it would provide $1 million in support through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. ""With more heavy rain forecast in the coming days, USAID's disaster experts continue to monitor humanitarian needs in close coordination with local emergency authorities and partners on the ground,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""USAID humanitarian experts on the ground are participating in ongoing assessments to ensure U.S. assistance rapidly reaches populations in need."" The typhoon and ensuing heavy rains have damaged factories in northern provinces like Haiphong, home to electric car company VinFast, Apple parts suppliers and other electronic manufacturers, which could affect international supply chains, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a research note. ""Though 95 percent of businesses operating in Haiphong were expected to resume some activity on September 10, repair efforts will likely lower output for the next weeks and months,"" CSIS said.","typhoon, disaster, river, the, experts, tran, mekong, ngan, thi, humanitarian, minh, pham, chinh, international, paetongtarn, shinawatra, usaid, hanoi, north, embassy"

Vietnamese state broadcaster VTV said the torrent of water gushing down from a mountain in Lao Cai province Tuesday buried Lang Nu hamlet with 35 families in mud and debris. Only about a dozen are known so far to have survived. Rescuers have recovered 22 bodies and are continuing the search for about 70 others. The death toll from Typhoon Yagi and its aftermath has climbed to 141. Another 69 people are missing and hundreds were injured, VTV said. Floods and landslides have caused most of the deaths, many of which have come in the northwestern Lao Cai province, bordering China, where Lang Nu is located. Lao Cai province is also home to the popular trekking destination of Sapa. Many roads in the province were blocked by landslides and unrelenting rainfall, said Sapa tour guide Van A Po. The weather has forced them to limit travel with all trekking suspended. ""It is very scary,"" he said. Tourism is a key engine for the local economy, and many in the industry found themselves stranded. Nguyen Van Luong, who works in a hotel, said he couldn't return home since the 15-kilometer (9-mile) road from Sapa to his village was too dangerous to drive. ""The road is badly damaged and landslides could happen anytime. My family told me to stay here until it's safer to go home."" On Monday, a bridge collapsed and a bus was swept away by flooding, killing dozens of people.

Nine people died on Saturday after Typhoon Yagi made landfall in Vietnam before weakening into a tropical depression. The rest died in the floods and landslides that followed on Sunday and Monday, state media VN Express reported. The water levels of several rivers in northern Vietnam were dangerously high. A bus carrying 20 people was swept into a flooded stream by a landslide in mountainous Cao Bang province on Monday morning. State media said four bodies were recovered from the bus and one person was rescued alive. The others were still missing. In Phu Tho province, rescue operations were continuing after a steel bridge over the engorged Red River collapsed Monday morning. Reports said 10 cars and trucks along with two motorbikes fell into the river. Some people were pulled out of the river and taken to a hospital, but at least 10 people were still missing. Nguyen Minh Hai, who fell into the flooded river, told state Vietnam Television, ""I was so scared when I fell down. I felt like I've just escaped death. I can't swim and I thought I would die."" Pham Truong Son, 50, told VN Express that he was driving on the bridge on his motorcycle when he heard a loud noise. Before he knew what was happening, he was falling into the river. ""I felt like I was drowning at the bottom of the river,"" Son told the news outlet, adding that he managed to swim and hold on to a drifting banana tree to stay afloat before he was rescued. Dozens of businesses in Haiphong province haven't resumed production because of extensive damage to their factories, state newspaper Lao Dong reported. It said the roofs of several factories were blown apart and water seeped inside, damaging finished goods and expensive equipment. Some companies said they still didn't have electricity on Monday and that it would take at least a month to resume production. Parts of Haiphong and Quang Ninh provinces were still without power on Monday. The two provinces are industrial hubs, housing many factories that export goods, including EV maker VinFast and Apple suppliers Pegatrong and USI. Authorities are still assessing the damage to factories, but initial estimates showed that nearly 100 enterprises were damaged, resulting in millions of dollars in losses, the newspaper reported. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh visited Haiphong city on Sunday and approved a $4.62 million package to help the port city recover. Typhoon Yagi was the strongest typhoon to hit Vietnam in decades when it made landfall Saturday with winds up to 149 kph (92 mph). It weakened Sunday, but the country's meteorological agency warned that continuing downpours could cause floods and landslides. On Sunday, a landslide killed six people including an infant and injured nine others in Sapa town, a popular trekking base known for its terraced rice fields and mountains. Overall, state media reported 21 deaths and at least 299 people injured from the weekend. Skies were overcast in the capital, Hanoi, with occasional rain Monday morning as workers cleared uprooted trees, fallen billboards and toppled electricity poles. Heavy rain continued in northwestern Vietnam and forecasters said it could exceed 40 centimeters (15 inches) in places. Yagi also damaged agricultural land. Before hitting Vietnam, Yagi caused at least 20 deaths in the Philippines last week and four deaths in southern China. Chinese authorities said infrastructure losses across Hainan island province amounted to $102 million with 57,000 houses collapsed or damaged, power and water outages and roads damaged or impassable due to fallen trees. Yagi made a second landfall in Guangdong, a mainland province neighboring Hainan, on Friday night.

The disaster, which likely originated from the outburst of one of the many glaciers in the region's high altitudes, struck the Thame area around 1:25 PM. Thame village, located in Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality-5, sits in a valley that was overwhelmed by sudden floodwaters and debris flow. According to Laxman Adhikari, Ward Chair of Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality-4, the exact cause of the flood remains unclear. ""There are a couple of glaciers about a two-hour walk above the valley, but due to harsh conditions, it is currently impossible to investigate the source of the outburst,"" Adhikari explained. Locals speculate that rainfall at higher altitudes may have triggered the glacial outburst. ""We will investigate the exact cause of the flooding in the next few days when the situation normalizes,"" Adhikari added. The floodwaters, carrying a heavy load of mud and debris, surged down the mountainside with a deafening roar, giving villagers just enough time to flee to safer, higher ground. Fortunately, the incident occurred during the day. Had it happened at night, human casualties would likely have been unavoidable. Although no lives were lost, about 50% of the village has been severely damaged, and the remaining houses are uninhabitable. Police said that a school, a health clinic, seven houses and five hotels have been swept away by the disaster. Thame village, home to 45 households, is renowned for its association with legendary climbers, including Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, Apa Sherpa, Kami Rita Sherpa, and Lakpa Rita Sherpa. However, due to the off-season for tourism, there were very few people in the village, and they managed to flee to higher ground. ""Luckily, it's the off-season for tourism, so the area was relatively empty, which likely prevented any loss of life,"" Adhikari observed. The villagers who fled to higher altitudes left all their belongings behind in the valley. They are now awaiting rescue under open skies, with nothing but the clothes on their backs in the harsh weather. However, adverse weather continues to hinder rescue operations. ""The weather is unfavorable, resulting in delays in rescue efforts,"" Adhikari noted, adding that the village is without electricity and internet connectivity. Although a Nepali Army barrack is within a half-hour's walking distance, authorities were initially unable to establish contact with military personnel, he added. An emergency meeting of the District Disaster Management Committee was held in Salleri to coordinate rescue operations and determine the next steps. In the late afternoon, it was decided to first dispatch a helicopter from Phaplu Airport with Armed Police Force personnel to the disaster area. Meanwhile, Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality also attempted to dispatch a helicopter from Kathmandu, carrying rescue personnel to the disaster site, Adhikari said. Additionally, a team of Nepali Army personnel was ready to be flown in from Itahari to conduct rescue and post-disaster management efforts, though poor weather has caused delays in their arrival. After multiple delays, rescue efforts faced further setbacks as the helicopter dispatched from Kathmandu was unable to reach the district due to bad weather and had to return to Kathmandu, and the Nepali Army helicopter from Itahari couldn't take off. Meanwhile, the helicopter with APF personnel was also grounded due to the adverse weather. ""With the worsening weather and the passing hours, it's unlikely that any helicopter will be able to fly to the disaster area today,"" Adhikari informed. Authorities have urged settlements along the Dudhkoshi River to relocate to safer locations. The increased water flow in the Dudhkoshi River poses a potential threat to nearby settlements, warned the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) in its first alert issued at 2:30 pm. NDRRMA issued a second alert at 5:45 PM, notifying residents that the water level in the Dudhkoshi River had risen, according to the Rabuwabazar water level measuring center. The alert warned that the water level had crossed the alert threshold and urged everyone to stay safe and remain vigilant until further notice. Security personnel have already been deployed to the site from Namche, the district headquarters, though the incident site is approximately five hours' walking distance from Namche, according to the District Administration Office, Solukhumbu. According to authorities, by late afternoon, a team of Nepali Army personnel deployed to the incident site had rescued seven people from the flood. However, it has been reported that at least one person is still missing in the disaster area.","the, disaster, weather, personnel, alert, helicopter, lhamu, district, outburst, sherpa, municipality, pasang, rescue, walking, hour, management, army, altitudes, flood, rita"

A team of experts and authorities had been dispatched to inspect and monitor the disaster site and investigate the cause of the sudden flood and mudslide that struck the village. Following an aerial inspection on Saturday morning, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality confirmed that the flood was triggered by the outburst of a glacial lake, one of the many lakes situated above the valley. The municipality has also said that there is no further risk of flash floods or mudslides from this particular outburst. In response to the disaster, a Nepali Army team was deployed to the site, rescuing several villagers. Police personnel have also arrived at the scene to initiate rescue and rehabilitation operations. The Minister for Defence, Man Bir Rai, along with federal and provincial assembly members, rural municipality chairs, and the Chief District Officer of Solukhumbu, had reached Thame village on Saturday morning for an on-site inspection of the flood-affected areas. On Friday several attempts to fly helicopters from Kathmandu, Itahari and Phaplu Airport for rescue operation and inspection of the flood-affected areas had failed due to the adverse weather.The sudden flood on Friday afternoon caused significant damage, affecting nearly half of the village. Thame village, home to 45 households, is renowned for its association with legendary climbers, including Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, Apa Sherpa, Kami Rita Sherpa, and Lakpa Rita Sherpa. Fortunately, as the incident occurred during the day and not at night, there were no human casualties. Due to the off-season for tourism, there were very few people in the village, and they managed to flee to higher ground. Authorities reported that around 93 villagers who fled to higher altitudes or were rescued are now being sheltered in an army camp, while 42 others have been temporarily placed in a nearby community building. Police have stated that a school, a health clinic, and 15 houses have been completely damaged by the flood. Monetary assistance of Rs 50,000 has been provided to each of the 15 households whose homes were completely destroyed, with Rs 15,000 per household by the rural municipality and the District Disaster Rescue Committee. Additionally, Rs 10,000 has been given to 31 households partially affected by the flood, with further relief to be distributed as more affected households are identified and categorized, the rural municipality added. Although the water level in the Thame River has decreased, it continues to pose a threat to settlements along its banks in the Khumbu and lower Solu areas. The local power project's powerhouse was completely damaged, and 200 meters of the trekking route from Phakding to Namche, specifically in the Jame area, has been washed away. Additionally, the Mapya-Khumbu Friendship Bridge over the Dudhkoshi River, connecting Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality and Mapyadudhkoshi Rural Municipality, was damaged by the floods, forcing authorities to relocate five families in Mapyadudhkoshi Rural Municipality-6 to a safer location. The direct road network from Salleri to Khumbu has been disrupted.The flood has also hindered movement to areas above Namche in Solukhumbu, cutting off the tourist route from Phakding to Namche and access to the Everest region. Former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' urged the government to spare no efforts in rescue and relief operations, emphasizing the vulnerability of mountain communities to climate change. Taking to social media, Dahal said that Human lives in mountainous regions are increasingly vulnerable due to the severe impacts of climate change. ""Natural calamities, such as landslides & floods, along with the continuous melting of mountains & glaciers, pose perennial threats to our communities & natural resources."" ""We are facing consequences for a problem for which we are not responsible. I have strongly raised this issue at the UNGA and COP28, calling for climate justice. The recent GLOFs in Thame in the Everest region, have caused significant damage and put lives at risk,"" Dahal added. ""I urge the government to provide swift relief to those affected and call on the international community to increase support to protect Nepal from climate-related risks."" Experts from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) have raised concerns about the irreversible changes occurring in the glaciers, snow, and permafrost in the Himalayan region. According to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), several glacial lakes lie upstream of Thame. Satellite images of the area dating back to 2017 obtained by ICIMOD from the European Space Agency's Copernicus earth observation programme show these lakes constantly changing in size. Researchers at ICIMOD confirm that some of them frequently expand and contract, making them susceptible to breaches. These lakes lie near the popular trekking destination of Tashi Lapcha Pass. The neighbouring valley holds one of the region's most potentially dangerous glacial lakes, Tsho Rolpa, ICIMOD added. It warns floods and landslides are projected to increase, with climate the key driver in many of the water- and cryosphere-related disasters already recorded in recent years, through meltwater, larger and more potentially dangerous lakes, unstable slopes from thawing permafrost, and increasing sediment loads in rivers. The Solukhumbu District Administration Office later confirmed that the flood in Thame was caused by the outburst of two glacial lakes among the five located above the area. The office added that while one of the remaining lakes is safe, the other two are still at risk of bursting. Similarly, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology attributed the glacial lake outburst in Thame to climate change and rising temperatures. According to the department, the daily average temperature in the Thame area began increasing on August 9, rising from 9.7 degrees Celsius to 11 degrees Celsius. On the day of the flood, the temperature spiked to 15 degrees Celsius. The department explained that the outburst was triggered by this temperature rise combined with continuous rainfall. Tenzing Chogyal Sherpa, ICIMOD Cryosphere Analyst and founder of the #SaveOurSnow campaign, is from the Solukhumbu region where the floods hit. ""This flood swept away parts of a village I know intimately well, where friends, neighbours and relatives live, with ancestral ties going back generations,"" he said. ""It is a painfully personal reminder of the devastating impacts of temperature rise on mountain communities. Millions of people in the mountains have contributed literally nothing to greenhouse gas emissions, but face the catastrophic impacts of these emissions with ever-increasing frequency and severity. ""Climate change is a crime scene. The glaciers are making it visible. We cannot look the other way,"" said Miriam Jackson, Cryosphere lead for ICIMOD.","the, lakes, glacial, municipality, flood, degrees, rural, khumbu, lhamu, lake, mapyadudhkoshi, outburst, pasang, temperature, cryosphere, sherpa, climate, rescue, households, celsius"

The flood affected households were provided Rs 50,000 from the local levels and Rs 15,000 from district disaster rescue committee. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Man Bir Rai has reached the flood-hit Khumbu village. He is also accompanied by Sonam Sherpa, Chairperson of Federalism Strengthening and National Concern Committee of the federal parliament. Minister Rai and Chairperson Sherpa directed the local level and authorities to carry out rescue and relief works effectively. A total of twenty houses including those having a hotel, a clinic and a school building were damaged by the sudden flood in the Thame rivulet. Entire village has turned into a mass of debris. Chairperson Sherpa informed that the National Disaster Reduction and Management Authority was informed on the urgency of resettling the households displaced from the flood. A total of 100 people are displaced by the disaster. The Nepali Army, Nepal Police and people's representatives at local level are at work to extend assistance to the needy people. Even a bridge was damaged by the sudden flood. The flood hit area is 7-km away from a popular 'three pass' trekking route to Namche. Following the flood that damaged a bridge and a trail in at least two places, the connection to trekking route is cut off. The locals had guessed that among four glacial lakes, one was burst, causing the flashflood. Lawmaker Sherpa viewed all three-tiers of government could work in unison for safe relocation of the affected people.","flood, disaster, rai, the, sherpa, bir, khumbu, committee, hit, trekking, households, route, flashflood, rivulet, bridge, people, lhamu, relocation, sonam, village"

Pasang Namgya Sherpa, 53, has now become the only Nepali climber to scale all 14 peaks above 8,000m and two rarely climbed mountains - Lhotse Shar and Yalung Khang. Hundreds of people gathered at the Tribhuvan International Airport offering a hero's welcome to Sherpa. ""Pasang Namgyal has now become the first Nepali climber to successfully scale all 16 peaks above 8,000m,"" Managing Director at Imagine Nepal Treks Mingma G said while receiving the climber at the Tribhuvan International Airport. Mingma G heralded his achievement as unparalleled. Sherpa's latest summit was recorded as he scaled Broad Peak in Pakistan on July 27, registering successful ascent of 14 of the highest summits in the world. Sherpa has already climbed two more peaks – Lhotse Sar (8,400m) and Yalung Khang (8,505m). Director at the Department of Tourism Rakesh Gurung, Senior Vice President of Nepal Mountaineering Association Thakur Raj Pandey, NMA and government officials, as well as scores of well-wishers honoured Sherpa upon his arrival. Speaking on the occasion, DoT's Director Gurung said that efforts were underway to frame a climbing-friendly tourism Act in the country. ""Pasang Namgyal's success reflects the brevity of Nepali climbers,"" he added. Gurung applauded Sherpa for his exceptional achievements. NMA's senior vice president Pandey asked the government to honour climbing Sherpas and address their demands at the earliest. ""Climbers' welfare fund is the need of the hour,"" he said, adding that Sherpas are the backbone of mountain climbing. Senior climbing guide from Imagine Nepal Treks, Pasang Namgyal, also known as the ""Himalayan Tiger,"" is a legendary Nepalese climber who frequently climbed with veteran Korean climbers. He earned the nickname ""Himalayan Tiger"" from the Koreans due to his bravery and ferocity in the mountains.

Everest, Pasang Lhamu Sherpa. ""Pasang Lhamu Sherpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and now has a crater named for her on the summit of an important lunar South Pole mountain,"" the USGS announced. The announcement was made after the International Astronomical Union, the internationally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies and their surface features, approved the name of the crater as 'Lhamu Crater' on July 29. ""On behalf of the Pasang Lhamu Sherpa family, we would like to thank the USGS/IAU for naming a crater 'Lhamu' on the Moon's South Pole,"" Pasang Lhamu's husband, Lhakpa Sonam Sherpa, said. On April 22, 1993, Pasang Lhamu created mountaineering history by becoming the first Nepalese woman to successfully scale the world's highest peak. While descending, the climbers were hit with bad weather. She died on the descent near the south summit on Mt. Everest. In Nepal, the government has already declared Pasang Lhamu a National Luminary of the country and has named the Jasamba Mountain (7,315m) in the Mahalangur Range as Pasang Lhamu Mountain. The 117 km-long highway from Trishuli to Dhunche has also been named Pasang Lhamu Highway.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-and-tech/private-lunar-lander-may-have-fallen-over-while-touching-down-near-the-moons-south-pole,Private lunar lander may have fallen over while touching down near the moon's south pole,Associated Press,2025-03-07 20:52:41,"CAPE CANAVERAL, MARCH 7 A privately owned lunar lander touched down on the moon with a drill, drone and rovers for NASA and other customers Thursday, but quickly ran into trouble and may have fallen over. Intuitive Machines said it was uncertain whether its Athena lander was upright near the moon's south pole - standing 15 feet (4.7 meters) tall - or lying sideways like its first spacecraft from a year ago. Controllers rushed to turn off some of the lander's equipment to conserve power while trying to determine what went wrong. It was the second moon landing this week by a Texas company under NASA's commercial lunar delivery program. Sunday's touchdown was a complete success. Intuitive Machines' newest Athena lander dropped out of lunar orbit as planned. The hourlong descent appeared to go well until the final approach when the laser navigation system began acting up. It took a while for Mission Control to confirm touchdown. ""We're on the surface,"" reported mission director and co-founder Tim Crain. A few minutes later, he repeated, ""It looks like we're down ... We are working to evaluate exactly what our orientation is on the surface."" Hours after the landing, Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus there was conflicting data about how Athena landed and whether it was on its side. The lander was near the intended target site, but a sweep by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in the coming days will confirm its position and orientation, he said. Launched last week, Athena was communicating with controllers more than 230,000 miles (375,000 kilometers) away and generating solar power, officials said. Mission managers worked to salvage the mission to see whether the drill can be turned on and the drone can be deployed to hop into a crater. ""Obviously, without knowing the exact orientation of the lander, it's hard to say exactly what science we will and will not be able to do,"" said NASA's top science officer Nicky Fox. Intuitive Machines last year put the U.S. back on the moon despite its lander tipping on its side. On Sunday, Firefly Aerospace became the first private entity to achieve complete success with its Blue Ghost lunar lander, on the northeastern edge of the near side of the moon. A vacuum already has collected lunar dirt for analysis and a dust shield has shaken off the abrasive particles that cling to everything. Intuitive Machines was aiming this time for a mountain plateau just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole, much closer than before. It reached the plateau, but Intuitive Machines was not sure how near it was to the precise targeted spot. This week's back-to-back moon landings are part of NASA's commercial lunar delivery program meant to get the space agency's experiments to the gray, dusty surface and jumpstart business. The commercial landers are also seen as scouts for the astronauts who will follow later this decade under NASA's Artemis program, the successor to Apollo. NASA officials said before the landing that they knew going in that some of the low-cost missions would fail. But with more private missions to the moon, that increased the number of experiments getting there. NASA spent tens of millions of dollars on the ice drill and two other instruments riding on Athena, and paid an additional $62 million for the lift. Most of the experiments were from private companies, including the two rovers. The rocket-powered drone came from Intuitive Machines - it's meant to hop into a permanently shadowed crater near the landing site in search of frozen water. To lower costs even more, Intuitive Machines shared its SpaceX rocket launch with three spacecraft that went their separate ways. Two of them - NASA's Lunar Trailblazer and AstroForge's asteroid-chasing Odin - are in jeopardy. NASA said this week that Lunar Trailblazer is spinning without radio contact and won't reach its intended orbit around the moon for science observations. Odin is also silent, with its planned asteroid flyby unlikely. As for Athena, Intuitive Machines made dozens of repairs and upgrades following the company's sideways touchdown by its first lander. It still managed to operate briefly, ending America's moon-landing drought of more than 50 years. Until then, the U.S. had not landed on the moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. No one else has sent astronauts to the moon, the overriding goal of NASA's Artemis program. And only four other countries have successfully landed robotic spacecraft on the moon: Russia, China, India and Japan.","lander, lunar, nasa, the, moon, landing, mission, athena, intuitive, spacecraft, drill, machines, its, pole, crain, orbiter, reconnaissance, plateau, asteroid, crater"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-and-tech/private-lunar-lander-blue-ghost-touches-down-on-the-moon-with-a-special-delivery-for-nasa,Private lunar lander Blue Ghost touches down on the moon with a special delivery for NASA,Associated Press,2025-03-02 17:20:15,"CAPE CANAVERAL, MARCH 2 A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions. Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon's northeastern edge of the near side. Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away. ""You all stuck the landing. We're on the moon,"" Firefly's Will Coogan, chief engineer for the lander, reported. An upright and stable landing makes Firefly - a startup founded a decade ago - the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. A half hour after landing, Blue Ghost started to send back pictures from the surface, the first one a selfie somewhat obscured by the sun's glare. Two other companies' landers are hot on Blue Ghost's heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week. Blue Ghost - named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies - had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company. Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It's the third mission under NASA's commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade. The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down. It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust - a scourge for NASA's long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment. On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers. The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business. Another lander - a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines - is due to land on the moon Thursday. It's aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That's closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over. Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972. A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023. The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades. NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realizing some missions will fail, said the space agency's top science officer Nicky Fox. Unlike NASA's successful Apollo moon landings that had billions of dollars behind them and ace astronauts at the helm, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim. Kim said everything went like clockwork.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-and-tech/private-company-rockets-toward-the-moon-in-the-latest-rush-of-lunar-landing-attempts,Private company rockets toward the moon in the latest rush of lunar landing attempts,Associated Press,2025-02-27 22:20:06,"CAPE CANAVERAL, FEBRUARY 27 A private company launched another lunar lander Wednesday, aiming to get closer to the moon's south pole this time with a drone that will hop into a jet-black crater that never sees the sun. Intuitive Machines' lander, named Athena, caught a lift with SpaceX from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. It's taking a fast track to the moon - with a landing on March 6 - while hoping to avoid the fate of its predecessor, which tipped over at touchdown. Never before have so many spacecraft angled for the moon's surface all at once. Last month, U.S. and Japanese companies shared a rocket and separately launched landers toward Earth's sidekick. Texas-based Firefly Aerospace should get there first this weekend after a big head start. The two US landers are carrying tens of millions of dollars' worth of experiments for NASA as it prepares to return astronauts to the moon. ""It's an amazing time. There's so much energy,"" NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox told The Associated Press a few hours ahead of the launch. This isn't Intuitive Machines' first lunar rodeo. Last year, the Texas company made the first U.S. touchdown on the moon in more than 50 years. But an instrument that gauges distance did not work and the lander came down too hard and broke a leg, tipping onto its side. Intuitive Machines said it has fixed the issue and dozens of others. A sideways landing like last time would prevent the drone and a pair of rovers from moving out. NASA's drill also needs an upright landing to pierce beneath the lunar surface to gather soil samples for analysis. ""Certainly, we will be better this time than we were last time. But you never know what could happen,"" said Trent Martin, senior vice president of space systems. It's an extraordinarily elite club. Only five countries have pulled off a lunar landing over the decades: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. The moon is littered with wreckage from many past failures. The 15-foot (4.7-meter) Athena will target a landing 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the lunar south pole. Just a quarter-mile (400 meters) away is a permanently shadowed crater - the ultimate destination for the drone named Grace. Named after the late computer programming pioneer Grace Hopper, the 3-foot (1-meter) drone will make three increasingly higher and longer test hops across the lunar surface using hydrazine fueled-thrusters for flight and cameras and lasers for navigation. If those excursions go well, it will hop into the nearby pitch-black crater, an estimated 65 feet (20 meters) deep. Science instruments from Hungary and Germany will take measurements at the bottom while hunting for frozen water. It will be the first up-close peek inside one of the many shadowed craters dotting both the north and south poles. Scientists suspect these craters are packed with tons of ice. If so, this ice could be transformed by future explorers into water to drink, air to breathe and even rocket fuel. NASA is paying $62 million to Intuitive Machines to get its drill and other experiments to the moon. The company, in turn, sold space on the lander to others. It also opened up the Falcon rocket to ride-sharing. Tagalongs included NASA's Lunar Trailblazer satellite, which will fly separately to the moon over the next several months before entering lunar orbit to map the distribution of water below. Also catching a ride was a private spacecraft that will chase after an asteroid for a flyby, a precursor to asteroid mining.","lunar, landing, the, nasa, meter, moon, lander, crater, intuitive, foot, machines, space, drone, craters, asteroid, company, firefly, nicky, trailblazer, fox"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/the-year-of-the-snake-is-underway-with-lunar-new-year-festivities-around-the-world,The Year of the Snake is underway with Lunar New Year festivities around the world,Associated Press,2025-01-29 20:39:34,"BEIJING, JANUARY 29 Firecrackers popped, incense was offered at temples and dancers and drummers paraded Wednesday in Asia and farther afield as millions around the world celebrated the Lunar New Year. From Beijing to Havana, the holiday - known as the Spring Festival in China, Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in Korea - is a major festival celebrated in many countries. Wednesday marked the start of the Year of the Snake, one of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac. Throngs of people in down jackets filled a Beijing park for a ""temple fair"" on a sunny but chilly day. Some rang bells and tossed coins into containers in the shape of gold bars for good luck, while others ate traditional snacks from food stalls and took photos with a person dressed up as the God of Wealth. The Lunar New Year is a time to wish for good luck and prosperity in the coming year for oneself and others. ""The past year was a very busy one for me, because I had to take care of both my kid and my work,"" said Beijing resident Jiang Hecang. ""In the Year of the Snake, I wish my kid will grow healthily and my work can remain stable. Then I can be happy enough."" In Malaysia, the crackling of firecrackers greeted the new year outside Guan Di temple in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, followed by lion dances to the rhythmic beat of drums and small cymbals. Ethnic Chinese held incense sticks in front of them and bowed several times inside the temple before sticking the incense into elaborate gold-colored pots, the smoke rising from the burning tips. Hundreds of people lined up on the eve of the Lunar New Year at the Wong Tai Sin Taoist temple in Hong Kong in a bid to be among the first to put incense sticks in the stands in front of the temple's main hall at 11 p.m. ""I wish my family will be blessed. I hope my business will run well. I pray for my country and wish people peace. I hope this coming year is a better year,"" said Ming So, who visits the temple annually for the late-night ritual. Many Chinese who work in bigger cities return home during the eight-day national holiday in what is described as the world's biggest annual movement of humanity. The exodus turns Beijing, China's capital, into a bit of a ghost town, with many shops closed and normally crowded roads and subways emptied. Traditionally, Chinese have a family dinner at home on New Year's Eve. On the Lunar New Year, many visit temples to pray and attend temple fairs to watch performances and buy snacks, toys and other trinkets. ""I bring my children here to experience the atmosphere, because the New Year atmosphere ... is fading,"" Beijing resident Wang Xinxin said at a temple fair at Ditan Park, the former Temple of Earth in the Ming and Qing dynasties. ""Children like mine don't have much idea what New Year was like in Beijing before, but here we can still see some elements of it,"" Wang said. The government has curtailed non-official celebrations, with major cities outlawing the noisy firecrackers that once reverberated around Beijing and left some blocks enshrouded in smoke. Many Chinese take advantage of the extended holiday to travel in the country and abroad. Ctrip, an online booking agency that operates Trip.com, said the most popular overseas destinations this year are Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, the United States, South Korea, Macao and Vietnam. In Moscow, Russians cheered, waved and took smartphone photos of drummers, costumed dancers and long dragon and snake figures held aloft in a colorful procession that kicked off a 10-day Lunar New Year festival on Tuesday night. The Chinese and Russian governments have deepened ties since 2022, in part to push back against what they see as U.S. dominance of the world order. Visitors shouted ""Happy New Year"" in Russian and expressed delight at being able to experience Chinese food and culture in Moscow, including folk performances and booths selling snacks and artwork. Cuba's small Chinese community celebrated the Lunar New Year on Tuesday night with a parade of glowing lanterns and dragons winding their way through the narrow streets of Chinatown. The island was once home to one of the largest and oldest Chinese communities in the Americas. Now, a much smaller community celebrates major holidays with a Cuban twist, blending rum and cigars with traditional Chinese cuisine.","year, temple, the, snake, lunar, chinese, new, eve, firecrackers, my, beijing, xinxin, jiang, hecang, festival, incense, kid, day, wang, atmosphere"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/trump-wants-to-pull-the-us-out-of-the-world-health-organization-again-heres-what-may-happen-next,Trump wants to pull the US out of the World Health Organization again. Here's what may happen next,Associated Press,2025-01-21 11:41:26,"WASHINGTON, JANUARY 21 US President Donald Trump used one of the flurry of executive actions that he issued on his first day back in the White House to begin the process of withdrawing the US from the World Health Organization for the second time in less than five years - a move many scientists fear could roll back decades-long gains made in fighting infectious diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Experts have also cautioned that withdrawing from the organization could weaken the world's defenses against dangerous new outbreaks capable of triggering pandemics. Here's a look at what Trump's decision means: What happened? During the first Oval Office appearance of his second term, Trump signed an executive order detailing how the withdrawal process might begin. ""Ooh,"" Trump exclaimed as he was handed the action to sign. ""That's a big one!"" His move calls for pausing the future transfer of U.S. government funds to the organization, recalling and reassigning federal personnel and contractors working with the WHO and calls on officials to ""identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by"" the organization. This isn't the first time Trump has tried to sever ties with WHO. In July 2020, several months after WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic and as cases surged globally, Trump's administration officially notified U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the U.S. was planning to pull out of WHO, suspending funding to the agency. President Joe Biden reversed Trump's decision on his first day in office in January 2021 - only to have Trump essentially revive it on his first day back at the White House. Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of the advocacy group Resolve to Save Lives, said Trump's move ""makes Americans - and the world - less safe."" ""Withdrawing from WHO not only cuts crucial funding from the agency, but it also surrenders our role as a global health leader and silences America's voice in critical decisions affecting global health security,"" Frieden said in a statement. ""Real reform requires engagement, not abandonment. We cannot make WHO more effective by walking away from it. This decision weakens America's influence and increases the risk of a deadly pandemic."" What is WHO and does this really matter? It is the U.N.'s specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the world's response to global health threats, including outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries, helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer. ""A U.S. withdrawal from WHO would make the world far less healthy and safe,"" said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Global Health Law at Georgetown University. He said in an email that losing American resources would devastate WHO's global surveillance and epidemic response efforts. ""It would make it more likely that we could see novel diseases spinning out of control, crossing borders, and potentially sparking a pandemic,"" he said. Can Trump really withdraw the US from WHO? Yes, as long as he gets the approval of Congress and the U.S. meets its financial obligations to WHO for the current fiscal year. The U.S. joined WHO via a 1948 joint resolution passed by both chambers of Congress, which has subsequently been supported by all administrations. The resolution requires the U.S. to provide a one-year notice period should it decide to leave WHO. What does this mean for WHO? It's extremely bad. The U.S. has historically been among WHO's biggest donors, providing the U.N. health agency not only with hundreds of millions of dollars, but also hundreds of staffers with specialized public health expertise. In the last decade, the U.S. has given WHO about $160 million to $815 million every year. WHO's yearly budget is about $2 billion to $3 billion. Losing U.S. funding could cripple numerous global health initiatives, including the effort to eradicate polio, maternal and child health programs, and research to identify new viral threats. Numerous American agencies that work with WHO would also suffer, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. Leaving WHO would exclude the U.S. from WHO-coordinated initiatives, like determining the yearly composition of flu vaccines and missions to countries battling dangerous epidemics. American scientists would also lose quick access to critical genetic databases run by WHO, which could stall attempts to produce vaccines and medicines. Why is Trump withdrawing the US from WHO? At a September campaign rally, Trump said he would ""take on the corruption"" at WHO and other public health institutions that he said were ""dominated"" by corporate power and China. Trump has also said that the U.S. contributed far more to WHO than China did and complained that China ""totally controls"" the U.N. health agency. ""And now, they want to give control over our whole country to them, which would be a terrible mistake,"" he said. WHO typically issues advice to its member countries about how to handle health crises, but the agency has no authority to compel countries to act. In 2020, Trump alleged WHO was ""colluding"" with China to hide the extent of the coronavirus' spread in the early days of the pandemic. An AP investigation in June 2020 found that China withheld crucial details about the virus shortly after it emerged, frustrating WHO's efforts to assess its potential for danger and stop its spread. What has WHO said? ""We really believe in cooperation ... and from our side, we are ready to work together,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a December news conference. Tedros said the relationship between WHO and the U.S. ""has actually been a good model of partnership,"" saying he believed American leaders understand the U.S. cannot be safe from health threats unless the entire world is safe. He noted that when Ebola struck a war-torn part of Congo in 2018, no American first responders were involved. ""It was WHO and partners who help(ed) the (Congolese) government ... to contain that outbreak.""","health, the, global, trump, american, frieden, who, tedros, adhanom, ghebreyesus, institutes, vaccines, move, pandemic, threats, world, organization, spread, withdrawal, agency"

Meanwhile, in Mustang, preparations have neared completion for the celebration of the Yartung festival celebrated annually on the occasion of Janai Purnima, replacing feet with hooves. The festival scheduled from August 15 to 19 will hold a series of programmes and competitions, bringing in domestic and international tourists. As per locals, the Yartung tradition dates back to the first settlements in the region, when locals would celebrate the end of summer months, bringing people from all over the region together for worship, celebrations, horse races and archery competitions. Any unflattering comment about one's horses would and still leads to a competition on such occasions, which also showcases the deep connection between an owner and their horse, the locals shared. The festival is said to have been celebrated by the early kings of the then-divided states and is continued in the region with horses being an integral part of people's livelihood, Karma Gurung, a local entrepreneur, and proprietor of Chimley Orchards Pvt Ltd, shared adding that it is also believed to bring good luck when riding a horse during the occasion. ""Yartung is a combination of the local tongue - Yar and Tung, meaning 'summer' and 'farewell',"" Gurung explained. Horses and people of Mustang have been coexisting for over a thousand years and will continue to do so still. In the early days, people were said to flaunt their horses during the summer gathering and would even compete in races to see who had a better and faster horse. The tradition continues till this day. Now, each household has at least one horse and they are treated much like their own family members. According to Kesang Thokya Thakuri, chairman of Jana Priya Youth Club, Purang, the annual organiser of the festival, preparations for the festival have neared completion with a few adjustments yet to be made in the coming days. ""Horses were used as the main means of transportation, trade, and a source of income and are still considered so today and the tradition is as old as the earliest human settlement in the region,"" Gurung said, adding that owning a horse also signified status and wealth. Although many had stopped owning them, each household in the region owns at least one horse at present. While owning and taking care of one is already expensive itself, the price of a good strong horse can take up to over Rs 1.2 million and even more. Not inclusive to the locals, people aged 18 to 60 - including women - from any part of the country are welcome to participate in the races. ""The festival will kick off on August 15 with a blessing ceremony followed by the start of football competitions between surrounding villages and locals. Archery competition begins on August 16 and the following day will see the results of both the sports,"" Thakuri shared, adding that the following two days will be focused on horse races and cultural programmes. ""On August 18, horse racers will be called forth from 8:00am and the race will take place from 10:00am till late noon. The race track is around a five-kilometre dirt track starting from Chher Thanga to Ranipuawa Purang On the last and most important day of the festival on the occasion of Janai Purnima. Locals of Ranipauwa Purang, Jharkot, and Khinga start the day with a puja ceremony at the local monastery followed by cultural dances and horse procession to Muktinath Temple for worship. Locals also wear their ancestral clothes, beautify and feed their horses and make merry till the end. Various artists and musicians are also invited on the occasion to further add life throughout the end of the festival,"" he informed THT. With around 40 hotels established in Ranipauwa, around 1,000 people - both local tourists from surrounding regions and others including some foreigners - are expected to arrive in Mustang for the festival. Furthermore, stakeholders have called on all three tiers of the government to promote the Yartung, also one of the biggest horse festivals in the country to further attract a very large number of international and local audiences, fostering tourism activities and economy. ""While Mustang has huge prospects in terms of tourism, they are hindered due to a lack of programmes and promotional activities and mainly due to the sluggish progress on the road construction project connecting it. Although over 400,000 tourists visited the region in the last fiscal year, the rapid development of necessary infrastructure could further help boost the numbers,"" Gurung said, adding that with many hotels including the Shinta Mani Mustang (SMM), first luxury hotel located outside Kathmandu, which was also listed among the top 22 'best new hotels for 2024' in National Geographic's 'Best of the World' list, highlight the region's potential in the future. Mustang, a prime tourism destination renowned for its iconic landscapes, snow-capped and bare peaks, culture and lifestyle, and various sites of historical and religious importance welcomed around 427,000 domestic and international tourists in the fiscal year 2022-23, a significant increase compared to the previous fiscal when 379,767 tourists made their way there. The Ghasa Police Post, which tracks the entry of tourists and vehicles into Mustang via land routes, reported that 427,271 tourists arrived in 74,374 vehicles over the past year. Among them, 318,814 were domestic tourists, 99,276 were from SAARC countries, and 9,171 were from other countries.","horse, the, tourists, horses, yartung, archery, august, 427, shinta, purang, kilometre, races, tradition, around, 000, mani, summer, hotels, festival, local"

Russia said Ukrainian drones also hit an apartment building, killing one person. The uptick in attacks since July comes as Ukraine mounts pressure on allies to allow it to use long-range missiles to strike targets in Russia. Western allies, in particular the U.S., have so far resisted, fearing escalation from Moscow. Ukraine struck a Russian Kilo-class submarine and an S-400 anti aircraft missile complex in the Moscow-occupied Crimean peninsula, according to a statement from the General Staff on Saturday. The air defense system was established to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge, an important logistics and transport hub supplying Russian forces. Units of the missile forces, as well as the Navy, damaged four launchers of the Triumph air defense system, while in the port of Sevastopol, the ""Rostov-on-Don"" - a submarine of Russia's Black Sea fleet - was attacked and sank, the statement said. The General Staff also confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck the Morozovsk airfield in the Rostov region after launching a massive drone barrage on Russia. Hits were recorded in warehouses with ammunition, where guided aerial bombs were stored. The operation was carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine, the Main Directorate of Intelligence and the Defense Ministry, the statement said. Meanwhile, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said that a woman was killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on an apartment building in the town of Shebekino early Sunday. Ukrainian drones also damaged several other buildings in the town, he said. Gladkov said eight civilians have been wounded in the region by Ukrainian shelling and dozens of drone strikes since the previous day. In the span of a month, Russia has experienced a surge in the tempo of Ukrainian drone barrages and long-range attacks, targeting Russian military infrastructure, including airfields and oil depots. Analysts say such an intensification is needed if Ukraine is to degrade Russian capabilities. In other developments: Ukraine's human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said he has appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations to investigate a photo that allegedly shows the body of a Ukrainian prisoner of war tortured and executed by Russian forces. He has also asked Ukrainian authorities to verify the identity of the deceased. The photo, circulating on social media, shows the body of a person without a head or limbs. The Associated Press was unable to verify it. ""This is not just a violation of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, this is the behavior of monsters,"" Lubinets said in a statement on Telegram. ""We are aware of recent reports online and in the media. We take these reports extremely seriously. The way we work is to respond via relevant authorities directly and confidentially,"" Pat Griffiths, ICRC Spokesperson in Ukraine, told the Associated Press on Sunday when asked about Lubinet's request. ""Speaking generally, the law of armed conflict is clear.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/strikes-on-gaza-kill-12-and-stabbing-in-israel-kills-2-as-fears-of-wider-war-spike,Strikes on Gaza kill 12 and stabbing in Israel kills 2 as fears of wider war spike,Associated Press,2024-08-04 15:34:53,"TEL AVIV, AUGUST 4 Israeli strikes early Sunday killed 12 people in Gaza, including four who were sheltering in a tent camp for displaced people inside a hospital complex, while a stabbing attack carried out by a Palestinian killed two people in a Tel Aviv suburb. Tensions have soared following nearly 10 months of war in Gaza and the killing of two senior militants in separate strikes in Lebanon and Iran last week. Those killings brought threats of revenge from Iran and its allies and raised fears of an even more destructive regional war. A woman in her 70s and an 80-year-old man were killed in the stabbing attack, according to Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service and a nearby hospital, and two other men were wounded. The police said the attack was carried out by a Palestinian militant, who was ""neutralized,"" and that a search was underway for other suspects. The rescuers said the wounded were found in three different locations, each about 500 meters (yards) apart, adding to concerns that more than one assailant was involved. Israel has been bracing for retaliation after the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in an attack in Iran's capital last week. Both were linked to the ongoing war in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel. In Gaza, an Israeli strike earlier on Sunday hit a tent camp housing displaced people in the courtyard of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, killing four people, including one woman, and injuring others, Gaza's Health Ministry said. An Associated Press journalist filmed men rushing to the scene to help the wounded and retrieve bodies, while trying to extinguish the fire. The hospital in Deir al-Balah is the main medical facility operating in central Gaza, and thousands of people have taken shelter there after fleeing their homes in the war-ravaged territory. A separate strike flattened a house in northern Gaza, killing at least eight people, including three children, their parents and their grandmother, according to the ministry. An Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City on Saturday killed at least 16 people and wounded another 21, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which announced the toll on Sunday. Israel's military, which regularly accuses Palestinian militants of sheltering in civilian areas, said it struck a Hamas command center. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians, but the military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Gaza's Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants in its tallies. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 people hostage in their surprise attack into southern Israel last October. Israel's massive offensive launched in Gaza has killed at least 39,550 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were militants. Heavy airstrikes and ground operations have caused widespread destruction and displaced the vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hezbollah has regularly traded fire with Israel along the Lebanon border since the start of the war, in what the militant group says is aimed at relieving pressure on its fellow Iran-backed ally, Hamas. The continuous strikes and counterstrikes have grown in severity in recent months, raising fears of an even more destructive regional war. Over 590 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the occupied West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Most have been killed during Israeli raids and violent protests. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state.","aviv, tel, israeli, people, gaza, strikes, the, war, attack, ministry, palestinian, at, hospital, least, hamas, strike, israel, magen, adom, stabbing"

The landslides hit hilly villages in Kerala state's Wayanad district early Tuesday and destroyed many houses and a bridge, but authorities have yet to determine the full scope of the disaster. Rescuers were working to pull out people stuck under mud and debris, but their efforts were hampered due to blocked roads and unstable terrain. PM Manoj, press secretary to the Kerala chief minister, said the landslides had killed at least 49 people so far. Television visuals showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach to those who have been stranded. Vehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river. Authorities mobilized helicopters to help with rescue efforts and Indian army was roped in to build a temporary bridge after landslides destroyed a main bridge that linked the affected area. ""We are trying every way to rescue our people,"" state Health Minister Veena George said. In a post on social media platform X, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was ""distressed by the landslides in parts of Wayanad,"" a hilly district which is part of the Western Ghats mountain range. ""My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured,"" Modi wrote. He announced compensation of $2,388 to the victims' families. India's weather department has put Kerala on alert as the state has been lashed by incessant rains. Downpours have disrupted life for many, and authorities closed schools in some parts Tuesday. More rains are predicted through the day. Kerala is prone to heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Nearly 500 people were killed in the state in 2018 in one of the worst floods. The Indian Meteorological Department said the state has had heavy rainfall over its northern and central regions, with Wayanad district recording up to 28 centimeters (11 inches) of rain in the last 24 hours. ""Monsoon patterns are increasingly erratic and the quantum of rainfall that we receive in a short spell of time has increased. As a result, we see frequent instances of landslides and floods along the Western Ghats,"" said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. Koll also said authorities must check on rapid construction activities happening over landslide areas. ""Often landslides and flashfloods occur over regions where the impact of both climate change and direct human intervention in terms of land use changes are evident,"" he said. A 2013 report by a federal government-appointed committee said that 37% of the total area of the Western Ghats mountains should be declared as an ecosensitive area and proposed restrictions on any form of construction. The report's recommendations have not been implemented so far because state governments and residents opposed it. India regularly has severe floods during the monsoon season, which runs between June and September and brings most of South Asia's annual rainfall. The rains are crucial for rain-fed crops planted during the season, but often cause extensive damage. Scientists say monsoons are becoming more erratic because of climate change and global warming.","ghats, rains, landslides, the, indian, western, veena, wayanad, monsoon, kerala, centimeters, bridge, tropical, state, rescue, george, meteorology, narendra, climate, department"

The first landslide occurred at 2 a.m. on Tuesday, followed by another two hours later. Several areas, including Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala, were isolated, and roads were washed away causing immense damage to homes, said Kerala's top elected official, Pinarayi Vijayan. ""Efforts to locate missing persons continue with all available resources,"" their statement said. Mundakka is in an area highly prone to disasters. However, the gushing soil, gravel, and rock reached the town of Chooralmala, 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) away. Manoj said more than 8,300 people have been moved to 82 government-run relief camps.

The Indian Meteorological Department said Wayanad district had up to 28 centimeters (11 inches) of rain on Monday and Tuesday. Heavy rains also wreaked havoc in other parts of India this week. New Delhi, the Indian capital, shut schools on Thursday after torrential downpours the previous day submerged roads, left residents stranded and killed at least two people, news agency Press Trust of India reported. More rains were expected this week. In the mountainous state of Himachal Pradesh, popular with tourists, three people were killed and around 40 were reported missing after heavy rains and two cloudbursts washed away homes, flooded roads and damaged infrastructure, authorities told PTI on Thursday. Four people were also killed Wednesday in the neighboring Uttarakhand state following heavy rains. Meanwhile, at least 13 people, including three children, were killed in lightning strikes in eastern Bihar state on Thursday, a statement from the chief minister's office said. Most of the victims had gone to plant paddy in the fields when lightning struck them. India regularly has severe floods during the monsoon season, which runs between June and September and brings most of South Asia's annual rainfall. The rains are crucial for rainfed crops planted during the season, but often cause extensive damage. Scientists say monsoons are becoming more erratic because of climate change and global warming.","rains, people, the, wayanad, kerala, 194, more, at, least, state, than, estate, rescue, camps, tea, trust, chaliyar, cloudbursts, relief, areas"

Three others died in Pakistan. Widespread flooding has been reported in North Korea near the border with China with no word on whether anyone died. This time of year is monsoon and typhoon season in Asia, and climate change has intensified such storms. Heavy rains have triggered landslides and flooding, devastating crops, destroying homes and taking lives. Historical data shows that China is having more extremely hot days and more frequent intense rains, according to a report released last month by the China Meteorological Administration, which forecasts more of both in the coming 30 years. Governments have launched disaster prevention plans to try to mitigate the damage. Rescue teams scramble to evacuate people ahead of approaching storms and deliver relief goods by helicopter to cut-off areas. China has deployed drones for emergency communication in rain-prone provinces. Sometimes it isn't enough, as the tragic consequences playing out in Asia show. India: 194 dead, 187 missing Heavy rains sent torrents of mud and water through tea estates and villages in Kerala state in southern India early Tuesday, destroying bridges and flattening houses. Hope of finding survivors has waned as the search entered its fourth day. Bodies have been found as many as 30 kilometers (20 miles) downriver from the main landslides. The area is known for its picturesque tea and cardamom estates, with hundreds of plantation workers living in nearby temporary shelters. ""This was a very beautiful place,"" a shopkeeper said. ""I used to visit here many times. ... Now there is nothing left."" India regularly has severe floods during the monsoon season, which runs between June and September and brings rain that is crucial for crops. China: 48 dead, 35 missing Typhoon Gaemi was blamed for more than 30 deaths in the Philippines and 10 in Taiwan as it churned through the western Pacific last week, but it was still fatal after weakening to a tropical storm in China. Rain drenched parts of inland Hunan province for several days. On Sunday morning, a mudslide slammed into a homestay house in a popular weekend spot, killing 15 people. Elsewhere in Hunan, the bodies of three people were found on Monday, believed to be victims of another landslide. And authorities in nearby Zixing city announced Thursday that 30 people had died in floods, with 35 others missing. One other death in China was apparently tied to the storm, a delivery driver on a scooter struck by falling tree branches during high winds in Shanghai. China has recorded 25 major floods this year, the most since it began keeping statistics in 1998, the Ministry of Water Resources said this week. North Korea: Damage, but no information on deaths The tropical storm also generated heavy rain in northeast China on the border with North Korea, overflowing the Yalu River, which divides the two countries. In North Korea, the rain flooded 4,100 houses, 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) of farmland and many public buildings, roads and railways. Its state media did not give information on deaths, though the nation's leader Kim Jong Un implied there were casualties when he was quoted blaming public officials who had neglected disaster prevention, causing ""the casualty that cannot be allowed."" Military helicopters and navy and other government boats evacuated stranded residents. State TV aired footage showing Kim and other officials riding on rubber boats to examine the scale of the damage. The footage showed houses submerged in muddy waters with only their roofs visible. On the Chinese side, state television showed excavators in rushing water trying to clear debris after a mudslide in Jilin province. One city near North Korea asked people living below the third floor to move higher as the Yalu River rose. In Dandong, a large Chinese city along the river, rescuers evacuated residents in rubber dinghies on streets turned into virtual lakes. There were no reports of deaths. Pakistan: 3 dead Record rainfall in the city of Lahore flooded streets and left at least three people dead in Pakistan on Thursday. The deaths at the start of August came on top of 99 rain-related fatalities the previous month. Some parts of Lahore recorded 353 millimeters (14 inches) of rain in a few hours, breaking a 44-year-old record. The rain was so heavy that it entered some hospital wards in the capital of Punjab province. The victims included two children, one who drowned in a flooded street and another who fell from the roof of her house.","the, rain, typhoon, storm, hunan, gaemi, state, rains, province, jong, estates, boats, water, rubber, 30, kim, river, prevention, more, week"

Eight of the bodies have been identified and are being handed over the relatives. Six of them were Indian nationals. The two buses were on the key highway connecting Nepal's capital to southern parts of the country when they were swept away Friday morning near Simaltal, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of Kathmandu. The bodies were washed away down the Trishuli river as far as 100 kilometers (60 miles). The Chitwan District Administration Office published a list with names and details of the 65 people who were on board. There were 38 people on one bus and 27 in another. Three people survived after being ejected from one of the buses. Hundreds of rescuers from the police and army searched the river and downstream areas Tuesday but they have yet to find any trace of the two missing buses.

The buses, carrying more than 50 people, fell into the Trishuli river which was swollen by continuous rainfall over the past few days as heavy monsoon downpours turned their waters murky brown, making it even more difficult to see the wreckage. The body was that of a man and was found some 50 kilometers (31 miles) from where the buses fell, said government administrator Khima Nanda Bhusal. He added rescuers found a bank card and were in the process of identifying the man whose body was transported to a nearby hospital. Rescuers are now expanding their search area toward the southern region from the landslide area where the man's body was found, Bhusal said. Weather conditions improved Saturday and search teams were able to cover more ground in the hunt for the missing buses and passengers. Heavy equipment had cleared much of the landslides from the highway, making it easier to reach the area. Soldiers and police teams were using rubber rafts, divers and sensor equipment to try and locate the buses, which were pushed off the highway into the river by a landslide.

Three survivors apparently swam to safety, but rescuers by late morning had not found any trace of the buses, which likely were submerged and swept downstream in the Trishuli River. Nepal's rivers generally are fast-flowing due to the mountainous terrain. Heavy monsoon downpours in the past few days have swollen the waterways and turned their waters murky brown, making it even more difficult to see the wreckage. Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane told parliament 51 passengers were missing and more than 500 rescue personnel have been assigned to the search operation. Elsewhere in the country, 17 people have died and three more people were injured due to landslides in different districts in the past 24 hours, he said. The buses were on the key highway connecting the capital to southern parts of Nepal when they were swept away around 3 a.m. near Simaltal, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of Kathmandu. More landslides blocked routes to the area in several places, government administrator Khima Nanada Bhusal said. Additional rescuers and security forces were sent to help with the rescue efforts. Police and army personnel were searching using rubber rafts. Divers with scuba gear were also dispatched, according the Chitwan district police. The three survivors were being treated in the hospital, Bhusal said, adding that they reportedly jumped out of the bus and swam to the banks, where locals found them and took them to a nearby hospital.

The two buses, traveling through Simaltal in Bharatpur Metropolitan City-29, were swept away by the landslide into the Trishuli River around 3:30 AM today. According to authorities, one bus, operated by Ganapati Deluxe, was heading to Gaur in Rautahat from Kathmandu with around 41 passengers. The other bus, operated by Angel Deluxe, traveling to Kathmandu from Birgunj is said to have around 24 passengers on board. Rescue efforts are underway with over 75 personnel from all three security forces, but heavy rain and high water levels in the Trishuli River are hindering efforts, according to the authorities. A diving team from the Nepali Army and the Armed Police Force is searching for the buses, but they have yet to locate any of the vehicles. The authorities have cleared the debris at the incident area and temporarily opened one-way traffic. However, continuously falling stones and landslide debris are making it difficult for traffic to resume unobstructed. Although the Simaltal area was accessible, the Narayanghat-Mugling road section was blocked at the Kalikhola area, and authorities anticipated that it would take several hours to normalize traffic flow. The Muglin-Narayangadh road section was later reopened after clearing the debris at Kalikhola around 1 pm today. Currently, traffic is flowing in one direction only, with authorities actively working to facilitate two-way traffic as quickly as possible. Three passengers traveling on the Ganapati Deluxe bus reportedly managed to save themselves by jumping from the bus as it was being swept away. These survivors, from Dewahi Gonahi Municipality and Sisawa Dhamaura of Brindaban Municipality in Rautahat district, have been brought to Narayanghat for treatment. Authorities are still working to identify the vehicles and passengers involved, but exact details have not yet been confirmed. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' on Firday morning took to social media 'X' to express profound sadness over the disappearance of two buses swept away by a landslide in Simtal. He also lamented the loss of lives and property caused by floods and landslides throughout the country. Additionally, he instructed all government agencies, including the Home Administration, to undertake swift and effective measures to locate and rescue the passengers. Nepal has been grappling with monsoon-related disasters over the past few days, resulting in loss of lives, property damage, and widespread disruptions across the country. In Kaski district alone, 11 fatalities have been reported due to multiple landslide incidents that occurred last night. As many as 38 people have lost their lives due to monsoon-related disasters in Gandaki Province this year, contributing to a total of 103 fatalities nationwide from landslides and floods, as reported by police statistics collected. Additionally, 108 people have been injured, and six individuals remain missing. According to police reports, the fatalities include one in Kathmandu, 19 in Koshi, five in Madhesh Province, six in Bagmati, 38 in Gandaki, 23 in Lumbini, four in Karnali, and seven in Sudurpaschim Province.","buses, deluxe, ganapati, the, landslide, passengers, bus, mugling, fatalities, traffic, around, narayanghat, as, rautahat, province, debris, police, two, authorities, gonahi"

Paying homage to one of the biggest names in boxing history didn't do much for the fans that filled the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys on Friday night. Paul won an eight-round unanimous decision over Tyson as the hits didn't match the hype in a fight between the 27-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer and the former heavyweight champion in his first sanctioned pro bout in almost 20 years. All the hate from the pre-fight buildup was gone, replaced by boos from bewildered fans hoping for more action in a fight that drew plenty of questions about its legitimacy long before it happened. The fight wasn't close on the judge's cards, with one giving Paul an 80-72 edge and the other two calling it 79-73. ""Let's give it up for Mike,"" Paul said in the ring, not getting much response from a crowd that started filing out before the decision was announced. ""He's the greatest to ever do it. I look up to him. I'm inspired by him."" Tyson came after Paul immediately after the opening bell and landed a couple of quick punches but didn't try much else the rest of the way. Even fewer rounds than the normal 10 or 12 and two-minute rounds instead of three, along with heavier gloves designed to lessen the power of punches, couldn't do much to generate action. Paul was more aggressive after the quick burst from Tyson in the opening seconds, but the punching wasn't very efficient. There were quite a few wild swings and misses. ""I was trying to hurt him a little bit,"" said Paul, who improved to 11-1. ""I was scared he was going to hurt me. I was trying to hurt him. I did my best. I did my best."" Tyson mostly sat back and waited for Paul to come to him, with a few exceptions. It was quite the contrast to the co-main event, another slugfest between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano in which Taylor kept her undisputed super lightweight championship with another disputed decision. It was the first sanctioned fight since 2005 for Tyson, who fought Roy Jones in a much more entertaining exhibition in 2020. Paul started fighting a little more than four years ago. ""I didn't prove nothing to anybody, only to myself,"" Tyson said when asked what it meant to complete the fight. ""I'm not one of those guys that looks to please the world. I'm just happy with what I can do."" Tyson's record is now 50-7 with 44 knockouts. The fight was originally scheduled for July 20 but had to be postponed when Tyson was treated for a stomach ulcer after falling ill on a flight. Tyson slapped Paul on the face during the weigh-in a night before the fight, and they traded insults in several of the hype events, before and after the postponement. The hate was long gone by the end of the underwhelming fight. ""This guy's always had my back,"" Paul said about Tyson. ""I love him. I love his family, his coaches. It's just an honor to be in the ring with all of them."" The fight set a Texas record for combat sports with a gate of nearly $18 million, according to organizers, and Netflix had problems with the feed in the streaming platform's first live combat sports event. Netflix has more than 280 million subscribers globally. ""This is the biggest event,"" Paul said. ""Over 120 million people on Netflix. We crashed the site."" Mario Barrios retained the WBC welterweight title in a draw with Abel Ramos on the undercard. Barrios was in control early before Ramos dominated the middle rounds. Each recorded a knockdown in the 12-round bout. It was the first fight for the 29-year-old Barrios since he was appointed the WBC welterweight champ when Terence Crawford started the process of moving up from the 147-pound class. Barrios, who is 29-2-1, had won the interim WBC title with a unanimous decision over Yordenis Ugás last year. The 33-year-old Ramos is 28-6-3.","the, fight, wbc, tyson, old, year, welterweight, barrios, rounds, hype, pound, bout, decision, gloves, hate, bell, ramos, combat, mike, million"

Earlier, the England innings saw West Indies fast bowler Alzarri Joseph leave the field in a remarkable protest at field placements set by his captain Shai Hope. Carty reached his maiden century from 97 balls, eclipsing his previous best score in 27 ODIs of 88. He finished 128 not out while King fell just before the end for 102, having reached his third century from 113 deliveries. Before Wednesday, King had gone 13 innings without a half century and had not scored a century against a full ICC member nation. His earlier hundreds came against Oman and the United Arab Emirates. King and Carty's partnership was the second-highest for any wicket by the West Indies at home and guided them past England's 263-9 with 42 balls to spare. ""I've been getting a fair amount of starts and I just haven't been carrying on so I was just fortunate it came in such a crucial game and with the series still in doubt,"" King said. ""If you're putting in a lot of work off the field you have to believe it's just a matter of time, keep your processes and intensity and just believe in your ability."" Earlier, Phil Salt and Dan Mousley grafted half centuries which helped England overcome a poor start to reach a competitive total on a pitch which had offered variable bounce. After England lost the toss, Salt made 74 at the top of the order, sharing 70-run partnerships with Sam Curran (40) and Mousley who posted his maiden ODI half century before falling for 57. Jamie Overton made 32 from 21 balls and Jofra Archer an unbeaten 38 from 17 deliveries as England added 100 runs from the last 10 overs. Joseph and Hope engaged in a lengthy argument before the fourth over which was bowled by Joseph and had to be urged by the umpires to resume play. After a ball was played away on the off side during the over, Joseph remonstrated angrily with Hope and, when the over ended he walked from the field, returning after a short break. West Indies coach Daren Sammy had to move down to the boundary rope to attempt to calm the dispute between bowler and captain. England slumped to 24-4 at the end of the 10-over power play in the face of some hostile early bowling from West Indies, especially from Joseph who remained visibly angry. He dismissed Jordan Cox (1) with a brute of a ball which spat from just short of a length at 148 kph and which Cox couldn't avoid and gloved to Hope behind the stumps. Salt reached his fifth ODI half century from 79 balls and went on to 74 when he fell to Matthew Forde after a superb combined catch by Brandon King and Joseph. King reached Salt's towering shot into the deep, took the ball in both hands and flicked it back to Joseph as he balanced before running over the boundary. Salt's dismissal ended his 70-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Mousley who reached his half century from 64 balls.","century, odi, carty, salt, indies, balls, the, his, sammy, daren, half, alzarri, west, joseph, partnership, wicket, maiden, boundary, deliveries, mousley"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/captain-liam-livingstone-rises-to-the-occasion-as-england-levels-odi-series-against-west-indies,Captain Liam Livingstone rises to the occasion as England levels ODI series against West Indies,Associated Press,2024-11-03 22:04:42,"NORTH SOUND, NOVEMBER 3 Captain Liam Livingstone's first ODI century in a 140-run partnership with Sam Curran inspired England to a five-wicket win over West Indies on Saturday to level the three-match series. England finished its successful run chase on 329-5 in the second one-day international with 15 balls remaining. The form hinted at when Livingstone top-scored with 48 in England's eight-wicket loss in the first match on Thursday emerged in full bloom as he reached his century from 77 balls and finished 124 not out from 85 deliveries. Livingstone had a reputation of being one of England cricket's great untapped talents as he produced only four half centuries in 31 previous ODIs. But his accession to the ODI captaincy has been energizing and he showed the full range of his ability as he led England to the second-highest successful ODI chase in the West Indies. England had been set a formidable target after Livingstone's counterpart, West Indies captain Shai Hope, made 117 to lead his team to 328-6. Phil Salt's 59 and a maiden half century by Jacob Bethell gave England a solid beginning. Livingstone began watchfully but steadily imparted momentum to the England innings as he eclipsed his previous ODI best of 95. He was in full flow when he took 26 runs from the 45th over, bowled by Jayden Seales, and 24 from Shamar Joseph in the 46th before finishing the chase with plenty to spare. The match was still in the balance when England was 176-4 in the 30th over with the Livingstone-Curran partnership in its infancy and 7.5 runs per over needed to win. But Livingstone expertly controlled his team's chase with the able assistance of Curran who was out for a run-a-ball 52 in the 46th over with the target in sight at 300-5. ""Certain things I've done in practice, the end I had to the summer in England ... I felt I was getting back to my best,"" Livingstone said. ""I'm just maturing a little bit, knowing my game pretty well and just enjoying cricket which I know is the main thing. ""A pretty proud day today."" The third and deciding match of the series will be played at Bridgetown, Barbados, on Wednesday. Young fast bowler John Turner had West Indies in trouble at 12-2, dismissing Brandon King (7) and Evin Lewis (4), inside four overs after Livingstone won the toss. Dismissing Lewis was a welcome wicket for England as he made an unbeaten 94 on Thursday to lead the West Indies to victory in the series opener. Hope came to the crease in the fourth over with the immediate job of rebuilding the West Indies innings in the company of Keacy Carty (71). He left in the 47th over when West Indies were 297-6 and in the middle of a late charge which brought 93 runs from the last 10 overs. Hope and Keacy put on 143 for the third wicket, carefully at first but with increasing authority. Keacy gave a chance at eight to Bethell at backward point, struggled for boundaries early, then marched to his first half century in five ODI innings from 62 balls. Hope raised his half century - his 42nd in one-day internationals - from 66 balls with a six off a short ball from Bethell. Keacy was out in the 31st over when West Indies were 155-3. Hope was joined by Sherfane Rutherford (54) with whom he added 79 for the fourth wicket, carrying the West Indies to 234-4 just as the last 10 overs were about to begin. Rutherford continued his superb form of West Indies' recent one-day series in Sri Lanka in which he scored three consecutive half centuries with a top-score of 80. He took his first four from the second ball he faced and added three more and three sixes in reaching 50 from 35 balls. After Rutherford, Shimron Hetmeyer scored a sprightly 24 from 11 balls with three sixes as the West Indies rapidly closed on 300. Hope, struggling with cramp in warm conditions, was out just before that milestone was achieved. But Roston Chase made 20 not out from 22 balls and Matthew Forde hit three consecutive sixes in his 11-ball 23 to keep up the momentum. England used nine bowlers but was hampered by dropped catches. Jofra Archer's use of the short ball wasn't always effective but he was England's best with 1-40 from nine overs.","livingstone, indies, the, odi, chase, balls, century, west, curran, his, liam, half, wicket, shai, turner, captain, series, three, archer, jofra"

Sri Lanka scored 179-7 in their 20 overs after West Indies captain Rovman Powell won the toss and chose to field at Rangiri Dambulla Stadium. In reply, West Indies reached 180-5 with five deliveries remaining to take an early lead in the series. King smashed a six and eleven fours in his innings of 63 runs off 33 deliveries while Lewis hit four sixes and five fours for his 28-ball 50. The pair at times maintained a run rate of more than 13 runs per over to lay a solid platform. After Lewis was out in the 10th over - caught by Chamindu Wickramasinghe off fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana - the hosts took two more wickets for 21 runs to threaten a comeback. But West Indies' middle order maintained the momentum to take their team over the line. Pathirana took two wickets for Sri Lanka. Earlier, captain Charith Asalanka (59) and Kamindu Mendis (51) led Sri Lanka's batting in posting a competitive total. Asalanka faced 35 deliveries and hit nine fours, and Mendis hit two sixes and five fours in his 40-ball knock. Fast bowler Romario Shepherd took 2-39 for the West Indies.

This victory, Sri Lanka's most dominant over the Kiwis, also marks their first win against New Zealand in 15 years. The hero of the games, left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya, was named Player of the Series after a masterful performance, claiming 18 wickets across the two matches. Meanwhile, Kamindu Mendis took home Man of the Match honours for his unbeaten 182, anchoring Sri Lanka's colossal total of 602-5 declared. With this knock, Mendis etched his name in history, joining the great Sir Don Bradman as the third joint-fastest player to reach 1,000 test runs. Jayasuriya, who took nine wickets in the first test, was at his best again, snaring another nine wickets in the second test as New Zealand's batters struggled to cope with Sri Lanka's spin-heavy attack. Debutant Nishan Peiris was the perfect foil, chipping in with nine wickets of his own, including a five-wicket haul in the second innings. ""We discussed the need to score big in the first innings. That has been something that has been worrying us for a while. Glad we rectified that this innings,"" said Sri Lanka captain Dananjaya de Silva. ""The spinners were superb. They kept creating pressure and didn't allow New Zealand to get away with things. It was a superb display. That's how we want to compete in home conditions, dominate the opposition from ball one,"" he added. New Zealand's woes began early, bundled out for a paltry 88 in their first innings. Forced to follow on, the Kiwis showed more fight in their second innings, posting 360 – their highest total of the tour and in Galle – but it was too little, too late. Tom Blundell, Glenn Phillips and Mitchell Santner all contributed half-centuries in the second innings, but the tourists needed far more to challenge Sri Lanka's dominance. Resuming at 199-5, New Zealand lost three wickets before lunch on the fourth day. Despite Sri Lanka's fielding lapses, which saw three catches dropped, they eventually cleaned up after lunch. Jayasuriya removed Ajaz Patel and Peiris took the final scalp of Santner, stumped by Kusal Mendis, sealing the series win for Sri Lanka. ""We had our moments in the series, but disappointed with the end result,"" said New Zealand captain Tim Southee. ""That morning session on day three when we lost nine wickets was very disappointing. ""There were dropped catches and missed stumpings as well in the Sri Lankan innings and in these conditions when you don't hold onto those chances it is very difficult."" With this victory, Sri Lanka has now won three consecutive test matches and bolstered their hopes of qualifying for the ICC World Test Championship final at Lord's next June.","sri, lanka, test, series, innings, zealand, the, bradman, dananjaya, don, wickets, lankan, prabath, southee, jayasuriya, match, player, mendis, tim, silva"

Chasing 95 for victory, India finished on 98-3 in 17.2 overs to win the match on Day 5 by seven wickets. Yashasvi Jaiswal (51) and Virat Kohli (29 not out) put on 58 off 67 balls for the third wicket of the second innings. India lost Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill cheaply, but had no major issues chasing down the target before tea. Paceman Jasprit Bumrah and spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin had each taken three wickets to help bundle Bangladesh out for 146 earlier Tuesday in the second innings, leaving India two sessions to get the runs required to complete a series sweep. Ashwin was named player of the series for 11 wickets in two tests, and a match-winning hundred in Chennai. He tied Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan for most player of the series awards in test cricket – 11. India won the first test by 280 runs. A three-match Twenty20 series between India and Bangladesh will start Sunday. ""Once we lost 2 1/2 days, we wanted to get them out quickly on Day 4 and see what we could do with the bat ... it was about how many overs we needed in the second innings, which meant we had to try and up the run rate, scoring as many (runs) as possible quickly,"" India captain Rohit Sharma said. ""This pitch didn't have a lot for the bowlers. To make a game of it then was a superb effort from the bowlers. And the batters of course, they bought into the mindset of attacking and getting runs as quickly as possible."" India set up a series sweep when it scored runs quickly and declared at 285-9 late on Day 4 - blitzing Bangladesh's bowling from the start and recording the fastest 50 in tests off only 18 deliveries - to take a first-innings lead of 52. Mehidy Hasan Miraz took 2-44 and dismissed both Sharma (8) and Gill (6) in India's otherwise comfortable run chase. He also had a leg-before-wicket decision against Kohli turned down on review. Player of the match Jaiswal hit eight fours and a six in his second half-century of the test after 72 in the first innings. He was caught off Taijul Islam on the cusp of victory. Rishabh Pant scored the winning runs. Kohli's 37-ball knock included four boundaries. Momentum had gone in India's favor on the fifth morning of the match. Jadeja took 3-34 as Bangladesh lost four wickets for three runs and eventually lost its last seven wickets for 110. Ashwin returned 3-50, and Bumrah snared 3-17 in 10 overs. Most of the first day and all of the second and third days of the test were washed out, leaving little prospect for a result in Kanpur unless something dramatic happened. And so play had resumed on Day 4 with India making a charge for victory in search of valuable World Test Championship points – 437 runs were scored for 18 wickets in 85 overs. Resuming Day 5 on 26-2, Bangladesh lost first-inning century maker Mominul Haque (2) when he was caught off Ashwin's bowling with the addition of 10 to the total. Opener Shadman Islam added 55 with skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto for the fourth wicket. In doing so, Islam scored 50 off 101 balls, becoming the first Bangladesh opener to score a test half-century on Indian soil. But he couldn't regain concentration and was out soon after, with Jaiswal taking a fine catch at gully off pace bowler Akash Deep. Just six balls earlier, Jadeja bowled Shanto for 19 runs and the batting collapse was underway. Litton Das was caught behind off Jadeja, and Shakib al Hasan returned a simple catch for a two-ball duck in what could be his last test innings. Jadeja picked three wickets in three overs as Bangladesh slumped to 94-7. Bumrah then had Miraz (9) caught behind and trapped Islam lbw for a duck. Veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim hung in for a determined 37 off 63 balls as India desperately searched for the last wicket in an extended three-hour session. Rahim threw it away on the final ball pre-lunch, going for a wild swipe off Bumrah and was bowled.","test, runs, the, wickets, series, overs, century, mominul, haque, innings, first, kanpur, three, rahim, mushfiqur, akash, najmul, turnaround, islam, shanto"

Ashwin took 6-88 as Bangladesh was bowled out for 234 runs in its second innings chasing an improbable 515 for victory. Ravindra Jadeja picked up 3-58 as the spin duo consigned the Tigers to an early defeat on the morning of the fourth day. India take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series, with the second match to begin on Friday in Kanpur. Ashwin, who also scored his sixth test hundred in the first innings, was named player of the match in his hometown test. ""I have watched a lot of international cricket at this venue (as a kid), so it's a special feeling every time I play here,"" 38-year-old Ashwin said. ""I am enjoying my game right now. ""The first innings was an opportunity to dig deep and Jadeja helped get through the tough phases of that innings. It was a special knock and didn't sink in until day two. I am glad I ended up with a few wickets today as well."" Starting from overnight 158-4, Bangladesh put up strong resistance in the first hour of play. Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto and veteran all-rounder Shakib al Hasan put on 36 runs as India went wicketless in the first hour. Shakib survived a stumping chance off Jadeja, as Rishabh Pant couldn't grasp the ball cleanly, but otherwise the Bangladesh pair applied themselves to deny India early inroads into the lower order. Things changed around quickly in the second hour. Four balls after the drinks' break, Ashwin had Shakib caught at short leg to provide the breakthrough. Shakib scored 25 off 56 balls, including three fours. Jadeja then had Litton Das caught at slip for one, and Ashwin completed his five-for with Mehidy Hasan Miraz holing out to long on for eight. Shanto went for a big swipe off Jadeja as he ran out of patience, falling for 82 runs. He faced 127 balls, and hit eight fours as well as three sixes to top score for the tourists. Ashwin got his sixth as Taskin Ahmed (5) quickly followed his captain, while Jadeja rounded off the lopsided victory in the 63rd over, bowling Hasan Mahmud (7). Bangladesh lost its last six wickets for 40 runs across 45 deliveries, crashing to a big defeat 10 minutes short of lunch on this fourth day. The visitors had won the toss and opted to bowl, reducing India to 144-6 on day one. Ashwin led India's recovery with 113 runs as Jadeja (86) helped add 199 runs for the seventh wicket to lift India to 376 runs in its first innings. Bumrah's 4-50 helped bowl out Bangladesh for just 149 in reply. Centuries from Rishabh Pant (109) and Shubman Gill (119 not out) helped India post 287-4 declared in its second innings.

New Zealand resumed play on the final day needing 68 more runs to reach a victory target of 275 but only added four runs before Sri Lanka wrapped up the game in 3.4 overs on Monday. Overnight batsman Rachin Ravindra, who had kept New Zealand's hopes alive with a valiant 91 on Sunday, could only add one run to his total before being trapped leg before wicket by Jayasuriya. The promising left-hander's resistance ended as he misjudged a delivery trying to defend on the back foot. In Jayasuriya's next over, he bowled last man William O'Rourke for a duck, sealing Sri Lanka's victory in a tightly contested match and the 32-year-old spinner's eighth five-wicket haul in tests. ""I love playing here in Galle,"" said man of the match Jayasuriya, who now has 88 wickets in 15 matches for Sri Lanka . ""There is so much assistance for spin on this wicket, all what you need is to do is to just keep pitching the ball in the right areas and the wicket will do the rest."" ""If you keep doing that wickets will come."" Although Ravindra narrowly missed out on a well-deserved century, his score of 92 is now the highest by a New Zealand batter in Galle, surpassing Ross Taylor's 86. Notably, no Black Cap has scored a century in Galle, where they have now lost all five matches played. Sri Lanka's win moved them up to third place in the World Test Championship standings, behind India and Australia. Meanwhile, New Zealand dropped to fourth after starting the series in third position. Playing their first test since March, several Black Cap players put in strong performances, especially pacer O'Rourke who took eight wickets in his first test in Asia and just his third match overall. ""He has really impressed in his brief career, New Zealand captain Tim Southee said of O'Rourke. ""The great thing is to come to a place like Galle and put up that performance. He has never played in conditions like these before and he is a good prospect for us moving forward."" On the back of O'Rourke's 5-55 the Kiwis managed to secure a first-innings lead, a significant thing on a Galle pitch that becomes increasingly difficult to bat on as the game progresses. But New Zealand's failure to break the crucial 147-run third-wicket partnership between Dinesh Chandimal and Dimuth Karunaratne in Sri Lanka's second innings proved decisive. Both experienced batters scored half-centuries, with Angelo Mathews also contributing a vital 50, helping Sri Lanka set a challenging target of 275. On a deteriorating pitch, that total proved too much for the visitors. The teams will remain in Galle for the second test, which begins on Thursday. Sri Lanka will be hoping to win its first test series against New Zealand since 2009. Since then, the sides have met in six series with New Zealand winning four and two ending in draws.","test, zealand, galle, lanka, sri, cap, jayasuriya, wicket, the, wickets, black, new, southee, prabath, rachin, innings, third, ravindra, tim, first"

The tourists ended the day at 207-8, still 68 runs short of their 275-run target but with the pitch offering significant assistance to the spinners, Sri Lanka looks set to wrap up the game. Top-order batsman Rachin Ravindra has been fighting a lone battle for New Zealand. The left-hander remained unbeaten on 91 at stumps and could become the first New Zealander to score a hundred in Galle. Ravindra batted with a clear game plan, combining solid defense with an effective use of both the conventional and reverse sweeps to find scoring opportunities. He also capitalized on a rare loose delivery from part-time spinner Dhananjaya de Silva, dispatching the full toss for six. Chasing 275 was never going to be easy for New Zealand, and Prabath Jayasuriya made life difficult for the batsmen. He claimed the crucial wicket of Kane Williamson, enticing the experienced player out of his crease before getting the ball to spin away slightly, allowing Kusal Mendis to complete a sharp stumping. Ravindra found support in wicketkeeper Tom Blundell, and the pair added 56 runs for the fifth wicket. However, Jayasuriya struck again, producing a beauty to bowl Blundell around his legs. Soon after, he dismissed Glenn Phillips, who posed a threat with his aggressive hitting, caught at second slip. Play on Saturday was halted due to Sri Lanka's presidential election, but on Sunday, Sri Lanka resumed their innings at 237-4. Angelo Mathews went on to register a half-century, taking the home team's lead past 250. The day's bowling honors belonged to New Zealand left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel, who finished with 6-90 runs. He was well-supported by fast bowler William O'Rourke, who took three wickets, adding to his five-wicket haul from the first innings to finish with eight in the match. Sri Lanka will be eager to pick up the final two wickets quickly on the fifth morning, but New Zealand will hold onto hopes of a slim chance with Ravindra still at the crease.","the, ajaz, galle, blundell, zealand, rourke, crease, rachin, dhananjaya, william, lanka, sri, patel, tom, test, ravindra, wicket, silva, sweeps, spinner"

Karunaratne made 83 and Chandimal 61 as Sri Lanka reached stumps on 237-4 in its second innings. They combined from the third over after Pathum Nissanka was dismissed, and navigated challenging moments on a pitch that is increasingly difficult to bat on, with the ball spinning and bouncing as it typically does in Galle. ""When the ball is turning in Galle, defense is a dangerous option. You should always look at scoring runs,"" Karunaratne said. ""It was a good partnership with Chandimal. We have played lot of cricket together and we understand each other's game."" While New Zealand's spinners were handled quite comfortably, pacer William O'Rourke was again its most effective bowler. After taking a five-for in the first innings, he grabbed three more wickets with his extra bounce on Friday. Karunaratne was cleaned up by leftie Ajaz Patel after his 39th fifty. Chandimal, following his third fifty this month, went in the next over, caught at leg slip off O'Rourke. O'Rourke then got first-innings centurion Kamindu Mendis to edge to slip on 13. New Zealand bowled to attacking fields but shifted to a more defensive approach when the lead exceeded 150, keen to protect boundaries. Captain Dhananjaya de Silva and Angelo Mathews, with 34 each, were involved in an unfinished 59-run stand for the fifth wicket. Mathews survived a big appeal in the day's last over. After he was hit on the back leg by Glenn Phillips, umpire Michael Gough gave not out. Replays showed the ball would have hit leg stump but it was umpire's call. New Zealand was batting at the start of Friday, resumed on 255-4 and was all out for 340 for a lead of 35. Daryl Mitchell posted a half-century beside Tom Latham and Kane Williamson and batted well for his 57, but his run out shifted the momentum. Phillips smashed an unbeaten 49 off 48 balls with two fours and five sixes, and missed out on a fifty when Ramesh Mendis cleaned up last man O'Rourke. ""We had the momentum in the morning and then that run out gave Sri Lanka a chance to get back into the game,"" Phillips said. ""I thought there was a run. My partner trusted my call. I take responsibility and hopefully my options will be better next time."" Prabath Jayasuriya was the standout bowler, finishing with four wickets, while Ramesh Mendis and De Silva shared five wickets. Saturday will be a rest day as Sri Lanka goes to the polls to elect a president. The test match will resume on Sunday. ""We have a lead of 200. Ideally we would like 350, but we will settle for 300 in any case,"" Karunaratne said. ""It's not easy to score that many runs in the fourth innings in Galle.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/sri-lanka-change-batting-lineup-for-new-zealand-tests-after-england-tour,Sri Lanka change batting lineup for New Zealand tests after England tour,Associated Press,2024-09-17 22:20:23,"GALLE, SEPTEMBER 17 Sri Lanka has rewarded Kamindu Mendis for his profitable tour of England by moving him up the batting order for the two-test series against New Zealand starting on Wednesday in Galle. Mendis reaped a century and two half-centuries from his fourth, fifth and sixth career tests over the past month in England, where he was Sri Lanka's player of the series lost 2-1. In his brief test career, he has three hundreds and four fifties. It was time to move him from No. 7 to No. 5 in the lineup, Sri Lanka coach Sanath Jayasuriya said on Tuesday. ""There was lot of discussion that Kamindu has to move up the order when we were in England. Too often he was batting with the tail and we felt that we need to make the best use of him,"" Jayasuriya said. Former captain Dinesh Chandimal, who occupied the No. 5 slot, has been moved to No. 3 and stripped of wicketkeeping duty. Kusal Mendis, no relation to Kamindu, will keep wickets and bat at No. 7. Sri Lanka is expected to make two more changes from the side that beat England in the third test last week at the Oval. Seam bowlers Vishwa Fernando and Milan Ratnayake are expected to make way for spinners Prabath Jayasuriya and Ramesh Mendis. ""Our fast bowlers have done well, but it's horses for courses and we have to back spin in Galle,"" Jayasuriya said. Spin-friendly Galle favors the home team, but New Zealand has done well in these contests. Sri Lanka last won a series against the Black Caps in 2009. The last two series in Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2019 ended 1-1. New Zealand has retired Sri Lanka great Rangana Herath on its staff to help its spinners, but the weather might be a bigger influence. The forecast across the test is not good. The visitors will be used to that. Rain and a soggy outfield washed out all five days of New Zealand's scheduled one-off test against Afghanistan last week in Greater Noida, India. That was also to be New Zealand's warmup for this series. ""Disappointing, no doubt, but we cannot control the weather,"" New Zealand captain Tim Southee said. ""It would have been nice to have a test match against an ever improving side. However, we have had some good training and have spent time together both in India and in Galle."" While New Zealand hasn't played a test since March, it won't be cold for long. ""Eight test matches between now and December is lot of cricket. We are excited,"" Southee said. ""We are ranked three in the World Test Championship and it's an opportunity for us to get some points and move forward."" He has another personal milestone in sight, too. Southee needs 20 more wickets to become the second New Zealander to take 400 in tests after Richard Hadlee's 431. ""I have played for a long time and when you do that you come closer to these milestones,"" said Southee, who has 100 caps. ""We have a lot of tours ahead. Especially in this part of the world. Every game you are going out to do your role and take wickets for the side. It will be nice if I can achieve those milestones. But the focus is on winning games."" Lineups: Sri Lanka squad: Dhananjaya de Silva (captain), Dimuth Karunaratne, Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Kamindu Mendis, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Oshada Fernando, Asitha Fernando, Vishwa Fernando, Lahiru Kumara, Prabath Jayasuriya, Ramesh Mendis, Jeffrey Vandersay, Milan Rathnayake.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/sri-lanka-beats-england-by-8-wickets-for-only-its-fourth-test-victory-on-english-soil,Sri Lanka beats England by 8 wickets for only its fourth test victory on English soil,Associated Press,2024-09-09 21:17:38,"LONDON, SEPTEMBER 9 Sri Lanka earned only its fourth test victory on English soil after an unbeaten century by opener Pathum Nissanka helped secure an eight-wicket win in the third and final match of the series against England at The Oval on Monday. England won the series 2-1 but missed out on a second clean sweep of its international summer, having defeated the West Indies 3-0 in July. Starting Day 4 on 94-1 and requiring 125 more runs to win, the Sri Lankans needed barely two hours to complete the job in clinical fashion. The platform was built on Sunday when they skittled England for 156 in just 34 overs and were given a victory target of 219. Nissanka underpinned the chase with his second test hundred, reaching three figures in 107 balls and finishing 127 not out as Sri Lanka got to 219 in 40.3 overs. The diminutive opener, who struck 13 fours and two sixes, spread his arms wide and soaked in the applause inside a half-full ground after passing 100, then kissed his bat and looked to the sky. His other century was against the West Indies in 2021, his first year in the Sri Lankan test team. The quality of his knock raised the question why he didn't start the first test against England at Old Trafford last month, before he was recalled for the second test at Lord's. Fittingly, it was Nissanka who scored the clinching runs with a cut for four. The tourists' previous test wins in England came in 1998 – that famous 10-wicket victory in a one-off test at The Oval – as well as at Trent Bridge in 2006 and Headingley in 2014. This latest one looked unlikely after they won the toss but couldn't capitalize on perfect bowling conditions on Day 1, which England ended on 221-3. It was all Sri Lanka after that, however, as England got sloppy and occasionally reckless. The only wicket to fall on Monday was that of Kusal Mendis (39), who pulled a delivery from Gus Atkinson and saw Shoaib Bashir take a diving catch in the deep. Angelo Mathews was unbeaten on 32 alongside Nissanka at the end, with the pair putting on 111 runs in an unbroken stand for the third wicket.","sri, test, the, wicket, lankans, pathum, nissanka, lanka, soil, runs, victory, clinching, applause, opener, lankan, english, overs, diving, cut, 107"

Sri Lanka, which is 2-0 down and has already lost the series, failed to take advantage of winning the toss and opting bowl first under thick cloud cover at The Oval. England had only lost the wicket of Dan Lawrence (5) before the umpires deemed the light too poor and took the players off barely an hour into the morning session. An early lunch was taken but then rain arrived on what was a dank and gloomy day in south London. By mid-afternoon, the players were still off the field and only 15 overs had been bowled. Duckett was onto 51 for his 10th half-century in 26 tests. He brought his fifty up in 48 balls and has hit seven fours already, the best being a back-foot drive through the covers. The left-handed Duckett was in the middle with stand-in captain Ollie Pope (14 not out) when play was stopped for bad light despite the floodlights being on at The Oval. Lawrence, a makeshift opener while Zak Crawley is out injured, only made 9 and 7 at Lord's in the second test and didn't fare any better a week later across London. It took him 11 balls to get off the mark and then he tried to flick a short-of-length delivery from Lahiru Kumara into the leg side, only to misjudge it and top-edge to Pathum Nissanka coming in from gully. Sri Lanka went with an all-seam attack that looked ideal for the early conditions. Spinner Prabath Jayasuriya was left out and Vishwa Fernando recalled, while No. 3 batter Kusal Mendis also returned to the team. England gave a debut to 20-year-old left-arm seamer Josh Hull, who has been fast-tracked into the squad despite only taking 16 first-class wickets in 10 matches in his career. England coach Brendon McCullum has acknowledged it is a ""hunch"" and a ""punt"" to bring Hull into the team and is thinking ahead to wanting a left-armer in the attack for future series, including the Ashes next year. Hull was given his first test cap by former England captain Andrew Flintoff and was seen having his photograph taken with his family on the field before play began. England, which beat the West Indies 3-0 in their series in July, has already defeated Sri Lanka at Old Trafford and Lord's, and is looking to complete a clean sweep of home test series in a summer for the first time since 2004.","the, flintoff, mccullum, brendon, hull, test, series, jayasuriya, prabath, andrew, london, duckett, josh, ollie, century, pope, hunch, photograph, floodlights, stops"

However, the Sri Lankans took two big wickets - Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope, the big scorers from the first innings - to leave England on 35-2 at lunch and the match very much in the balance. England leads by 97, with Dan Lawrence - under pressure for runs - on a cavaliar 20 not out. The English have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series. Sri Lanka resumed on 211-5 but was dismissed for 263, with 20-year-old left-armer Hull removing captain Dhananjaya de Silva (69) and Vishwa Fernando (0) to finish with figures of 3-53 in his first test match. Kamindu Mendis, the overnight batter with De Silva, was out for 64 when he edged Chris Woakes to Joe Root at first slip and Olly Stone dismissed Milan Rathnayake (7) to post figures of 3-35. England went on the attack at the start of the second innings, but it has let the Sri Lankans back in the match. Duckett tried to slog Asitha Fernando down the ground but mishit it to Vishwa Fernando at mid-on for 7. Pope, the century-maker in the first innings, then played Lahiru Kumara onto his own stumps to also depart for 7. Lawrence was still there but he was going for pretty much everything, even coming down the pitch and trying to hit pacer Rathnayake into the stands - and missing. Lawrence, a makeshift opener while Zak Crawley is out injured, made only 9 and 7 at Lord's in the second test and 5 in the first innings.","hull, sri, the, silva, rathnayake, lankans, dhananjaya, fernando, lanka, innings, josh, test, lead, pope, olly, de, armer, asitha, kumara, vishwa"

Sri Lanka was 93-5 in reply to England's 325 when De Silva and Mendis combined for 118 to the end of a day shortened by bad light. De Silva, 64 not out, and Mendis, 54 not out, repaired Sri Lanka to 211-5, trailing England by 114 runs. Bad light meant England could utilise only spin after tea, and there was only one concrete chance to part the Sri Lankan duo and debutant Josh Hull shelled it. Shoaib Bashir drew a mis-hit from De Silva and the ball sailed straight to the newcomer, who made a mess of a regulation chance as it squirmed to the floor. Hull looked aghast as his error was replayed on the big screen, and he would have felt every one of the 59 runs that came before play was called off for the day. England went wicketless in the evening gloom, with 17 overs of spin split between Bashir, Dan Lawrence and Joe Root, and will relish the chance to unleash Hull and his fellow seamers under brighter skies on Sunday. England batted carelessly in a chaotic morning session to turn their overnight position of 221-3 into an underwhelming 325 all out. England managed just 104 more runs as Milan Rathnayake, Vishwa Fernando and De Silva each picked up two wickets. Hull has fast-tracked from division two of the County Championship after just 10 first-class appearances, and been promoted due to his imposing two-meter frame and left-arm angle, and found himself in the thick of the action on day two. Coming in at No. 10 he was part of England's batting collapse in the morning session, as the last six wickets were lost for just 35 runs. But Hull's real challenge came when stand-in skipper Ollie Pope, who had earlier added 51 runs to his overnight century for 154, threw him the ball for the first time. Midway through his third over, Hull had a moment he will never forget as Sri Lanka opener Pathum Nissanka was brilliantly caught at short cover by a diving Chris Woakes. After a solitary over from Woakes before lunch, the real work began after the interval as Sri Lanka's openers put on 34 in a steady start. It took only one lapse to undo their work, a poor call inviting Stone to throw down the stumps and send Dimuth Karunaratne on his way for 9. Woakes was bizarrely instructed to bowl off-spin for the next four balls, the umpires deciding that the light was too dim to bowl pace before reversing their decision at the end of the over. Woakes, whose tweakers left a lot to be desired, was happy to get back to his long run and soon had Kusal Mendis fending to slip on 14. Stone made further inroads, finding Angelo Mathews' edge outside off stump then pinning Dinesh Chandimal on the back leg but the biggest cheer was reserved for Hull. His breakthrough wicket needed a healthy assist from Woakes, who swooped to catch the lively Nissanka after a 51-ball 64, but bowled some neat deliveries in his first five overs as an international. England has already won the series after four-day wins at Old Trafford and Lord's.","sri, the, lanka, hull, nissanka, runs, oval, day, silva, spin, fightback, lankan, his, meter, pathum, mathews, dhananjaya, light, angelo, chance"

Chasing a world-record 483 for victory at the home of cricket, the Sri Lankans reached lunch at 136-4 and still needing 347 more runs. Resuming on 53-2, the tourists lost nightwatchman Prabath Jayasuriya (4) - who edged Chris Woakes to second slip - before a 55-run partnership between opener Karunaratne and Angelo Mathews provided some resistance to England. Karunaratne reached a half-century for the 54th time in tests before he tried to fend off a rising delivery from fast bowler Olly Wood and flicked it off his glove behind to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith for 55.

The team, which recently returned from a two-week training camp at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore, India, left for Sri Lanka to continue their preparations. According to the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), the Nepali team is scheduled to play a series of practice matches against Sri Lanka's Development Team over three days. The practice matches are set for September 3, 5, and 7. The Nepali squad includes Captain Rohit Kumar Poudel, Deependra Singh Airee, Sandeep Lamichhane, Aasif Sheikh, Anil Shah, Dev Khanal, Bhim Sarki, and Aarif Sheikh, as stated by CAN.

The Sri Lankans still trailed England by 15 runs and might only have five wickets left, with Dinesh Chandimal taken to the hospital after being forced to retire hurt following a blow to his right thumb off a quick delivery by Mark Wood. England took a 122-run lead after the first innings thanks to a maiden test century by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, whose 111 helped the hosts post 358 all out after resuming Day 3 on 259-6. Sri Lanka slumped to 6-3 in its first innings and didn't start its second innings any better after being 2-1 following the departures of Nishan Madushka and Kusal Mendis for ducks before lunch. Dimuth Karunaratne was the first to go in the second session when he was outdone by the pace of Wood - off his very first ball - and nicked an inside edge onto his body and up to Harry Brook at second slip for 27. Chandimal looked in pain after his thumb was snapped back by Wood's sharp delivery and, after some treatment, went to the hospital for an X-ray. He could yet miss the rest of the series in what would be another blow to the Sri Lankans. Angelo Mathews (48 not out) continued to hold off England's seam attack but he was losing partners, with captain Dhananjaya de Silva trapped lbw for 10. Sri Lanka reviewed, but to no success. Kamindu Mendis was 6 not out and in the middle with Mathews. Smith was enjoying a fine day, taking a catch to remove Kusal Mendis after a century containing eight fours and one six as he guided the tail through to a big total, considering England was 67-3 at one point on Thursday. The 24-year-old Smith was chosen ahead of Ben Foakes and Jonny Bairstow to be England's wicketkeeper for this international summer and hasn't let his country down, impressing behind the stumps and with the bat. He struck knocks of 70 and 95 in England's 3-0 test series win over the West Indies last month and now has a century in his fourth test match.","lankans, test, sri, innings, smith, thumb, the, dhananjaya, blow, wood, jamie, mendis, england, wicketkeeper, silva, madushka, foakes, departures, second, his"

Set 205 to win, England was faltering at 70-3 but Root and Harry Brook (32) steadied the innings before the former captain guided the team home to its target as shadows lengthened on a sun-baked evening at Old Trafford. The English finished on 205-5 to secure a fourth straight test victory this summer, after beating the West Indies 3-0 in July. The win in Manchester was also significant in that it might have signaled a reset of ""Bazball"" - the nickname of the expansive approach favored by the leadership team of captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum. Root and his teammates picked their moments to attack as the run-rate fell to around 3.5 per over by the end of the second innings. Root, who only hit two fours - the second coming off what proved to be the last ball of the match - said ""sometimes it's good to win ugly."" ""It was a tricky one today,"" Root said. ""A long, slow, hard grind."" Root said he didn't feel comfortable ""muscling it"" so compiled his knock in a different way. ""For us to do it differently and still get the win is a good sign for us,"" Root said. Earlier, Sri Lanka was dismissed for 326 soon after lunch, collapsing following the departure of No. 7 batter Kamindu Mendis for 113 - the third century of his four-match test career. Dinesh Chandimal was the last batter out for 79, with the final four wickets tumbling in 26 balls. Sri Lanka added 122 runs on the fourth day after resuming its second innings on 204-6. ""Our mistakes were made in the first innings and that cost us the match,"" Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva said. ""Lots of good individual performances. There are positives here and there.

Off-spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz and left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan, who was a lawmaker in the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, shared seven wickets after the pace bowlers mopped up the top order to give Bangladesh its maiden win in 14 test matches against Pakistan. Openers Zakir Hasan and Shadman Islam were unbeaten on 15 and 9, respectively, as Bangladesh reached 30-0 at the stroke of the tea interval for only its seventh away test win and the first since beating New Zealand at Mount Maunganui in January 2022. Pakistan, which conceded a 117-run first innings lead despite declaring at 448-6, was bowled out by a disciplined pace and spin attack after it resumed on 23-1 and still 94 runs behind. ""It's an amazing feeling and really a special moment for us,"" Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said. ""Over the last one month, we had a difficult (political) situation, but this win will bring a little bit of smile."" Mohammad Rizwan followed his career-best unbeaten 171 to top-score with 51 but most of his teammates were guilty of falling to rash shots coupled with some aggressive field placings by Shanto. Mehidy picked up 4-21 and Shakib 3-44 while the three fast bowlers Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud and Nahid Rana snared one wicket each. ""It's really nice the way everyone showed character in such hot conditions,"" Shanto said while praising his batters for posting a formidable score of 565 in the first innings. ""We knew if we bowled in right areas, we can win this game ... and today both Shakib and Miraz used the conditions very well."" Earlier, in a dramatic first session Bangladesh set up its victory as Pakistan limped to 108-6 and lost five wickets. Captain Shan Masood (14) was dismissed in the second over of the day when Hasan found a faint edge and had the Pakistan skipper caught behind. Masood argued with onfield umpire Richard Kettleborough for the second time in the test match after he was also caught behind in a controversial manner in the first innings, but the television replays clearly suggested the left-hander had a tickle on the ball after Bangladesh went for a successful television referral. Hasan should have had Babar Azam out for a pair of ducks in the game, but wicketkeeper Litton Das spilled a simple catch off the first ball Babar faced. Babar tried to break the shackles and hit three boundaries before he was out to fast bowler Rana (1-30) when on 22. Pakistan's middle-order batters were guilty of throwing away their wickets against the two spinners, Shakib and Mehidy. First innings century-maker Saud Shakeel needlessly tried to play an extravagant shot against Shakib and got stumped for zero for the first time in his short test career. Abdullah Shafique also ran out of patience and went for an over ambitious shot against Shakib and top edged a catch to point before Mehidy found the outside edge of Salman Ali Agha's bat in his second over. Bangladesh kept up the pressure on Pakistan after the break as Mehidy picked up three wickets after lunch. Rizwan under edged a sweep against the offspinner back onto his stumps soon after completing his half century and then No. 11 Mohammad Ali was out leg before wicket. The defeat extended Pakistan's barren run in red-ball cricket at home to five losses and four draws since it last beat South Africa at Rawalpindi in 2021. ""We have to look upon the mistakes we've made collectively and work on them,"" Masood said after losing his fourth successive test match since he was named test captain before the series in Australia late last year. ""I apologize to the whole nation and hope we will do much better in the next game."" The second test will also be played at Rawalpindi from next Friday after it was moved from Karachi due to the ongoing construction work at the National Bank Stadium.","test, hasan, the, shakib, ali, kettleborough, win, first, wickets, captain, rawalpindi, agha, mehidy, miraz, najmul, islam, litton, shanto, shakeel, richard"

The tourists had Pakistan on the mat at 16-3 after wet patches on the outfield of Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium from early morning rain had delayed the toss for 4-1/2 hours. But left-handed opener Ayub, who hit 56, and vice-captain Shakeel, unbeaten on 57, shared an aggressive 98-run fourth wicket stand in almost two hours before seamer Hasan Mahmud (2-33) broke through in the final session and had Ayub caught in third slip. Ayub patiently saw off the early seam and swing of Bangladesh pace bowlers before striking four boundaries and a six in his 98-ball knock. Wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Rizwan was 24 not out at stumps. ""The wicket was difficult early on and Bangladesh bowlers didn't give us the margin,"" Ayub said. ""I have a good understanding with Saud and when there's partnerships, things do look easy."" After the wet patches dried up in bright sunshine, captain Najmul Hossain Shanto won the all-important toss and his decision to field brought Bangladesh early success as the fast bowlers swung the ball well on a damp wicket. Hasan lured Abdullah Shafique (2) to go for an early ambitious drive and Zakir Hasan took a spectacular acrobatic catch in the gully while diving full length to his right side. Pakistan skipper Shan Masood fell to a contentious caught behind decision from television umpire Darren Gough as left-arm fast bowler Shoriful Islam's (2-30) delivery jagged back into the left-hander. Gough ruled in Bangladesh's favor after the tourists went for a TV referral of on-field decision of not out. Masood argued with on-field umpire Richard Kettleborough before walking off in disbelief. Pakistan former all-format captain Babar Azam's struggle in red-ball cricket continued for the seventh successive test match as he tried to flick Shoriful down the leg side and was brilliantly snapped by wicketkeeper Litton Das without scoring. Ayub and Shakeel then staged a good recovery and negated the off-spin of Mehidy Hasan Miraz with sweep shots and the pace of tall Nahid Rana, who conceded 48 off his 10 overs without taking a wicket, before Hasan broke through. ""It's very important to get help from the fielders and some of the catches they took were awesome today,"" Hasan said. ""The wicket was a bit tacky and we tried to bowl in the right areas. We will try to continue bowl in the right zones tomorrow and take them down to somewhere 200 (runs)."" The two-test series is part of ICC World Test Championship in which Pakistan is ranked sixth and Bangladesh eighth, just ahead of last-placed West Indies. Rawalpindi will also host the second test starting after the Pakistan Cricket Board moved the game due to construction work going on at the National Bank Stadium ahead of next year's Champions Trophy.","test, the, hasan, cricket, wicket, darren, gough, shoriful, patches, mahmud, rawalpindi, bowlers, ayub, najmul, islam, shanto, shakeel, litton, hossain, masood"

Shadman, playing his first test match after almost 30 months, made 93 in more than 5 1/2 hours of resilient batting before he was clean bowled by Mohammad Ali (1-42) at the stroke of tea. Bangladesh still trails Pakistan by 132 runs after Mohammad Rizwan and Saud Shakeel hit centuries in the home team's 448-6 declared. Mushfiqur Rahim (55 not out) and Litton Das (52 not out) are at the crease. They added an enterprising 98 runs in the latter half of the first session. Both batters stood firm against Shaheen Shah Afridi (0-55) and Naseem Shah (1-77), who couldn't separate the two with the second new ball late on Day 3. Das reached his fifty off 52 balls when he struck three fours and a pulled six in Shah's over. Mushfiqur also made a well composed half century in his first test after 10 months. ""It's an even game and we still have a lead of 130-odd,"" Pakistan assistant coach Azhar Mahmood said. ""We were not disciplined in the last 12 overs ... but if we managed to take a lead of 60-70 runs, we can still be in this test match."" Mominul Haque hit an attractive 50 off 76 balls and, together with Shadman, revived Bangladesh innings by combining in a 94-run third-wicket stand after the visitors lost two early wickets in an extended three-hour first session. ""Litton Das is a classical player and that one over (of Naseem Shah) got the game going in our hands,"" said Mominul. ""As a senior player ... I shouldn't have just got a fifty. I almost batted three or four sessions (and) it's a crime to get out for fifty."" Pakistan broke that threatening stand soon after lunch when Mominul's off stump was knocked over by Khurram Shahzad (2-47), who posed problems to the Bangladesh left-handers while bowling around the wicket and was the standout seam bowler of the day. Pakistan went for an unsuccessful lbw television referral before Mushfiqur had scored. Shadman, on 57, successfully overturned an onfield lbw decision against him by spinner Salman Ali Agha. Shadman accelerated after that and struck six more boundaries before Ali got his first success off a sharp incoming delivery as the left-hander departed after hitting 12 boundaries in his 183-ball patient knock. With the old soft ball not doing much for the pace bowlers on a greenish wicket, part-time off-spinner Saim Ayub got his first test wicket in his first over when Shakib Al Hasan was caught at cover by skipper Shan Masood after making nearly a run-a-ball 15 before Musfiqur and Das dominated against the pace of Afridi and Shah. Earlier, Shah provided Pakistan an early break when Rizwan plucked a brilliant left-handed catch in front of first slip to dismiss Zakir Hasan (12) in the fifth over of the day after Bangladesh had resumed on 27-0. Shah conceded just 15 runs in his first 12 overs and restrained Bangladesh's progress in the first hour. Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto struggled to score 16 off 42 balls before Shahzad had his off stump knocked back as Bangladesh slipped to 53-2 before Shadman and Mominul took charge. Shadman reached his half century with a pulled boundary in Shah's last delivery before the first session as both left-handers accelerated in the last hour. Mominul was more comfortable against the pace and kept the scoreboard moving as he upper cut Shah to the third-man boundary and followed it with another four through wide mid-on.","test, first, the, azhar, ali, his, handers, mahmood, hour, century, wicket, runs, saim, agha, pace, ayub, shah, najmul, shanto, hossain"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/bangladesh-secular-culture-under-attack,Bangladesh: Secular culture under attack,Anisur Rahman,2024-08-23 10:25:54,"After the shocking fall of Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh enters a new era with a non-partisan government headed by US-backed businessman and Nobel laureate, banker Muhammad Yunus. The Hasina regime fell in a massive student-led uprising. Following the end of her rule, the country experienced widespread destruction of sculptures, academies, museums and libraries. The devastation included statues of the country's founding president, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Nobel laureate Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, pioneer modern Bengali artist Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin, pioneering feminist writer Begum Rokeya and the country's 1971 liberation war heroes. The perpetrators looted banks, zoos, shops and houses. The culprits also raped many girls and women. They burned hotels where many, including foreigners, were killed. They vandalised Hindu temples, killed and evicted many ethnic minority families, particularly Hindus. Secular-minded Muslim families were also under attack. Hundreds of children, women and men were killed. They burned music studios, theatres, artworks and musical instruments. They destroyed mazars (shrines) similar to the way the ISIS did in Iraq and Syria. Furthermore, they even demolished the Indira Gandhi International Cultural Centre and the National Academy for Children. They destroyed transportation, schools and hospitals. Not only that, they also vandalised prisons and helped many prisoners escape. Who are they? Do they seem like Islamist fanatics carrying the legacy of the Taliban, ISIS or al-Qaida? What continues to happen in this Muslim-majority secular country is alarming. Does it not resemble the events that took place in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq and Syria in the 2010s? What we are witnessing in Bangladesh today is difficult to describe in words. Despite emerging as a secular, progressive, socialist country through the War of Liberation in 1971 under the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's fundamental principles have been eroded by successive regimes, both military and civilian, over the last five decades. Sheikh Hasina's regime was credited with significant development but was also criticised for its failure to control corruption and being 'authoritarian'. She attempted to balance secularity with Islamist forces in a country where 91 per cent of the 170 million population is Muslim. In this context, more than 80 per cent of the Muslim population desires Sharia law in Bangladesh, similar to Afghanistan, Morocco, Niger, Pakistan, and Iraq, according to an analysis by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre. Knowing this, instead of finding other ways to curb the growing fanaticism, Hasina prioritised compromising with Islamist groups to maintain control and run the country under a liberal, semi-progressive capitalist regime. Despite the secular image of her party, the Awami League, the leadership accepted many demands from Islamist groups that contradicted the party's manifesto and the principles of the country's first constitution. In the 1980s, a military ruler imposed Islam as the state religion, disregarding the country's 1972 constitution, which was founded on four principles: Democracy, Socialism, Nationality and Secularism. The country's secularism and socialism began to deteriorate in the late 1970s after the assassination of its founding leaders, and Bangladesh has yet to fully recover. The situation has now reached its worst point concerning the secular and progressive culture. After the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government, Hindu families in some 30 of the 64 districts came under attack. Many are trying to flee. Foreigners and diplomats are leaving their posts. Amidst this fanaticism, authorities have failed to maintain control. In some instances, soldiers were seen standing by as mere spectators. Military personnel were even observed participating in the destruction of the founding father's statue. Immediately after the fall of Sheikh Hasina's regime, the army chief held a meeting with leaders of the banned Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, among others. The leader of the military-backed, non-partisan government in Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, has been friendly with both Islamist and nationalist groups in Bangladesh and with Western countries. However, he has not been friendly with the political group that supports the 1971 revolution. Many accuse him of being a 'blood-sucking' banker who exploits the poor and a 'Western favourite' advocate for privatisation. This could ultimately hinder the country's return to its roots as a welfare state with a secular culture and democracy. The current circumstances suggest that the 'Islamist' and military-backed Yunus regime could be a replica of Hamid Karzai's government in Afghanistan. If this speculation proves wrong, it will be a relief for all.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/nobel-laureate-yunus-will-head-bangladeshs-interim-government-after-unrest-ousted-hasina,Nobel laureate Yunus will head Bangladesh's interim government after unrest ousted Hasina,Associated Press,2024-08-07 10:11:20,"DHAKA, AUGUST 7 Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus will head Bangladesh's interim government after longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country amid a mass uprising that left hundreds of people dead and pushed the South Asian nation to the brink of chaos. The decision, announced early Wednesday by Joynal Abedin, the press secretary of the country's figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin, came during a meeting that included military chiefs, organizers of the student protests that helped drive Hasina from power, prominent business leaders and civil society members. A longtime political opponent of Hasina, Yunus is expected to return soon from Paris, where he is advising Olympic organizers, media reports said. An economist and banker, he was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets. Yunus has been hailed for bringing thousands out of poverty through Grameen Bank, which he founded in 1983, and which makes small loans to businesspeople who wouldn't qualify for regular bank loans. Other members of the new government would be decided soon, after discussions with political parties and other stakeholders, Abedin said. The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the way for an interim administration and new elections. Shahabuddin also ordered the release of opposition leader Khaleda Zia from house arrest, a longtime Hasina rival who was convicted on corruption charges in 2018. The streets of Dhaka, the capital, were calm Tuesday, a day after violence swept parts of the country amid Hasina's sudden departure. On Tuesday, jubilant protesters thronged the ousted leader's residence, some posing for selfies with soldiers guarding the building after Monday's wave of looting. The Bangladesh Police Association went on strike after police stations and security officials were attacked across the country Monday. The association said ""many"" officers had been killed but gave no number. Officers would not return to work unless their safety is assured, the association said. It also apologized for police attacks on student protesters, saying officers were ""forced to open fire."" Yunus, who had called Hasina's resignation the country's ""second liberation day,"" had faced corruption charges during her rule that he derided as politically motivated. He could not immediately be reached for comment, but a key organizer of the protests, Nahid Islam, said he had agreed to head the interim administration. Islam said protesters would propose more names for the Cabinet and suggested that it would be difficult for those in power to ignore their wishes. Hasina fled to India by helicopter as protesters defied a military curfew to march on the capital, with thousands eventually storming her residence and other buildings associated with her party and family. The unrest began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs, which critics said favored people with connections to her party. But they soon grew into a broader challenge to Hasina's 15-year rule, which was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents. The government's violent response to the demonstrations, which killed about 300 people in just a few weeks, only fueled the protests more. The quick move to choose Yunus came after Hasina's resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises. The military wields significant influence in a country that has seen more than 20 coups or coup attempts since its independence from Pakistan in 1971. Military chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman said Monday he had taken temporary control while a new government is formed. Amid the celebrations, student Juairia Karim said it was a historic day. ""Today we are getting what we deserve,"" she said. ""Everyone is happy, everyone is cheerful."" But the country was still counting the toll of weeks of violence that produced some of its worst bloodshed since its war of independence. Many fear that Hasina's departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and climate change. Violence in just the few days surrounding Hasina's resignation killed at least 109 people - including 14 police officers, and left hundreds of others injured, according to media reports which could not be independently confirmed. In the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported. There are growing fears among the country's Hindu minority, which has been targeted in the past during political unrest and which has long been seen as pro-Hasina, that they could again face attacks. Local reports of violence against Hindu leaders and other minorities could not be confirmed. ""Hindus are very afraid,"" Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari, leader of the Bangladesh branch of a Hindu movement, told the IANS news service. ""Hindus are very afraid that they could be attacked anytime. This is because whenever the government falls, minorities are affected."" The EU ambassador to Bangladesh, Charles Whitley, said on the social media platform X that European diplomats were ""very concerned"" about reports of anti-minority violence. Opposition politicians have publicly called on people not to attack minority groups, while student leaders asked supporters to guard Hindu temples and other places of worship. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party on Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a ""transitional moment on our democratic path."" ""It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands,"" Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on X. ""I think the next leader of the country should learn from the students that if anyone becomes corrupt, a traitor, or takes any action against the country, they will face the same fate,"" said Mohammad Jahirul Islam, a student in Dhaka. Hasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the United States and the United Kingdom denounced the result as not credible. After fleeing Dhaka, Hasina landed Monday at a military airfield near New Delhi and met Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. She planned to travel to the United Kingdom, it said. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told Parliament that Hasina ""at very short notice requested approval to come for the moment to India.""","the, hasina, bangladesh, nobel, military, opposition, indian, hindu, minority, student, longtime, yunus, doval, rule, juairia, news, officers, association, shahabuddin, express"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/interim-leader-muhammad-yunus-takes-helm-in-bangladesh-to-seek-peace-and-prepare-elections,"Interim leader Muhammad Yunus takes helm in Bangladesh, to seek peace and prepare elections",Associated Press,2024-08-08 21:37:49,"DHAKA, AUGUST 8 Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh's interim government Thursday after an uprising prompted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to step down and flee to India. The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following weeks of violence in which student activists led an uprising against what was considered Hasina's increasingly autocratic 15-year rule. Bangladesh's figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief advisor, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in presence of foreign diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka. No representatives of Hasina's party were present. Sixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members Yunus as interim leader were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military. Hasina quit on Monday after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina's party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina's 15-year rule as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiraling violence. Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role, and returned home earlier Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka. In his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. ""Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,"" Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. ""It has immense possibility."" On Wednesday in Paris, Yunus had called for calm and an end to all partisan violence. Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh's politics - a reversal from what he'd said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India. The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration. On Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case. Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a ""bloodsucker"" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations. The chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued after Hasina's resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media. The unrest began in mid-July with protests over the quota system, but grew into a broader challenge over an administration that was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents. Joy, Hasina's son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics despite what he said have been attacks on Hasina's Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics. ""If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,"" he said. ""The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh."" Overnight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, and police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help. The quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina's resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises. Many fear that Hasina's departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States. Hasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents.

Yunus was on his way home from Paris on Wednesday. In his first statement since he was named as the head of an interim government, Yunus congratulated the students for ""taking the lead in making our Second Victory Day possible."" He also appealed to them, members of political parties and other people to stay calm. Referring to acts of violence that happened after Hasina's resignation, Yunus said, ""Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country."" Bangladesh's military chief said Wednesday that the interim government headed by Yunus would be sworn in on Thursday night. Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised address that those responsible for violence since Hasina's resignation would be brought to justice. The military chief - flanked by the chiefs of the navy and air force - said that he had spoken to Yunus and would receive him at the airport. Zaman said he was hopeful that Yunus would take the situation to a ""beautiful democratic"" process. Speaking to reporters in Paris, Yunus said ""I'm looking forward to going back home and seeing what's happening there, and how we can organize ourselves to get out of the trouble that we are in.″ Asked when elections would be held, he put his hands up as if to indicate it was too early to say. ″I'll go and talk to them. I'm just fresh in this whole area.″ The latest development came after a tribunal in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case, involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He was on bail in the case. On Wednesday, ailing opposition leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia also urged all not to follow the path of destruction in Bangladesh as she addressed her supporters from a hospital bed at a rally in Dhaka. It was her first public speech since 2018, when she was convicted of corruption charges and jailed. ""No destruction, no anger, and no revenge, we need love and peace to rebuild our country,"" she said using a video link. The rally by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party came a day after Zia's release from house arrest. Her son and the acting head of the party, Tarique Rahman also addressed the crowd online from London, where he has been living in exile since 2008. Rahman faces several criminal cases and was convicted of corruption and a grenade attack, charges dismissed by supporters as politically motivated. Zia, who ruled the country from 2001 to 2006, was convicted on corruption charges in 2018 and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Her party said the charges were designed to keep her away from politics. On Wednesday, the streets of Dhaka, the capital, were calm two days after violence gripped the country amid Hasina's sudden departure. The students were seen cleaning streets and managing traffic in parts of Dhaka as police including traffic police disappeared amid violent attacks on police stations in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country. Bangladesh's President Mohammed Shahabuddin, a symbolic figure who is acting as the chief executive now under the constitution, also asked the security officials on Wednesday to take stern action against troublemakers. The country's newly appointed police chief Mainul Islam ordered police officers to return to work by Thursday evening to protect the people's lives and property. The Bangladesh Police Association went on strike after police stations and security officials were attacked across the country Monday. The president dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for an interim administration that is expected to schedule new elections but it's not clear when those elections will take place. Shahabuddin named Yunus as the head of an interim government, in consultation with the army and student leaders. He has been a longtime opponent of Hasina. An economist and banker, Yunus was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets. Violence in days surrounding Hasina's resignation killed at least 109 people - including 14 police officers, and left hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. Reports said more attacks took place across the country also on Tuesday. The looting of firearms was also reported in local media. In the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported. Homes of former ministers and MPs belonging to Hasina's party were looted, torched or vandalized. People were seen on social media taking valuables from the home of Hasina's younger sister in Dhaka's Gulshan area. Four separate neighbors told The Associated Press that the lootings took place at her home. Local media also reported that many of the dead in two days of violence since her resignation included ruling party officials, mostly outside Dhaka. There were also reports of violence against Hindu leaders and other minorities. Those details could not be independently confirmed. Opposition politicians have publicly called on people not to attack minority groups, while student leaders asked supporters to guard Hindu temples and other places of worship.

Known as the ""banker to the poorest of the poor"" and a longtime critic of the ousted Sheikh Hasina, Yunus will act as a caretaker premier until new elections are held. The decision followed a meeting late Tuesday that included student protest leaders, military chiefs, civil society members and business leaders. Hasina was forced to flee Monday after weeks of protests over a quota system for allocating government jobs turned into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule, which was marked by a rising economy but an increasingly authoritarian streak. Hasina's departure has plunged bangladesh into a political crisis. The army has temporarily taken control, but it is unclear what its role would be in an interim government after the president dissolved Parliament on Tuesday to pave the way for elections. Student leaders who organized the protests have wanted Yunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics as an adviser to its organizers, to lead an interim government. He could not immediately be reached for comment, but key student leader Nahid Islam asserted that Yunus agreed to step in during a discussion with them. The 83-year-old is a well-known critic and political opponent of Hasina. Yunus called her resignation the country's ""second liberation day."" She once called him a ""bloodsucker."" An economist and banker by profession, Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering the use of microcredit to help impoverished people, particularly women. The Nobel Peace Prize committee credited Yunus and his Grameen Bank ""for their efforts to create economic and social development from below."" Yunus founded Grameen Bank in 1983 to provide small loans to entrepreneurs who would not normally qualify to receive them. The bank's success in lifting people out of poverty led to similar microfinancing efforts in other countries. He ran into trouble with Hasina in 2008, when her administration launched a series of investigations into him. He had announced he would form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government but did not follow through. During the investigations, Hasina accused Yunus of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as the head of Grameen Bank. Yunus denied the allegations. Hasina's government began reviewing the bank's activities in 2011, and Yunus was fired as managing director for allegedly violating government retirement regulations. He was put on trial in 2013 on charges of receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize and royalties from a book. He later faced more charges involving other companies he created, including Grameen Telecom, which is part of the country's largest mobile phone company, GrameenPhone, a subsidiary of Norwegian telecom giant Telenor. In 2023, some former Grameen Telecom workers filed a case against Yunus accusing him of siphoning off their job benefits. He denied the accusations. Earlier this year, a special judge's court in Bangladesh indicted Yunus and 13 others on charges over the $2 million embezzlement case. Yunus pleaded not guilty and is out on bail for now. Yunus' supporters say he has been targeted because of his frosty relations with Hasina. Yunus was born in 1940 in Chittagong, a seaport city in Bangladesh. He received his PhD from Vanderbilt University in the United States and taught there briefly before returning to Bangladesh. In a 2004 interview with The Associated Press, Yunus said he had a ""eureka movement"" to establish Grameen Bank when he met a poor woman weaving bamboo stools who was struggling pay her debts.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/bangladesh-pakistan-officials-resume-bilateral-talks-after-15-years-gap,"Bangladesh, Pakistan officials resume bilateral talks after 15 years' gap",Associated Press,2025-04-17 21:07:31,"DHAKA, APRIL 17 Foreign ministry officials from Bangladesh's interim government and Pakistan resumed talks on Thursday after a 15-year gap, as the two South Asian Muslim-majority nations attempted to ease strained relations. Under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted in August in a students-led mass uprising, Bangladesh expanded relations with neighboring India in every sector. But ties with India have become increasingly tense. Bangladesh's interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, has criticized India for sheltering Hasina in the country and sought her extradition without any positive response from India. Yunus has meanwhile sought to improve relations with Pakistan, India's rival. In recent months he met Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif several times, and a high-level Bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to Pakistan in January and held talks with Pakistan's army chief General Asim Munir. In February, Bangladesh's navy took part in a multinational maritime exercise organized by Pakistan off the Karachi coast. After Hasina's exit, Bangladesh and Pakistan resumed direct trading for the first time in years. Direct flights between the countries are expected to resume soon and visa procedures have been eased while India stopped visas for Bangladeshis, except for medical emergencies. After Thursday's talks in Dhaka between Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary Jashim Uddin and his Pakistani counterpart, Uddin said Bangladesh raised historically ""unsettled issues"" with Pakistan, including a formal public apology for atrocities allegedly committed by Pakistani troops in 1971 during Bangladesh's war of independence. India helped Bangladesh win independence through a nine-month war against then West Pakistan, now Pakistan. Hasina's Awami League party regularly criticizes Pakistan for alleged atrocities during the war, when Bangladesh says about 3 million people were killed and about 200,000 women were raped by Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan rejects the claims and has never officially apologized. Local media reported earlier that Yunus' government was preparing to formally raise its demand for $4.52 billion in financial compensation from Pakistan. Uddin said the issue of the compensation was raised in Thursday's meeting. ""These issues need to be resolved for having a solid foundation of our relations,"" Uddin said Thursday. The two sides also discussed expansion of trade and commerce and increasing cooperation in agriculture and other sectors, he added. The last such consultation between the two countries was held in Islamabad in 2010 after Hasina came to power in a 2008 election with a landslide victory.","hasina, pakistani, bangladesh, pakistan, yunus, asim, munir, shehbaz, sharif, jashim, uddin, awami, nobel, muhammad, compensation, about, dhaka, war, gap, prize"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/high-stakes-ai-summit-in-paris-world-leaders-tech-titans-and-challenging-diplomatic-talks,"High-stakes AI summit in Paris: World leaders, tech titans and challenging diplomatic talks",Associated Press,2025-02-10 15:30:03,"PARIS, FEBRUARY 10 Major world leaders are meeting for an AI summit in Paris, where challenging diplomatic talks are expected as tech titans fight for dominance in the fast-moving technology industry. Heads of state, top government officials, CEOs and scientists from around 100 countries are participating in the two-day international summit from Monday. High-profile attendees include U.S. Vice President JD Vance, on his first overseas trip since taking office, and Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing. ""We're living a technology and scientific revolution we've rarely seen,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said Sunday on national television France 2. France and Europe must seize the ""opportunity"" because AI ""will enable us to live better, learn better, work better, care better and it's up to us to put this artificial intelligence at the service of human beings,"" he said. Vance's debut abroad The summit will give some European leaders a chance to meet Vance for the first time. The 40-year-old vice president was just 18 months into his time as Ohio's junior senator when Donald Trump picked him as his running mate. Vance was joined by his wife Usha and their three children - Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel - for the trip to Europe. They were greeted on French soil Monday morning by Manuel Valls, the minister for Overseas France, and the U.S. Embassy's charge d'affaires, David McCawley. On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the menu. Vance, like President Donald Trump, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office. Vance will attend later this week the Munich Security Conference, where he may meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Leaders in Europe have been watching carefully Trump's recent statements on threats to impose tariffs on the European Union, take control of Greenland and his suggestion that Palestinians clear out Gaza once the fighting in the Israel-Hamas conflict ends - an idea that's been flatly rejected by Arab allies. Fostering AI advances The summit, which gathers major players such as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, aims at fostering AI advances in sectors like health, education, environment and culture. A global public-private partnership named ""Current AI"" is to be launched to support large-scale initiatives that serve the general interest. The Paris summit ""is the first time we'll have had such a broad international discussion in one place on the future of AI,"" said Linda Griffin, vice president of public policy at Mozilla. ""I see it as a norm-setting moment."" Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, noted an opportunity to shape AI governance in a new direction by ""moving away from this concentration of power amongst a handful of private actors and building this public interest AI instead."" However, it remains unclear if the U.S. will support such initiatives. French organizers also hope the summit will lead to major investment announcements in Europe. France is to announce AI private investments worth a total of 109 billion euros ($113 billion) over the coming years, Macron said, presenting it as ""the equivalent"" of Trump's Stargate AI data centers project. Indian PM co-hosting the summit India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is co-hosting the summit with Macron in an effort to involve more global actors in AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a U.S.-China battle. India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid ""perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world."" Macron will also travel Wednesday with Modi to the southern city port of Marseille to inaugurate a new Indian consulate and visit the ITER nuclear research site. France has become a key defense partner for India, with talks underway on purchasing 26 Rafale fighter jets and three Scorpene submarines. Officials in New Delhi said discussions are in final phase and the deal could be inked in a few weeks.","ai, the, summit, president, vice, vance, trump, guoqing, stargate, france, zhang, french, leaders, macron, emmanuel, overseas, actors, narendra, volodymyr, zelenskyy"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/modis-party-wins-most-seats-in-high-stakes-new-delhi-polls-for-first-time-in-27-years,Modi's party wins most seats in high-stakes New Delhi polls for first time in 27 years,Associated Press,2025-02-09 20:20:23,"NEW DELHI, FEBRUARY 9 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist party won the most seats in the high-stakes state legislature election in India's federal territory, including New Delhi, for the first time in over a quarter-century, according to official data on Saturday. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party won 47 seats in the 70-member assembly that includes India's capital of 20 million people, ousting the Aam Aadmi Party, or AAP, that ruled New Delhi since 2015. The AAP won 22 seats. The outcome of the race in one remaining seat had yet to be declared, according to the Election Commission of India. India's main opposition Congress party lost on all seats for the third consecutive term. In a major upset, the AAP founder and leader Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy, Manish Sisodia, lost their seats despite their party having built widespread support with its welfare policies and anti-corruption movement. ""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility,"" Kejriwal said in a video statement while congratulating the BJP on its victory. He said he hoped that the BJP would fulfil its election promises. ""We have done a lot of work in the field of health, education, and infrastructure in the last 10 years,"" Kejriwal said. ""We will not only play the role of a constructive opposition but will also remain among the people and continue to serve them."" Waving party flags and posters of Modi, supporters of the BJP chanted slogans and danced outside its headquarters in the capital as vote results began trickling with most exit polls predicting the party's win. Parties made pledges on schools and health services The BJP's Amit Shah, who is India's powerful home minister, said his party's victory signified that ""people can't be misled with lies every time."" He said under the leadership of Modi, the BJP would make New Delhi ""the world's No. 1 capital by fulfilling all promises."" ""Our victory is a sign of the people's faith in Prime Minister Modi's vision of progress,"" he said in a statement. Saturday's victory is seen as a big boost for the BJP after it failed to secure a majority on its own in last year's national election but formed the government with coalition partners. It gained some lost ground by winning two state elections in northern Haryana and western Maharashtra states last year. Ahead of the election, Modi's party slashed income taxes on the salaried middle class, one of its key voting blocs, in the federal budget. During the electioneering, both Modi and Kejriwal offered to revamp government schools and provide free health services and electricity, along with a monthly stipend of over 2,000 rupees ($25) to poor women. Misusing federal investigation agencies Kejriwal was arrested last year along with two key party leaders on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. They have denied the accusations, saying they are part of a political conspiracy. The Supreme Court allowed the release of Kejriwal and other ministers on bail. Kejriwal later relinquished the chief minister's post to his most senior party leader, Atishi, who won her seat on Saturday. Opposition parties widely condemned Kejriwal's arrest, accusing Modi's government of misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken political opponents. They pointed to several raids, arrests and corruption investigations of key opposition figures before the national election. Kejriwal formed the AAP in 2012 after tapping into public anger over corruption scandals. His pro-poor policies have focused on fixing state-run schools and providing cheap electricity, free health care and bus transport for women. In 2020, the AAP won 62 out of 70 seats in a landslide victory in the last state legislature election, leaving the BJP with eight and the Congress party with none. The BJP was voted out of power in Delhi in 1998 by the Congress party, which ran the government for 15 years.","party, seats, election, modi, the, kejriwal, aap, opposition, bjp, victory, delhi, arvind, legislature, bharatiya, amit, corruption, stakes, india, quarter, state"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/midair-collision-kills-67-people-in-the-deadliest-us-air-disaster-in-almost-a-quarter-century,Midair collision kills 67 people in the deadliest US air disaster in almost a quarter century,Associated Press,2025-01-31 10:39:12,"ARLINGTON, JANUARY 31 A midair collision between an Army helicopter and a jetliner killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft, officials said Thursday, as they scrutinized the actions of the military pilot in the country's deadliest aviation disaster in almost a quarter century. At least 28 bodies were pulled from the icy waters of the Potomac River after the helicopter apparently flew into the path of the American Airlines regional jet late Wednesday while it was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport, just across the river from Washington, officials said. The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew members, and three soldiers were aboard the helicopter. President Donald Trump told a White House news conference that no one survived. ""We are now at the point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation,"" said John Donnelly, the fire chief in the nation's capital. The crash occurred before 9 p.m. in some of the most tightly controlled and monitored airspace in the world, just over 3 miles (about 4.8 kilometers) south of the White House and the Capitol. Air crash investigations can take months, and federal investigators told reporters they would not speculate on the cause. National Transportation Safety Board investigators recovered the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder from the Bombardier CRJ700 airplane, agency spokesperson Peter Knudson said. They were at the agency's labs for evaluation. The plane was found upside-down in three sections in waist-deep water, and first responders were searching miles of the Potomac, Donnelly said. The helicopter wreckage was also found. Images from the river showed boats around the partly submerged wing and the mangled wreckage of the plane's fuselage. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said the plane was making a normal approach when ""the military aircraft came into the path"" of the jet. One air traffic controller was responsible for coordinating helicopter traffic and arriving and departing planes when the collision happened, according to a report by the Federal Aviation Administration that was obtained by The Associated Press. Those duties are often divided between two people, but the airport typically combines the roles at 9:30 p.m, once traffic begins to slow down. On Wednesday the tower supervisor directed that they be combined earlier. ""The position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,"" the report said. A person familiar with the matter, however, said the tower staffing that night was at a normal level. The positions are regularly combined when controllers need to step away from the console for breaks, during shift changes or when air traffic is slow, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. The Federal Aviation Administration has long struggled with a shortage of air traffic controllers. Officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet arrived from Wichita, Kansas, carrying, among others, a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches, and four union steamfitters from the Washington area. A top Army aviation official said the crew of the helicopter, a Black Hawk, was ""very experienced"" and familiar with the congested flying that occurs daily around the city. ""Both pilots had flown this specific route before, at night. This wasn't something new to either one of them,"" said Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation. The helicopter's maximum allowed altitude at the time was 200 feet (about 60 meters), Koziol said. It was not immediately clear whether it exceeded that limit, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said altitude seemed to be a factor in the collision. Koziol said investigators need to analyze the flight data before making conclusions about altitude. Trump opened the news conference with a moment of silence honoring the crash victims, calling it an ""hour of anguish"" for the country. But he spent most of his time casting political blame, lashing out at former President Joe Biden's administration and diversity efforts at the Federal Aviation Administration, saying they had led to slipping standards - even as he acknowledged that the cause of the crash was unknown. Without evidence, Trump blamed air traffic controllers, the helicopter pilots and Democratic policies at federal agencies. He claimed that the FAA was ""actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative."" Inside Reagan National, the mood was somber Thursday as stranded passengers waited for flights to resume, sidestepping camera crews and staring out the windows at the Potomac, where recovery efforts were barely visible in the distance. Aster Andemicael had been there since the previous evening with her older adult father, who was flying to Indiana to visit relatives. She spent much of the long night thinking about the victims and their families. ""I've been crying since yesterday,"" Andemicael said, her voice cracking. ""This is devastating."" Flights resumed around midday. The deadliest plane crash since November 2001 Wednesday's crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when an American Airlines flight slammed into a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport, killing all 260 people aboard and five people on the ground. The last major fatal crash involving a U.S. commercial airline occurred in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane was killed, along with one person on the ground, bringing the total death toll to 50. Experts often highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, however. The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93 chance of dying in a motor vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the Department of Transportation tell a similar story. But the airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots no matter how ideal the conditions. They must navigate hundreds of other commercial planes, military aircraft and restricted areas around sensitive sites. Just over 24 hours before the fatal collision, a different regional jet had to go around for a second chance at landing at Reagan National after it was advised about a military helicopter nearby, according to flight tracking sites and control logs. It landed safely minutes later. Tragedy stuns Wichita The crash devastated the Kansas city, which prides itself on being in America's heartland. Wichita hosted the U.S. Figure Skating Championships this year for the first time, along with training camps for top young skaters. The city has been a major hub for the aircraft industry since the early days of commercial flight, and it is home to the U.S. headquarters for Bombardier, which manufactured the jetliner. So many regional workers have jobs tied to the industry that the area's economy slumps when sales dip. Several hundred people gathered in the city council chambers for a prayer vigil. ""We will get through this, but the only way we will get through this is together,"" said the Rev. Pamela Hughes Mason of St. Paul AME Church. Collision happened in tightly controlled airspace Flight 5342 was inbound to Reagan National at an altitude of about 400 feet (122 meters) and a speed of about 140 mph (225 kph) when it rapidly lost altitude over the Potomac, according to data from its radio transponder. The Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-700 twin-engine jet, manufactured in 2004, can be configured to carry up to 70 passengers. A few minutes before the crash, air traffic controllers directed the jet to a shorter runway, and flight-tracking sites showed that it adjusted its approach. Less than 30 seconds before the collision, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the arriving plane in sight. A crewmember said the aircraft was in sight and requested ""visual separation"" - allowing it to fly closer than otherwise might be allowed if pilots did not see the plane. Controllers approved the request. Seconds later, the two aircraft collided.","the, flight, crash, plane, helicopter, collision, bombardier, air, aviation, aircraft, traffic, jet, midair, airspace, airlines, pilots, reagan, pamela, isom, hawk"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/passenger-jet-collides-with-army-helicopter-while-landing-at-reagan-washington-national-airport,Passenger jet collides with Army helicopter while landing at Reagan Washington National Airport,Associated Press,2025-01-30 09:58:06,"ARLINGTON, JANUARY 30 A passenger jet collided Wednesday with an Army helicopter while landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, prompting a large search-and-rescue operation in the nearby Potomac River. There was no immediate word on casualties or the cause of the collision, but all takeoffs and landings from the airport near Washington were halted as helicopters from law enforcement agencies across the region flew over the scene in search of survivors. Inflatable rescue boats were launched into the Potomac River from a point near the airport along the George Washington Parkway, just north of the airport. President Donald Trump was briefed, his press secretary said, and Vice President JD Vance encouraged followers on the social media platform X to ""say a prayer for everyone involved."" The Federal Aviation Administration said the midair crash occurred around 9 p.m. EST when a regional jet that had departed from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a military Blackhawk helicopter while on approach to an airport runway. It occurred in some of the most tightly controlled and monitored airspace in the world, just over three miles south of the White House and the Capitol. Investigators will try to piece together the aircrafts' final moments before their collision, including contact with air traffic controllers as well as a loss of altitude by the passenger jet. American Airlines flight 5342 was inbound to Reagan National at an altitude of about 400 feet and a speed of about 140 miles per hour when it suffered a rapid loss of altitude over the Potomac River, according to data from its radio transponder. The Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-701 twin-engine jet was manufactured in 2004 and can be configured to carry up to 70 passengers. A few minutes before landing, air traffic controllers asked the arriving commercial jet if it could land on the shorter Runway 33 at Reagan National and the pilots said they were able. Controllers then cleared the plane to land on Runway 33. Flight tracking sites showed the plane adjust its approach to the new runway. In audio from the air traffic control tower around the time of the crash, a controller is heard asking the helicopter, ""PAT25 do you have the CRJ in sight,"" in reference to the passenger aircraft. ""Tower did you see that?"" another pilot is heard calling seconds after the apparent collision. The tower immediately began diverting other aircraft from Reagan. Video from an observation camera at the nearby Kennedy Center showed two sets of lights consistent with aircraft appearing to join in a fireball. In a post on social media, American Airlines said it was aware of reports that one of its flights was involved in the incident and said it would provide more information once available. The crash is serving as a major test for two of the Trump administration's newest agency leaders. Pete Hegseth, sworn in days ago as defense secretary, posted on social media that his department was ""actively monitoring"" the situation that involved an Army helicopter. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, just sworn in earlier this week, said in a social media post that he was ""at the FAA HQ and closely monitoring the situation."" Reagan National is located along the Potomac River, just southwest of the city. It's a popular choice because it's much closer than the larger Dulles International Airport, which is deeper in Virginia. Depending on the runway being used, flights into Reagan can offer passengers spectacular views of landmarks like the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the National Mall and the U.S. Capitol. It's a postcard-worthy welcome for tourists visiting the city. The incident recalled the crash of an Air Florida flight that plummeted into the Potomac on January 13, 1982, that killed 78 people. That crash was attributed to bad weather. The last fatal crash involving a U.S. commercial airline occured in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane was killed, including 45 passengers, 2 pilots and 2 flight attendants. Another person on the ground also died, bringing the total death toll to 50. An investigation determined that the captain accidentally caused the plane to stall as it approached the airport in Buffalo.","the, jet, runway, potomac, passenger, airport, crash, reagan, flight, tower, helicopter, bombardier, crj, collision, air, washington, duffy, dulles, controllers, capitol"

All 176 people on board are evacuated,Associated Press,2025-01-29 11:33:33,"SEOUL, JANUARY 29 A passenger plane caught fire before takeoff at an airport in South Korea late Tuesday, but all 176 people on board were safely evacuated, authorities said. The Airbus plane operated by South Korean airline Air Busan was preparing to leave for Hong Kong when its rear parts caught fire at Gimhae International Airport in the southeast, the Transport Ministry said in a statement. The plane's 169 passengers, six crewmembers and one engineer were evacuated using an escape slide, the ministry said. The National Fire Agency said in a release that three people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation. The fire agency said the fire was completely put out at 11:31 p.m., about one hour after it deployed firefighters and fire trucks at the scene. The cause of the fire wasn't immediately known. The Transport Ministry said the plane is an A321 model. Tuesday's incident came a month after a Jeju Air passenger plane crashed at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. It was one of the deadliest disasters in South Korea's aviation history. The Boeing 737-800 skidded off the airport's runaway on Dec. 29 after its landing gear failed to deploy, slamming into a concrete structure and bursting into flames. The flight was returning from Bangkok and all of the victims were South Koreans except for two Thai nationals. The first report on the crash released Monday said authorities have confirmed traces of bird strikes in the plane's engines, though officials haven't determined the cause of the accident.","plane, south, airport, passenger, korea, the, fire, busan, jeju, air, 176, ministry, agency, korean, cause, crewmembers, airbus, gimhae, a321, transport"

Special Envoy held discussions with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Bishnu Prasad Paudel, Minister of Labour, Employment, and Social Security Sharat Singh Bhandari, and Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Amrit Bahadur Rai to discuss ways to enhance bilateral cooperation, today. During the meetings, both sides acknowledged the importance of sustained high-level exchanges on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Nepal and Korea. Significant recent exchanges included a foreign ministerial meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly last year and the visit of Nepal's Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies Damodar Bhandari to Korea last month. They agreed to continue such exchanges in the future, according to the press release issued by the embassy. A shared commitment to strengthening economic, development, employment, and tourism cooperation was highlighted. Both sides pledged to leverage the Korea-Nepal Trade and Investment Promotion Framework (TIPF) signed last December to boost trade, investment, and industrial collaboration while supporting the operations of Korean companies in Nepal, the release further stated. Discussions also focused on enhancing employment cooperation through the Employment Permit System (EPS) and strengthening development cooperation and people-to-people exchanges. ""Since establishing diplomatic ties in 1974, Korea and Nepal have cultivated a strong and friendly partnership in various fields, including development, economy, employment, and tourism, underpinned by close human exchanges over the past 50 years."" Korea has designated Nepal as a priority partner for Official Development Assistance (ODA) for 15 consecutive years, focusing on agriculture, health, vocational training, and climate change. Major Korean companies like Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor have significantly contributed to Nepal's manufacturing industry by setting up assembly plants, while Korea has also made substantial investments in the energy sector, including the Upper Trishuli-1 Hydroelectric Project, the release added. Since the signing of the Korea-Nepal EPS MOU in 2007, over 110,000 Nepali workers have found employment in Korea, contributing to economic growth in both countries. The Korean government also supports reintegration programs for returnee migrant workers to promote entrepreneurship and resettlement in Nepal. This visit by Korea's Special Envoy underscores the Korean government's strong commitment to reflecting on the past 50 years of friendly cooperation with Nepal and further solidifying its partnership with Nepal as a key partner country for the next 50 years of mutual growth and collaboration, the embassy said. The delegation led by Lee Jeongkyu will also visit Korean business operations and development cooperation project sites during their stay.","korean, envoy, cooperation, exchanges, the, employment, korea, jeongkyu, special, bhandari, development, assembly, lee, project, partner, sharat, reintegration, oda, samsung, eps"

Inaugurating the 3rd annual conference on 'Climate Change and Sustainability of Trade in South Asia' organized jointly by the World Trade Organization and the Kathmandu University in the federal capital on Saturday, DPM Paudel reminded that Nepal is on the forefront of climate change vulnerability, resulting into adverse impacts on socio-economy and infrastructures. Decentralization of production centres and diversification of supply chain could help reduce risk in trade infrastructures, according to him. The DPM hoped the conference would be fruitful to whet the pressing issues of climate change in south Asia and build common perspectives among policy makers, researchers and private sector representatives so that they would take proper strategies for future. Efforts made by Nepal despite its negligible role in climate change need to be made visible. The climate actions like mitigation and adaptation should be prioritized, he suggested. Similarly, the Finance Minister pointed out the need for developing climate resilient infrastructures so that supply chain will not be disrupted. On the occasion, Registrar at the Kathmandu University, Dr Achyut Wagle, said the initiatives for sustainable economic development should be friendly to private sector. Just and balanced efforts in south Asia can promote trade, he said, adding that continuous actions are required to reduce impact of climate change. In view of Joint Secretary at Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supply, Devraj Joshi, Nepal could forward sustainable trade by addressing the problems facing trade and climate change. Study and research in this sector would enrich policy and action plans, he believed. Representatives from nine countries including Nepal, India, Bangladesh, China, Turkey, and Indonesia attended the event.","climate, change, trade, dpm, paudel, infrastructures, asia, sustainability, the, bishnu, sector, supply, actions, makers, south, forefront, conference, achyut, representatives, wagle"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/nhrc-calls-upon-igp-kunwar-into-alleged-abuse-lamichhanes-human-rights,NHRC calls upon IGP Kunwar into alleged abuse of Lamichhane's human rights,Bal Krishna Sah,2024-12-10 08:24:07,"KATHMANDU, DECEMBER 9 Amid growing concerns about human rights violations of the former home minister and deputy prime minister Rabi Lamichhane in custody, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Basanta Bahadur Kunwar failed to appear before the National Human Rights Commission for an investigation. NHRC spokesperson Tikaram Pokharel told THT, ""Lamichhane has accused IG of instructing police to take him to Pokhara at midnight."" Complaint has been filed to NHRC stating that Lamichhane was subjected to inhuman treatment and violation of human rights while being taken to Kaski from Chitwan. Lamichhane is under investigation for his alleged involvement in organised crime, money laundering, and cooperative fund misappropriation and an arrest warrant has been issued for Lamichhane in Chitwan, Kathmandu, Rupandehi, and Parsa for investigating cooperative fraud, and his statement has been recorded in locations other than Parsa. Lamichhane was taken to Parsa by police today. Lamichhane, who was arrested on October 18 in Kathmandu, was first taken to Kaski for a probe. On Monday, he was flown from Pokhara to Kathmandu, then to Simara, and then driven to Birgunj, where the investigation into the case will continue. Lamichhane was returned from Chitwan by the Pokhara chief at midnight. Rabi Lamichhane complained about the mistreatment he received from the police during his transfer to Pokhara, claiming denial of medical care and being forcibly moved while ill. Lamichhane presented documents in court indicating that he went to the hospital immediately after arriving in Pokhara due to high blood pressure. He claimed that he was unfairly targeted in retaliation, causing stress for his family as well. He claimed that the investigation yielded no new information and accused authorities of putting him through unnecessary hardship by forcing him to travel across the country. However, the Chitwan District Police have denied that Lamichhane was mistreated. According to an NHRC spokesperson, the commission is continuing to investigate whether Lamichhane was mistreated while being transported from Chitwan to Pokhara. NHRC spokesperson Pokharel told THT that Kunwar was not present on Monday despite being summoned to make a statement alleging human rights violations against Lamichhane while in custody. Kunwar had sent AIG Tek Prasad Tamang of the Criminal Investigation Department, DIG Dan Bahadur Karki of the Secretariat, and SP Mohan Kumar Thapa of the police's human rights wing to the commission's office rather than himself. ""They presented arguments in their defence. They claimed that they did so for various reasons. However, we have concluded that further discussions are required at a higher level. He is currently outside of Kathmandu. We will go over this in greater detail. We have not come to any conclusion yet,"" he said. The NHRC has asked police to conduct an impartial and independent investigation while respecting and protecting detainees' right to a fair trial and basic human rights, as well as the rule of law. Lamichhane has been detained for 53 days as part of an investigation, and now that his remand was extended by four days by Kaski District Court on Sunday, he will likely spend two months in custody. Earlier, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) filed a complaint with the NHRC, expressing concern about Lamichhane's human rights violations. In a letter submitted to the NHRC on Friday, the RSP accused the current government of taking action against Lamichhane out of 'political vendetta.' The letter has drawn the Commission's attention to the government's violations of human rights, including making secret documents public through ""media trials,"" transferring people in ""inhumane ways,"" and ""seizing"" private property. The RSP has made a four-point request to 'protect Lamichhane's life and human rights,' conducting an investigation into Lamichhane's human rights violations. It has also demanded action against those responsible. Lamichhane is also being investigated for money laundering, and officials say he could be detained for up to 90 days for questioning and investigation. However, according to legal experts, there is now a 13-day filing deadline in this case. The investigation has a total duration of 90 days; 77 days have already passed.","nhrc, rights, investigation, lamichhane, commission, human, the, kunwar, violations, tikaram, bahadur, igp, days, police, basanta, pokharel, spokesperson, complaint, dan, inspector"

Talking about the program, ODYLP is a 3 week US based exchange program designed to empower young leaders to make a better change in their community. This program was administered by Legacy International and fully funded by the U.S Department of State. The core areas of the program were Civic Engagement, STEM skills and knowledge, Cultural Exchange and Community Projects. On June 14,2024, me along with 15 other young leaders and 2 dedicated mentors, headed towards our journey to the United States of America as a youth participant from Nepal. From the moment we landed in the USA, there was a sense of excitement within us as it was the first time for many of us in the USA, and the warm greetings we received in our arrival was truly an unforgettable memory. Our day during the program was filled with various activities and workshops related to STEM and leadership. In the USA, the program was held in the capital of the country; Washington D.C. and Kansas City. We started our program with Scavenger Hunt in the Steven F. Udvar Hazy Air and Space National Museum. Exploring and getting to know about the inspiring stories of Women in STEM was really motivating for me. Following the program, we also attended a workshop on Sustainable development goals in the Smithsonian Science and Education Center. A particularly memorable experience was when we visited the White House. As we stood together for a group photo, a passerby asked us where we were from. When we replied, ""Nepal"", he graciously played our country's National Anthem. It was a very proud moment for us as it highlighted the global connections we were making in the United States and the pride we felt in representing our country Nepal in an international platform. Throughout the program, we participated in various workshops and activities focused on STEM skills and leadership development.Whether it was leadership workshops or designing projects, each activity we did in various organizations and places was an opportunity for us to grow and learn. Our time in the United States of America also included cultural exchange, where we shared Nepali traditions and explored American Culture. A major highlight was our cultural night with our host families and Legacy International as well as Global Ties Kansas City team, where we presented traditional Nepali music, dances and Attire. It was a joy to see our rich heritage being celebrated and appreciated by everyone. We also got the opportunity to volunteer in the local food bank in the Kansas City while our stay there. For me, the ODYLP program wasn't just about academic and cultural exploration, it was also about personal growth. ODYLP provided us with all the required tools and opportunities such as team building activities and leadership skills to make a meaningful and positive impact in our community. As I now reflect on this incredible journey, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunity to be part of such transformative experience. As someone passionate about STEM and leadership, ODYLP has truly been an inspiring as well as transformative experience for me!

In a remarkable feat of determination and speed, they managed to establish both Camp 3 and Camp 4 within a short period, culminating in today's summit achievement. Mount K2, also known as Mount Godwin Austen, stands at 8,611 meters and is renowned for its treacherous conditions and challenging terrain.

This year marks 50 years of GIZ's presence in Nepal as well as 61 years since KfW's establishment. GIZ, as part of German Development Cooperation, has been providing impactful technical cooperation in the country. Simultaneously, KfW provides financial cooperation in various sectors in Nepal, according to a press release issued by the German Embassy. Vice President of Nepal Ramsahay Prasad Yadav, was invited as the chief guest for the event. Among the guests were officials from various ministries of the Government of Nepal, leaders of political parties, heads of Kathmandu-based diplomatic missions, civil society members, Human Rights advocates, businesspersons, media persons and people from various walks of life. In his welcome speech, Ambassador Prinz said, ""Today, while we celebrate 34 years of German unity, we also celebrate 66 years of bilateral relations between Nepal and Germany. We have been standing with Nepal in difficult times, be it the civil war, the 2015 earthquake, Covid-19 pandemic as well as the recent catastrophic floods. We welcome the huge progress Nepal has made and continue our support."" Ambassador Prinz also held a minute of silence for those who lost their lives in the floods and landslides caused by torrential rain last week. He further noted that Germany has pledged to donate up to EUR 100,000 for the recent flood victims. Ambassador Prinz also referenced the recent visit of Nepal's President Ram Chandra Paudel to Germany, underscoring the continued strengthening of bilateral relations. 35 years ago, in 1989, the ""Berlin Wall"" came down – the wall which had been dividing the Eastern and Western part of Germany since 1963. The ""Berliner Mauer"" was designed to physically prevent disaffected East Germans from fleeing to the West. The Peaceful Revolution of 1989 led to the opening of the border on November 9, 1989, which for the first time after 28 years allowed Germans to freely move in the whole of the country. It led to a new form of encounters between the East and the West, which eventually re-united the whole of Europe.","german, prinz, the, unity, wall, cooperation, ramsahay, 1989, years, germans, revolution, east, peaceful, kfw, anuza, berliner, mauer, chandra, ram, yadav"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/world-leaders-are-gathering-in-new-york-for-the-un-general-assembly-the-outlook-is-gloomy,World leaders are gathering in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. The outlook is gloomy,Associated Press,2024-09-22 21:28:53,"UNITED NATIONS, SEPTEMBER 22 Facing a swirl of conflicts and crises across a fragmented world, leaders attending this week's annual U.N. gathering are being challenged: Work together - not only on front-burner issues but on modernizing the international institutions born after World War II so they can tackle the threats and problems of the future. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued the challenge a year ago after sounding a global alarm about the survival of humanity and the planet: Come to a ""Summit of the Future"" and make a new commitment to multilateralism – the foundation of the United Nations and many other global bodies – and start fixing the aging global architecture to meet the rapidly changing world. The U.N. chief told reporters last week that the summit ""was born out of a cold, hard fact: international challenges are moving faster than our ability to solve them."" He pointed to ""out-of-control geopolitical divisions"" and ""runaway"" conflicts, climate change, inequalities, debt and new technologies like artificial intelligence which have no guardrails. The two-day summit started Sunday, two days before the high-level meeting of world leaders begins at the sprawling U.N. compound in New York City. The General Assembly approved the summit's main outcome document - a 42-page ""Pact of the Future"" - on Sunday morning with a bang of the gavel by Assembly President Philémon Yang signifying consensus, after the body voted 143-7 with 15 abstentions against considering Russian-proposed amendments to significantly water it down. The pact is a blueprint to address global challenges from conflicts and climate change to artificial intelligence and reforming the U.N. and global institutions. Its impact will depend on its implementation by the assembly's 193 member nations. ""Leaders must ask themselves whether this will be yet another meeting where they simply talk about greater cooperation and consensus, or whether they will show the imagination and conviction to actually forge it,"" said Agnès Callamard, the secretary-general of Amnesty International. ""If they miss this opportunity, I shudder to think of the consequences. Our collective future is at stake."" This is the UN's biggest week of the year The summit is the prelude to this year's high-level meeting, held every September. More than 130 presidents, prime ministers and monarchs are slated to speak along with dozens of ministers, and the issues from the summit are expected to dominate their speeches and private meetings, especially the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan and the growing possibility of a wider Mideast war. ""There is going to be a rather obvious gap between the Summit of the Future, with its focus on expanding international cooperation, and the reality that the U.N. is failing in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan,"" said Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group. ""Those three wars will be top topics of attention for most of the week."" One notable moment at Tuesday's opening assembly meeting: U.S. President Joe Biden's likely final major appearance on the world stage, a platform he has tread upon and reveled in for decades. At the upcoming meetings, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters this week: ""The most vulnerable around the world are counting on us to make progress, to make change, to bring about a sense of hope for them."" To meet the many global challenges, she said, the U.S. focus at the U.N. meetings will be on ending ""the scourge of war."" Roughly 2 billion people live in conflict-affected areas, she said. Last September, the war in Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, took center stage at the U.N. global gathering. But as the first anniversary of Hamas' deadly attack in southern Israel approaches on Oct. 7, the spotlight is certain to be on the war in Gaza and escalating violence across the Israeli-Lebanon border, which is now threatening to spread to the wider Middle East. Iran supports both Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon's Hezbollah militants. Its new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, will address world leaders on Tuesday afternoon. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is scheduled to speak Thursday morning and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday afternoon. Zelenskyy will get the spotlight twice. He will speak Tuesday at a high-level meeting of the U.N. Security Council - called by the United States, France, Japan, Malta, South Korea and Britain - and will address the General Assembly on Wednesday morning. They're trying to counter 'a world of grim statistics' Slovenia, which holds the council's rotating presidency this month, chose the topic ""Leadership for Peace"" for its high-level meeting Wednesday, challenging its 15 member nations to address why the U.N. body charged with maintaining international peace and security is failing - and how it can do better. ""The event follows our observation that we live in a world of grim statistics, with the highest number of ongoing conflicts, with record high casualties among civilians, among humanitarians, among medical workers, among journalist,"" Slovenian U.N. Ambassador Samuel Zbogar told reporters. He cited a record-high 100 million people driven from their homes by conflict. ""The world is becoming less stable, less peaceful, and with erosion of the respect for the rules, it is sliding into the state of disorder,"" Zbogar said. ""We have not seen this high need to rebuild trust to secure the future ever before."" A key reason for the Security Council's dysfunction is the deep division among its five veto-wielding permanent members. The United States, Israel's closest ally, is a supporter of Ukraine alongside Britain and France. Russia invaded Ukraine and has a military and economic partnership with China, though Beijing reasserted its longstanding support for every country's sovereignty without criticizing Russia in a recent briefing paper for the U.N. meetings. French President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's new prime minister, Keir Starmer, will be at the United Nations this week along with Biden. But Russian President Vladimir Putin and China's President Xi Jinping are sending their foreign ministers instead. Neither Putin nor Xi attended last year, either. Guterres, who will preside over the whole affair this week, warned that the world is seeing ""a multiplication of conflicts and the sense of impunity"" - a landscape where, he said, ""any country or any military entity, militias, whatever, feel that they can do whatever they want because nothing will happen to them."" ""And the fact that nobody takes even seriously the capacity of the powers to solve problems on the ground,"" he said, ""makes the level of impunity (on) an enormous level.""","the, summit, assembly, pact, president, nations, world, council, level, future, global, meeting, united, high, zbogar, philémon, general, its, greenfield, international"

The training sessions, which took place in Chaurjahari, Rukum West (September 11–12), Birendranagar, Surkhet (September 13–14), and Khalanga, Jumla (September 15–16), aimed to enhance the skills of local journalists in reporting with utmost sensitivity. The workshops attracted participants from Surkhet, Dailekh, Rukum West, Jajarkot, Dolpa, Salyan, Jumla, Mugu, and Kalikot districts, including 25 female journalists. The sessions focused on practical techniques for reporting on sensitive topics such as conflict, diversity, and disinformation, equipping participants with tools to navigate complex issues while maintaining ethical standards and promoting peace. The interactive format allowed the participants to engage in group discussions and presentations, with each cohort divided into groups of three to five members. These groups tackled key questions like: Why do journalists need sensitivity when reporting on diversity? How should they counter hate speech and disinformation? Under what conditions is it essential to protect sources of information? What are the ethical considerations in sharing photographs? Why is fact-checking crucial for journalists? Through these discussions, the journalists gained practical insights and developed a deeper understanding of their role in fostering social harmony and preventing conflict. One of the major outcomes of the training was the formulation of a Conflict-Sensitive Journalism (CSJ) Code of Conduct, the first of its kind in Nepal. This code emphasizes the responsibilities of journalists in reporting on conflict, ensuring their work contributes to peace-building efforts and does not incite violence or discrimination. Some of the key provisions of the code of conduct include: Protect the privacy and rights of children when reporting. Avoid using language or terms that could incite conflict in news coverage. Be sensitive when covering incidents of caste based discrimination and maintain fairness. Do not discriminate based on political opinions or affiliations in reporting. Refrain from publishing or broadcasting content that harms religious or social harmony. Ensure sensitivity when using photographs, respecting privacy in both print and online media. Pay special attention to marginalized and minority communities, including people living with disability, senior citizens, and sexual and gender minorities. Maintain the confidentiality of news sources to protect their identities, especially in sensitive stories. Verify all information before publication or broadcast to prevent misinformation. Avoid exaggerating issues related to the food security of Karnali's citizens to prevent panic. This code is set to serve as a guideline for grassroots journalists across Nepal, helping them navigate the delicate balance between reporting facts and fostering peace in conflict-sensitive regions. ""This initiative reflects the growing importance of responsible journalism in preventing conflicts and ensuring that media plays a constructive role in Nepal's ongoing peace-building efforts, "" Said Laxman Datt Pant, Chairperson of Media Action Nepal. The training workshops were led by Pant, a globally acknowledged media trainer and advocate for freedom of expression. Pant was joined by Kamal Dev Bhattarai, Editor of Annapurna Express English Daily, and Lalit Budha, Karnali Province Coordinator for Media Action Nepal, who facilitated the interactive sessions. Their combined expertise and practical insights enriched the learning experience for the participants. These training sessions were organized under the project ""Strengthening the role of youth, CSOs, and media,"" supported by GiZ-Civil Peace Service, which aims to bolster media's role in promoting peace and stability in Nepal.","code, journalists, training, sessions, workshops, the, september, media, journalism, karnali, conflict, csj, sensitive, grassroots, peace, harmony, conduct, role, considerations, datt"

Djokovic was drawn Thursday against Australian Matthew Ebden in the first round, and Nadal faces Hungarian Marton Fucsovics, with the winners of those matches meeting next. The Summer Games' tennis competition begins Saturday at Roland Garros, and Djokovic's opening singles match is that day. Nadal is scheduled to play doubles alongside Carlos Alcaraz on Saturday night, but he won't get started in singles until Sunday. The 38-year-old Nadal won a record 14 of his 22 major trophies at the French Open. He has won two Olympic gold medals - in singles at Beijing in 2008, and in doubles with Marc López at Rio de Janeiro in 2016. ""Roland Garros, as everybody knows, is the most special place in tennis for me. I am enjoying the fact I am back for the Olympics,"" Nadal said Thursday. ""I am just trying to enjoy every single moment."" He has played sparingly over the past two seasons while dealing with hip surgery and abdominal muscle issues. It's possible he will retire after the Olympics, although Nadal has not said exactly what his plans are. French Open champion Alcaraz takes on Lebanese player Hady Habib in the first round of singles on Saturday, before teaming up with Nadal later on Day 1. Djokovic, a 24-time major champion from Serbia, and Alcaraz could meet for the singles gold in Paris, which would be a rematch of their contest in the Wimbledon final this month. Alcaraz won that one for his fourth Grand Slam title. Top-ranked Iga Swiatek of Poland faces Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania in the first round of the women's draw, with second-seeded American Coco Gauff taking on Australian Ajla Tomljanović, who defeated Serena Williams at the 2022 U.S. Open in the 23-time Slam champ's final match. Gauff is the reigning U.S. Open champion and is making her Olympic debut. She is a flag bearer for the U.S. team at Friday's opening ceremony along with basketball star LeBron James. She will be the first tennis athlete to carry the U.S. flag. Djokovic and Swiatek have not won Olympic gold. Djokovic's only Olympic medal was a bronze at Beijing 16 years ago. Swiatek has won the French Open four of the past five years on the same clay courts at Roland Garros. Four-time major winner Naomi Osaka of Japan takes on three-time major champion Angelique Kerber of Germany. Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini of Italy, who is seeded fourth, returns to the courts where she lost the French Open final to Swiatek and takes on Romanian Ana Bogdan. No. 5-seeded American Jessica Pegula plays Viktorija Golubic of Switzerland. Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic - seeded ninth - is drawn against Spaniard Sara Sorribes Tormo. The 2022 Wimbledon champ Elena Rybakina - seeded third - plays Romanian Jaqueline Cristian. No. 10 Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia, who won the French Open here in 2017 for her only major, faces Colombian Camila Osorio. Men's and women's first-round play begins Saturday, and the top-ranked man won't be playing. Jannik Sinner, a 22-year-old from Italy, pulled out on Wednesday because of tonsillitis. Eighth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 2021 French Open runner-up to Djokovic, takes on Belgian Zizou Bergs, and three-time major winner Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland is up against Pavel Kotov. Wimbledon semifinalist Lorenzo Musetti of Italy, seeded 11th, plays French veteran Gael Monfils. Two-time French Open runner-up Casper Ruud of Norway, the No. 6 seed, takes on Taro Daniel of Japan. Also, it's No. 4 Daniil Medvedev of Russia vs. Rinky Hijikata of Australia, and No. 7-seeded American Taylor Fritz vs. big-serving Kazakh Alexander Bublik. Tokyo Games champion Alexander Zverev of Germany plays Jaume Munar of Spain. Two-time Olympic champion Andy Murray has withdrawn from singles but will play in men's doubles alongside Dan Evans in his adieu from tennis. They face Japanese pair Japan's Daniel and Kei Nishikori. The 37-year-old Murray, a three-time Slam champion, won gold in singles at London in 2012 and Rio four years later. Since having hip replacement surgery in 2019, he has struggled with various injuries and withdrew from singles at Wimbledon because he needed a procedure to remove a cyst from his spine. ""The Olympics has been incredibly special to me. I'm really happy I get to do this one more time,"" Murray said Thursday. ""I just ran out of time really (to play singles), but happy to be in the doubles with Dan and we play well together."" In women's doubles, top-seeded American pair Gauff and Pegula drew Australian pair Daria Saville and Ellen Perez. In men's doubles, Nadal and Alcaraz will open against sixth-seeded Argentines Maximo Gonzalez and Andres Molteni. Tsitsipas teams up with younger brother Petros to face Portuguese pair Nuno Borges and Francisco Cabral.","olympic, seeded, champion, open, wimbledon, the, tsitsipas, tennis, french, doubles, slam, murray, alexander, nadal, gauff, olympics, time, djokovic, monfils, gael"

In his address, he congratulated the Olympians on their achievements, emphasizing the significance of their selection to represent Nepal on the world stage. He noted that this proud moment extends beyond the athletes to their friends, families, and the entire nation. ""Success in sports is never due to one person but is the product of dedication from your coaches and the supporting team who are present here this evening,"" he said. Meanwhile, the President of Nepal Olympic Committee Jeevan Ram Shrestha said, ""We are confident that it (Paris Olympic Games) will be a magnificent event, demonstrating excellence and unity"". During their stay in Paris, the athletes will reside in the Olympic Village, providing them the opportunity to meet fellow sportspersons who share their passion and values.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/para-taekwondo-athletes-dreams-for-paris-2024-paralympic-games,Para-Taekwondo Athletes' dreams for Paris 2024 Paralympic Games,Skanda Gautam,2024-07-07 15:27:04,"KATHMANDU: Bharatsingh Mahata, a farmer's son from the remote Darchula district, journeyed to Kathmandu with his wife and children to chase his dream of playing para taekwondo. The journey took four long days. Now, they live in a rented makeshift home in Kirtipur. Despite having only one hand, Bharat works tirelessly at a cow farm made with a loan he still hasn't been able to repay. His mother even sold her jewelry, and he hasn't been able to pay her back either. ""The day I win the Paralympics,"" he says, ""I will build a house or at least rent a proper home for my family."" His only survival is selling milk for money to make a living for his family and educating his children. Every morning, he wakes up at 4 AM, milks the cows, and sells the milk. By 6:30 AM, he is at the training ground, driven by his dream of bringing a medal home for his country. When Bharatsingh was in school, a teacher embarrassed him in front of the whole class because of his hand. The entire class laughed, and that day he felt deeply humiliated. ""One day, ""I will do something great for myself."" Leaving his education behind his tears turned into determination, pushing him to pursue Taekwondo. Now at the age of 27, Bharatsingh has been training with the national team for 15 months. He has competed in the Asian selection for the Paris Paralympics in Taiwan, China, and Vietnam. His passion caught the attention of coach Kabiraj, who offered to train him for free. In just a year and a half, Bharat won international matches and secured a Wild Card quota for the Paris Paralympics, though a medal still awaits him. Bharat is grateful to the Nepal Taekwondo Association for providing him with lodging and food, and to the National Sports Council for their support. ""They have looked after me and done so much good."" Palesha Goverdhan, another Para-Taekwondo player, has qualified for the 2024 Paris Paralympics after winning a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China. She is the first Nepali para-athlete to achieve this milestone. Palesha, also without a left palm, has been a shining star. At the age of 20, she has won numerous medals, defeating players worldwide since she started her journey at 13. She trains with relentless energy and dreams of bringing home a Paralympic medal. Palesha studies architecture in China and has taken a six-month leave to focus on her training. She recalls her school days when she trained at Satdobato Sports Complex from 5 AM to 7:30 AM before heading to school. From a young age, she was very committed to taekwondo. Her parents have always supported her. She loves reading, drawing, and writing. Palesha recalls, ""I was always interested in martial arts, and when the opportunity came in school, I took it. At that time, I didn't even feel different from other students. Only when the coach introduced me as differently-abled did I realize I was different."" She adds, ""Football and basketball are easy to understand, so they have many audiences. Though Taekwondo doesn't have a lot of audience, I feel if I do my best, I will be appreciated. Many of my peers fear financial instability. If the government were more willing to help players financially, we would have better results and recognition worldwide."" The environment for being a full-time athlete in Nepal is still not ideal for many reasons, possibly political or due to a lack of funds. Therefore, there always has to be a plan B in my life. That's why I am studying to be an architect-engineer. ""When you play and perform well all year, but don't do well in just one tournament, sometimes that happens and there's no guarantee that when I am back I'll make the National team again. It's very hard,"" says Palesha Goverdhan. Coach Kabiraj Negi Lama has been training the Nepali para taekwondo team since 2015, leading them to win 10 international medals. Despite not winning a medal in the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics, the team's determination remains unshaken. With the blessings of the Nepali people, they aim to turn dreams into reality in Paris. The Nepal Taekwondo Association introduced Para Taekwondo in 2013. Since then, Nepal has won 21 international medals but none in the Olympics. Coach Kabiraj feels immense pride in Palesha's achievements and Bharatsingh's commitment. Despite limited resources, Palesha has defeated well-equipped international players. Her determination shows a strong and unbreakable spirit, inspiring everyone around the world. ""My sweet journey in life began the day I left my village and came here, determined to forget everything in my past and leave all negativity behind and only look ahead,"" says Bharat.","taekwondo, para, paralympics, kabiraj, the, medal, am, paralympic, his, medals, her, coach, paris, my, palesha, bharatsingh, negi, age, tokyo, darchula"

The Embassy featured a photo exhibition titled ""The Fight for Everest 1924,"" which was initially displayed at the Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (KIMFF) last week alongside the documentary ""Everest Revisited."" The collection is set to be permanently displayed at the International Mountain Museum (IMM) in Pokhara. Speaking at the event, Rob Fenn, UK Ambassador to Nepal, commented that, although the 1924 expedition had not come to Kathmandu, Nepalis played an important role in it and ""have continued be to be pivotal in Everest attempts since."" He added that ""Britons are besotted with raw courage"". ""It's what has been drawing us to Nepal and to Nepalis for more than two hundred years"". Ambassador Fenn shared news announced in the UK in December, that Nepalis are now eligible to apply for expedition funding from the UK-based Mount Everest Foundation (www.mef.org.uk/news/mef-opens-grants-to-nepali-applicants). Since its inception in 1955, the MEF has provided funds to over 2,000 expeditions in remote locations and to scientists researching high-altitude medicine, glaciology and climate change. John Porter, Director and Producer of ""Everest Revisited"" and MEF's Honorary Secretary said ""It is an honour to represent the Chair of the Mount Everest Foundation, Rebecca Stephens, the first British woman to climb Everest, at this reciprocation of the event hosted by His Excellency Gyan Chandra Acharya at the Embassy of Nepal in London on the International Day of the Mountains last December"". Porter was also representing the Alpine Club, as associate curator of the exhibition. ""Alpine Club member, Ian Wall, created this superb exhibition with the financial support of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. I am looking forward to seeing it reach its permanent home in Pokhara on 8 June. One hundred years on from the 1924 Exhibition, The Royal Geographical Society and Alpine Club are delighted they have been able to work together on this exhibition as they did on the expeditions in the 1920s"".

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/partial-remains-of-british-climber-believed-found-100-years-after-everest-ascent,Partial remains of British climber believed found 100 years after Everest ascent,Associated Press,2024-10-11 21:39:40,"LONDON, OCTOBER 11 Climbers believe they have found the partial remains of a British mountaineer who might - or might not - have been one of the first two people to climb Mount Everest, a century after their attempt on the world's highest peak, according to an expedition led by National Geographic. Ahead of the release of a documentary film, the television channel said Friday that the expedition found a foot encased in a sock embroidered with ""AC Irvine"" and a boot that could be that of Andrew ""Sandy"" Irvine, who disappeared at the age of 22 along with his co-climber, the legendary George Mallory, near Everest's peak on June 8, 1924. The pair, who were seeking to become the first people to conquer Everest, were last seen around 800 feet (245 meters) from the summit. Their fate has been debated by climbers and historians alike, with some postulating that they had stood atop of the world before disappearing on the way down. In his final letter to his wife, Ruth, before he vanished on Mount Everest a century ago, the 37-year-old Mallory, who once famously said he wanted to conquer Everest ""because it's there,"" tried to ease her worries even as he said his chances of reaching the world's highest peak were ""50 to 1 against us."" Mallory's body was found in 1999 but there was no evidence that could point to the two having reached Everest's summit at 29,032 feet (8,849 meters). There is still no such evidence, though the apparent discovery of Irvine's remains could narrow the search for a Kodak Vest Pocket camera lent to the climbers by expedition member Howard Somervell. For mountaineers, it's the equivalent of the Holy Grail - the possibility of photographic proof that the two did reach the summit, almost three decades before New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing Norgay got there on May, 29, 1953. The sock and boot were found at a lower altitude than Mallory's remains, on the Central Rongbuk Glacier below the North Face of Mount Everest. ""This was a monumental and emotional moment for us and our entire team on the ground, and we just hope this can finally bring peace of mind to his relatives and the climbing world at large,"" said climb team member and National Geographic explorer Jimmy Chin. Chin did not say exactly where the remains were found because he wants to discourage trophy hunters. But he's confident that other items - and maybe even the camera - are nearby. ""It certainly reduces the search area,"" he told National Geographic. The Irvine family has volunteered to compare DNA test results with the remains to confirm his identity. His great-niece and biographer, Julie Summers, said she reacted emotionally when she found out about the discovery. ""I have lived with this story since I was a 7-year-old when my father told us about the mystery of Uncle Sandy on Everest,"" she said. ""When Jimmy told me that he saw the name AC Irvine on the label on the sock inside the boot, I found myself moved to tears. It was and will remain an extraordinary and poignant moment."" The find, made by Chin along with climbers and filmmakers Erich Roepke and Mark Fisher, was reported to the London-based Royal Geographical Society, which jointly organized Mallory and Irvine's expedition along with the Alpine Club. ""As joint organizer of the 1924 Everest expedition, the society deeply appreciates the respect Jimmy Chin's team has shown Sandy Irvine's remains and their sensitivity toward Sandy's family members and others connected to that expedition,"" said Joe Smith, director of the society.

OCTOBER 6 The North Face Everest Ski Project architected by top American climbers has ended citing a bad weather condition as well as time constraint after the team reached above Camp III via Hornbein Couloir route in Tibet. According to sources at the base camp, a team of rope fixing Sherpa climbers has been returning to the base camp wrapping up their plan to fix a route above Camp III. ""Time is running out and the snow condition along the route was very fragile,"" sources told THT confirming that the team has given up from the high camp as it faced adverse weather condition along the Hornbein Couloir route. The Couloir was named after a member of the 1963 US Everest Expedition, Thomas Hornbein. Last year too, the team couldn't made it to above the Camp II citing the same reasons. Being part of the multi-million dollar Everest Ski Project, renowned American ski mountaineer Jim Morrison along with academy award-winning film director Jimmy Chin and cinematographer Mark Fisher attempted to make a ski descent from the top of Mt Everest. It's a project reportedly designed by Jim Morrison in memory of his partner Hilaree Nelson. Extreme American ski mountaineer Hilaree had been found dead after attempting to ski down from the summit of Mt Manaslu in 2022. North Face athlete Hilaree and partner Jim had made the first ski descent of Lhotse, the fourth tallest mountain in the world, in 2021. A team of Sherpa climbers including Mingma David Sherpa, co-owner of Elite Exped/Sherpa Extremes Pvt Ltd, reached Tibet to provide ground support for the project this autumn season. Last year, the Everest Ski Project, also gathered dust after China refused to issue a ski as well as entry permit to the team comprising expedition leader Conrad Anker and production head Jimmy Chin. This year too, Conrad failed to obtain Tibet entry permit. The project has locally been managed by Elite Exped, the guiding company owned by Nirmal 'Nims' Purja.","ski, couloir, hornbein, everest, project, camp, expedition, hilaree, face, route, sherpa, north, conrad, anker, morrison, the, fisher, chin, exped, descent"

The rapid and unprecedented development in the area of information technology has contributed hugely to the world's socio-economic development, while also inducing additional complexities and challenges in the security sector simultaneously, according to the President. He said the reports have advised diplomatic, strategic, economic, social, and security measures to be implemented ahead keeping the overall national security in the center with consideration to possible challenges due to international, regional, and national security scenarios. In accordance with Article 266(3) of the Constitution, the National Security Council shall submit its annual report to the President, and the President shall cause the report to be presented through the Prime Minister before the Federal Parliament.

The MoU was signed on Thursday in Seoul, the capital of South Korea, during a program where FNCCI President Chandra Prasad Dhakal and KOIMA President Bu-wang Kwan Kim participated. KOIMA is an organization established in South Korea to promote industrial raw material imports, especially goods not produced locally, to foster industrial development and make such goods accessible to the general public. FNCCI believes that collaboration with this import-focused organization will make it easier to expand Nepalese products in South Korea. This partnership is also expected to reduce the trade deficit between Nepal and South Korea, which currently stands at approximately Rs 7 billion. Currently, traditional items such as felt products, carpets, and yarn are among the main exports from Nepal to South Korea. FNCCI hopes that the partnership with KOIMA will also help explore markets for industrial raw materials and other goods. Speaking at an event organized to celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations between Nepal and South Korea and the signing of the MoU, FNCCI President Chandra Prasad Dhakal highlighted the immense potential for strengthening economic ties between the two countries. At the event titled ""Opportunities for Trade and Investment in Nepal,"" hosted by the Nepalese Embassy in Seoul under the chief patronage of Nepal's Minister for Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, Damodar Bhandari, President Dhakal stated that Nepal's young and energetic workforce, natural resources, and proximity to large markets make it an attractive destination for South Korean investors. Dhakal shared updates on recent progress in Nepal's investment climate, emphasizing reforms introduced with FNCCI's active involvement. He highlighted the government's initiatives to amend eight investment-related laws to create an investor-friendly environment and approved a bilateral investment agreement framework as a significant step toward facilitating foreign investments. Dhakal also mentioned Nepal's favorable economic indicators, noting that the country's foreign currency reserves have reached about USD 17 billion and that Nepal has received its first credit rating, which he said is satisfactory within the South Asian context. He underscored the importance of infrastructure development and urged South Korean expertise and investment in roads, railways, airports, urban planning, hotels, resorts, cable cars, and smart cities. Inviting the South Korean business community to explore trade and investment opportunities in Nepal, Dhakal assured them of full support through FNCCI's Foreign Investment Assistance Desk.

""Following the recent flood, we had over 10 flood-impacted patients in B&B hospitals. We have seen a significant increase in patients, in addition to several other diseases such as diarrhoea, dengue fever, and trauma caused by flooding,"" stated Dr. Thapa, Head of Emergency Department and Chief Consultant at B&B Hospital in Gwarko, Lalitpur. ""One dead victim from the flood was brought to the B&B immediately after the landslip,"" he said. ""She was a 65-year-old woman who was covered by a landslip for two hours in Sankha Devi, Lamatar area of Lalitpur. Another patient is still alive. She, too, is a victim of a landslide. These are the two major cases at B&B."" Dr. Thapa expressed belief that the aftermath of floods and landslides would make things more difficult for patients and victims. ""In addition, numerous places lack sanitation, which could exacerbate infectious diseases. So the disaster has passed, but a health disaster is looming if we fail to address it immediately. And if we do not do so, the situation will worsen. And we are prepared to work collaboratively because this is a national issue."" ""This needs to be addressed immediately through sanitation and screening. We should also check the water sanitation in the affected areas. Rehabilitation, resettlement, and counselling should all be expanded with government assistance. Because they could have lost numerous important documents and left without money to get food and in mental trauma."" ""Disasters are a common occurrence that necessitate a collaborative effort to mitigate their effects. Because disasters essentially mean challenges that outnumber our resources,"" he explained. ""So we all should come together to recover the resources, helping each other collaboratively because it requires multidimensional involvement,"" said Dr Thapa, who also serves as President of the Nepalese Society of Emergency Physicians. ""Hence, all stakeholders, including the health, social, and economic sectors, must collaborate to address the challenge. The victims might not have food, clothes and shelter. Because diarrhoeal diseases are going to significantly increase due to a lack of sanitation, and now is the time to start addressing these issues,"" he added. ""What I also anticipate in a few days is that indirect impacts from the disasters will cause significantly more damage,"" he told THT. ""For example, infectious diseases associated with sanitation, fever, waterborne diseases, and skin diseases are expected to rise."" He also stated that these indirect effects will endanger people's health security due to water shortages. Because there is a scarcity of pure, safe water. ""This is also going to increase psychosocial issues like stress, which will have an indirect impact on health,"" he said. ""This will exacerbate indirect health issues significantly. Because some patients could be discharged but are unable to leave because their home is flooded and unsafe. Furthermore, their socioeconomic status has deteriorated."" Dr. Thapa described this as the indirect impact because their home sanitation system has been completely destroyed. Dr. Thapa also explained the stages of disasters, such as direct impact (damages, wounds, and cuts) and the most dangerous impact (aftermath), which occurs when floods have ended but psychosocial, socioeconomic, and sanitation issues remain. Furthermore, their physical infrastructures are damaged, preventing them from returning home. He also stated that the health minister was scheduled to visit the hospital and check on the victims. Meanwhile, Minister of Health and Population Pradip Paudel visited the Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS) staff and urged them to make it easier for citizens to access services. During today's PAHS inspection, he emphasised the importance of improving the academy's services. ""The services here are comparatively better, and they need to be improved further,"" he said. ""The online service should be more effective."" PAHS Vice Chancellor Prof. Dr. Rajesh Nath Gongal stated that PAHS serves the greatest number of patients through its own funding and has requested that the Health Minister provide funding for the construction of a new hospital building.","indirect, health, the, diseases, flood, thapa, landslip, pahs, ajay, gongal, physicians, impact, dr, hospital, emergency, academy, nath, rajesh, sciences, disaster"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/the-importance-of-mental-health-in-nepalese-context,The importance of mental health in Nepalese Context,Anuka Limbu,2024-10-06 13:13:31,"October 10, 2024, as the world commemorates International Mental Health Day, Nepal continues to grapple with the challenges of mental health awareness. Despite recent strides in mental health advocacy, mental health remains a largely overlooked issue in the country, with significant gaps in awareness, access to care, and emotional regulation. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), rising Mental Health Concerns and mental health disorders in Nepal are on the rise, affecting a wide cross-section of the population, from children to the elderly. Depression and anxiety disorders are prevalent, exacerbated by the social and economic challenges faced by many Nepalese. The aftershocks of past natural disasters, such as the 2015 earthquake, coupled with the socio-political instability and economic hardships, have further intensified the mental health burden. A 2022 survey conducted by the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC) revealed that 18% of the population struggles with some form of mental health issue. Despite this, the country has only about 0.36 psychiatrists and 0.18 psychologists per 100,000 people, highlighting the dire shortage of mental health professionals. The stigma surrounding mental health remains a significant barrier to seeking help in Nepal. Mental health issues are often viewed as weaknesses or spiritual afflictions, leading many to suffer in silence. A lack of understanding about mental health disorders, combined with cultural and religious beliefs, fosters discrimination and neglect. In rural areas, especially, mental health is shrouded in misconceptions. People with mental health conditions are often labeled as ""mad"" or possessed by spirits. This deep-rooted stigma discourages individuals from speaking openly about their struggles or seeking medical help. As a result, many cases go untreated, leading to more severe outcomes, including suicide. The Ministry of Health and Population reports that suicide is now one of the leading causes of death among young Nepalese. Another critical issue is the lack of emotional literacy- the ability to identify, understand, and manage one's emotions. Emotional regulation, an essential component of mental well-being, is often neglected in discussions of mental health in Nepal. Children and adolescents, in particular, face challenges in managing stress, anxiety, and other emotional issues due to a lack of guidance on healthy emotional expression. Educational institutions in Nepal have begun recognizing the need for mental health education, but progress is slow. Emotional regulation programs are scarce, and many schools still prioritize academic achievements over mental health and emotional development. There are a few initiatives, such as workshops on mindfulness and emotional intelligence, that are slowly gaining momentum in urban centers, but these efforts have yet to reach a majority of Nepal's population. To combat these issues, several organizations are advocating for greater mental health awareness and care. Non-governmental organizations like TPO Nepal, Koshish, and the Centre for Mental Health and Counselling (CMC Nepal) are working tirelessly to provide support to individuals suffering from mental health disorders. These organizations offer counseling services, conduct awareness programs, and train healthcare professionals in rural and urban areas alike. Furthermore, Nepal's National Mental Health Policy, revised in 2020, emphasizes integrating mental health services into primary healthcare. This policy aims to provide accessible mental health care, reduce stigma, and promote emotional well-being. However, challenges such as limited resources and infrastructure continue to hinder full implementation. Addressing the mental health crisis in Nepal requires a concerted effort from all sectors of society. Increased funding for mental health services, widespread awareness campaigns, and incorporating emotional literacy into school curriculums are crucial steps to bridging the gap. Importantly, the destigmatization of mental health issues must be prioritized to create a more supportive and understanding environment for those in need. As we mark International Mental Health Day, the theme of ""Mental Health is a Universal Human Right"" resonates deeply with Nepal's ongoing challenges. By continuing to raise awareness and foster a culture of emotional intelligence and regulation, Nepal can take vital steps toward building a mentally healthier future for all its citizens.

It hadn't stopped raining for about 12 hours and the swollen river was getting dangerously close. When they felt the first reverberations through the living room floor, the family rushed out the door. The rest is a blur in Bishowraj's mind. He had only managed to stuff some money into his pocket. Barely 15 minutes later, the house caved in before their eyes. Bishowraj took his family to his brother's place, farther up from the river's edge. It was the morning of Saturday, Sept. 28, and the rain would continue for another day, causing landslides and floods in areas surrounding Kathmandu, Nepal's capital. More than 200 people were dead in the worst flooding to hit the region in five decades. Over 10 inches of rainfall fell in the Kathmandu Valley in two days, nearly 20% of the monthly average. The Bagmati River in Kathmandu inundated low-lying areas, damaging temporary shelters and forcing daily-wage squatters to seek safety away from the raging waters. Some of the urban dwellings were covered foot deep in mud and debris of broken tree limbs and damaged buildings. By Monday, the sun was out and Bishowraj and his wife Sharmila went back to what remained of their home to try and salvage whatever they could. The damage was extensive and Sharmila tried hard to find some cooking utensils that were intact. Elsewhere in the capital, earthmovers lifted parked vehicles out of the mud, and tried to flush the ground floors of the slime left by the receding floodwaters. Several highways leading to Kathmandu were damaged, causing traffic jams and disrupting supplies.","the, river, 200, utensils, bishowraj, reverberations, bishworaj, dwellings, nakhu, slime, jams, squatters, limbs, blur, pocket, wage, cook, floors, monthly, cooking"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/movie-review-the-substance-is-brilliantly-disgusting-and-deranged,Movie Review: 'The Substance' is brilliantly disgusting and deranged,Associated Press,2024-09-20 22:53:40,"NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 20 In its first two hours, ""The Substance"" is a well-made, entertaining movie. Writer-director Coralie Fargeat treats audiences to a heavy dose of biting social commentary on ageism and sexism in Hollywood, with a spoonful of sugar- and sparkle-doused body horror. But the film's deliciously unhinged, blood-soaked and inevitably polarizing third act is what makes it unforgettable. What begins as a dread-inducing but still relatively palatable sci-fi flick spirals deeper into absurdism and violence, eventually erupting - quite literally - into a full-blown monster movie. Let the viewer decide who the monster is. Fargeat - who won best screenplay at this year's Cannes Film Festival - has been vocal about her reverence for ""The Fly"" director David Cronenberg, and fans of the godfather of body horror will see his unmistakable influence. But ""The Substance"" is also wholly unique and benefits from Fargeat's perspective, which, according to the French filmmaker, has involved extensive grappling with her own relationship to her body and society's scrutiny. ""The Substance"" tells the story of Elisabeth Sparkle, a famed aerobics instructor with a televised show, played by a powerfully vulnerable Demi Moore. Sparkle is fired on her 50th birthday by a ruthless executive - a perfectly cast Dennis Quaid, who nails sleazy and gross. Feeling rejected by a town that once loved her and despairing over her bygone star power, Sparkle learns from a handsome young nurse about a black-market drug that promises to create a ""younger, more beautiful, more perfect"" version of its user. Though she initially tosses the phone number in the trash, she soon fishes it out in a desperate panic and places an order. The one rule to follow is that Sparkle and her better self (Margaret Qualley) must trade places every seven days. So for one week at a time, she is forced again to live as her 50-year-old self. But the allure of youth and a made-for-TV butt proves too strong to resist. What's the worst that can happen if she squeezes an extra day or two in? Benjamin Kracun's cinematography, particularly his low-angle shots and close-ups reminiscent of David Lynch's movies - another filmmaker Fargeat credits as having influenced her as a director - expertly capture the omnipresent claustrophobia and anxiety that exist even while Sparkle is in the body of her better self. Also evocative of Lynch is Fargeat's compelling construction - between the fashion, architecture, aerobics and highly advanced cell-replicating drugs - of a kind of atemporal world. Given that body horror has been all the rage at festivals - with Julia Ducournau's ""Titane"" and Cronenberg's ""Crimes of the Future"" also premiering at Cannes in recent years - it could be easy to write this movie off as capitalizing on the zeitgeist. But ""The Substance"" resists being lost in that shuffle. What is perhaps most impressive is the fact that, in its 140-minute runtime, the movie never feels like it's dragging on. Fargeat ups the ante until the last second of the film, with a jaw-droppingly deranged final scene that is still somehow poignant. If there's a critique to be made about the film, it's that the satire and caricatures are a bit heavy-handed, with most of the male characters being not-so-subtle misogynists. But that overkill is part of what makes it so much fun. ""The Substance,"" a Mubi release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for strong bloody violent content, gore, graphic nudity and language. Running time: 140 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.","movie, sparkle, fargeat, the, film, her, body, horror, substance, cronenberg, kracun, monster, ducournau, quaid, julia, coralie, filmmaker, cannes, fly, demi"

Her victory was part of a huge night for the Brooklyn-set comedy-drama, which won five Oscars, including best picture and directing honors for Sean Baker. ""Wow, this is very surreal,"" Madison said, having hugged Baker and others before taking the stage. ""Forgive me, I'm nervous,"" she said before reading off a list of names from a piece of paper. Madison had been best known for playing a sullen teenager in the FX comedy series ""Better Things,"" which ended in 2022. She also appeared in the hit movies ""Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood"" and the fifth installment of the horror franchise ""Scream."" Those jobs attracted the attention of director-writer Baker, who penned the title role in ""Anora"" for Madison. She studied Russian and did her own stunts in the film, in addition to learning to pole dance to play an exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch. ""I want to again recognize the sex worker community. I will continue to support and be an ally,"" Madison said onstage. The film debuted to critical acclaim at Cannes last year, winning the Palme d'Or. It has gained momentum ever since, with its box-office success easily outearning its $6 million budget. Hollywood veteran Demi Moore of ""The Substance"" had been the Oscar front-runner, having won over Madison at the Golden Globes and SAG Awards. However, Madison beat out Moore for the BAFTA two days before Oscar voting ended, as well as at last weekend's Independent Spirit Awards. She was born Mikaela Madison Rosberg in Los Angeles, one of five children of psychologist parents. Her mother signed her up for an acting class in her mid-teens after Madison had trained in competitive horseback riding, which she found lonely compared to the collaborative nature of acting. ""I grew up in Los Angeles but Hollywood always felt so far away from me,"" Madison said. ""This is a dream come true. I'm probably going to wake up tomorrow.""

https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-and-tech/bitcoin-investor-buys-an-entire-spacex-flight-for-the-ultimate-polar-adventure,Bitcoin investor buys an entire SpaceX flight for the ultimate polar adventure,Associated Press,2025-04-02 21:22:06,"CAPE CANAVERAL, APRIL 2 A bitcoin investor who bought a SpaceX flight for himself and three polar explorers blasted off Monday night on the first rocket ride to carry people over the North and South poles. Chun Wang, a Chinese-born entrepreneur, hurtled into orbit from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. SpaceX's Falcon rocket steered southward over the Atlantic, putting the space tourists on a path never flown before in 64 years of human spaceflight. Wang won't say how much he paid Elon Musk's SpaceX for the 3 ½-day ultimate polar adventure. The first leg of their flight - from Florida to the South Pole - took barely a half-hour. From the targeted altitude of some 270 miles (440 kilometers), their fully automated capsule will circle the globe in roughly 1 ½ hours including 46 minutes to fly from pole to pole. ""Enjoy the views of the poles. Send us some pictures,"" SpaceX Launch Control radioed once the capsule reached orbit. Wang has already visited the polar regions in person and wants to view them from space. The trip is also about ""pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge,"" he said ahead of the flight. Now a citizen of Malta, he took along three guests: Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge and Australian polar guide Eric Philips. Mikkelsen, the first Norwegian bound for space, has flown over the poles before, but at a much lower altitude. She was part of the 2019 record-breaking mission that circumnavigated the world via the poles in a Gulfstream jet to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's moon landing. The crew plans two dozen experiments - including taking the first human X-rays in space - and brought along more cameras than usual to document their journey called Fram2 after the Norwegian polar research ship from more than a century ago. Until now, no space traveler had ventured beyond 65 degrees north and south latitude, just shy of the Arctic and Antarctic circles. The first woman in space, the Soviet Union's Valentina Tereshkova, set that mark in 1963. Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and other pioneering cosmonauts came almost as close, as did NASA shuttle astronauts in 1990. A polar orbit is ideal for climate and Earth-mapping satellites as well as spy satellites. That's because a spacecraft can observe the entire world each day, circling Earth from pole to pole as it rotates below. Geir Klover, director of the Fram Museum in Oslo, Norway, where the original polar ship is on display, hopes the trip will draw more attention to climate change and the melting polar caps. He lent the crew a tiny piece of the ship's wooden deck that bears the signature of Oscar Wisting, who with Roald Amundsen in the early 1900s became the first to reach both poles. Wang pitched the idea of a polar flight to SpaceX in 2023, two years after U.S. tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman made the first of two chartered flights with Musk's company. Isaacman is now in the running for NASA's top job. SpaceX's Kiko Dontchev said late last week that the company is continually refining its training so ""normal people"" without traditional aerospace backgrounds can ""hop in a capsule ... and be calm about it."" Wang and his crew view the polar flight like camping in the wild and embrace the challenge. ""Spaceflight is becoming increasingly routine and, honestly, I'm happy to see that,"" Wang said via X last week. Wang said he's been counting up his flights since his first one in 2002, flying on planes, helicopters and hot air balloons in his quest to visit every country. So far, he's visited more than half.

According to a member of PCN's media monitoring committee, the council's decision was based solely on the 'content analysis' submitted by the Elite Exped team. ""None of the members of the board or the media monitoring panel, except for PCN Chairman Bal Krishna Basnet, were involved in the decision-making process,"" he said. Even after THT sought clarification regarding the move, PCN officials refused to acknowledge or register its immediate response. Meanwhile, Basnet left for the United States immediately after taking this arbitrary decision, thereby raising serious que-stions about the entire process. Surprisingly, a copy of the illegal and undemocratic order was shared by the PCN with Purja, who made it public through his social media handles yesterday morning, much before it was sent to THT. This suggests that THT was denied the right to respond to the allegations, indicating ulterior motives of vested interest groups - both within and outside the PCN.","pcn, purja, exped, elite, council, nims, bal, decision, nirmal, basnet, monitoring, kingdom, the, krishna, que, stions, motives, arbitrary, media, united"

The Sunset Fire was burning near the Hollywood Bowl and about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The streets around Grauman's Chinese Theatre and Madame Tussauds were packed with stop-and-go traffic as sirens blared and low-flying helicopters soared by on their way to dump water on the flames. People toting suitcases left hotels on foot, while some onlookers walked toward the flames, recording the fire on their phones. Winds eased up some Wednesday, a day after hurricane-force winds blew embers through the air, igniting block after block, and hundreds of firefighters from other states have arrived to help, but the four fires burning out of control showed the danger is far from over. More than half a dozen schools in the area were either damaged or destroyed, including Palisades Charter High School, which has been featured in many Hollywood productions, including the 1976 horror movie ""Carrie"" and the TV series ""Teen Wolf,"" officials said. UCLA has canceled classes for the week. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said air operations were dousing flames. She warned they still faced ""erratic winds,"" though not like Tuesday evening, when aircraft had to be grounded and much of the destruction occurred. In Pasadena, Fire Chief Chad Augustin said between 200 and 500 structures have been damaged or lost from the Eaton Fire that started Tuesday night. He said the city's water system was stretched and was further hampered by power outages, but even without those issues, firefighters would not have been able to stop the fire due to the intense winds fanning the flames. ""Those erratic wind gusts were throwing embers for multiple miles ahead of the fire,"" he said. On the Pacific Coast west of downtown Los Angeles, a major fire leveled entire blocks, reducing grocery stores and banks to rubble in the Pacific Palisades, a hillside area along the coast dotted with celebrity homes and memorialized by the Beach Boys in their 1960s hit ""Surfin' USA."" The Palisades fire was the most destructive in the Los Angeles history, with at least 1,000 structures burned. The scope of the destruction was just becoming clear: Block after block of California Mission Style homes and bungalows were reduced to nothing but charred remains dotted by stone fireplaces and blackened arched entryways. Ornate iron railing wrapped around the smoldering frame of one house. The apocalyptic scenes spread for miles. Swimming pools were blackened with soot, and sports cars slumped on melted tires. As flames moved through his neighborhood, Jose Velasquez sprayed down his family's Altadena home with water as embers rained down on the roof. He managed to save their home, which also houses their family business of selling churros, a Mexican pastry. Others weren't so lucky. Many of his neighbors were at work when they lost their homes. ""So we had to call a few people and then we had people messaging, asking if their house was still standing,"" he said. ""We had to tell them that it's not."" Beyond the burned areas, residents worked wearing N95 masks, unable to escape the toxic smoke wafting over huge sections of the city. Actors lost homes The flames marched toward highly populated and affluent neighborhoods, including Calabasas and Santa Monica, home to California's rich and famous. Mandy Moore, Cary Elwes and Paris Hilton are among the stars who said Wednesday they lost homes. Billy Crystal and his wife Janice lost their home of 45 years in the Palisades Fire. ""We raised our children and grandchildren here. Every inch of our house was filled with love. Beautiful memories that can't be taken away,"" the Crystals wrote in the statement. In Palisades Village, the public library, two major grocery stores, a pair of banks and several boutiques were destroyed. ""It's just really weird coming back to somewhere that doesn't really exist anymore,"" said Dylan Vincent, who returned to the neighborhood to retrieve some items and saw that his elementary school had burned down and that whole blocks had been flattened. The fires have consumed a total of about 42 square miles (108 square kilometers) - nearly the size of the entire city of San Francisco. Fast-moving flames allowed little time to escape Flames moved so quickly that many barely had time to escape. Police sought shelter inside their patrol cars, and residents at a senior living center were pushed in wheelchairs and hospital beds down a street to safety. In the race to get away in Pacific Palisades, roadways became impassable when scores of people abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot. Higher temperatures and less rain mean a longer fire season California's wildfire season is beginning earlier and ending later due to rising temperatures and decreased rainfall tied to climate change, according to recent data. Rains that usually end fire season are often delayed, meaning fires can burn through the winter months, according to the Western Fire Chiefs Association. Dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, which has not seen more than 0.1 inches (2.5 millimeters) of rain since early May. The winds increased to 80 mph (129 kph) Wednesday, according to reports received by the National Weather Service. Forecasters predicted wind gusts of 35-55 mph (56 to 88 kph) that could rise higher in the mountains and foothills. Fire conditions could last through Friday. Landmarks get scorched and studios suspend production President Joe Biden signed a federal emergency declaration after arriving at a Santa Monica fire station for a briefing with Gov. Gavin Newsom, who dispatched National Guard troops to help. Several Hollywood studios suspended production, and Universal Studios closed its theme park between Pasadena and Pacific Palisades. As of Wednesday evening, more than 456,000 people were without power in southern California, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us. Several Southern California landmarks were heavily damaged, including the Reel Inn in Malibu, a seafood restaurant. Owner Teddy Leonard and her husband hope to rebuild. ""When you look at the grand scheme of things, as long as your family is well and everyone's alive, you're still winning, right?"" she said.","fire, los, angeles, the, hollywood, palisades, california, winds, pacific, coast, flames, santa, studios, grocery, augustin, leonard, hills, stores, their, temperatures"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/what-to-know-about-thousands-of-evacuations-and-homes-burned-in-los-angeles-area-fires,What to know about thousands of evacuations and homes burned in Los Angeles-area fires,Associated Press,2025-01-10 11:56:36,"LOS ANGELES, JANUARY 10 At least 10 people were killed and thousands of structures were burned as fierce wildfires raged in the Los Angeles area, officials said. Fast-moving flames blazed through homes and businesses as residents fled smoke-filled canyons and picturesque neighborhoods that are home to many celebrities. Many of the towering fires that began Tuesday were fueled by powerful Santa Ana winds, which gusted to more than 70 mph (112 kph) in some spots. The winds dropped Thursday, but the National Weather Service warned that even the reduced gusts could still spread fire rapidly and the wind is expected to strengthen again Thursday evening. Another round of strong winds may form Tuesday. The exact death toll remained unclear, but it was expected to rise as crews begin to search the rubble. Gov. Gavin Newsom said California has deployed more than 1,400 firefighting personnel to battle the blazes. Oregon, Washington, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona dispatched teams to assist. AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, increased its estimate of the damage and economic loss to $135 billion to $150 billion. Government officials have not yet released any damage estimates. Here's what to know about the fires: The Palisades Fire is the most destructive in LA history More than 5,300 structures have been damaged or destroyed in the hilly coastal neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, making it the most destructive fire in Los Angeles history. Dozens of blocks were flattened to smoldering rubble, with only the outlines of homes and their chimneys left. The wreckage surpassed that of the Sayre Fire of November 2008, which destroyed 604 structures in Sylmar, the northernmost suburb of the city, according to statistics kept by the Wildfire Alliance, a partnership between the city's fire department and MySafe:LA. Over 30 square miles (77 square kilometers) burned in Pacific Palisades, which is dotted with celebrity homes and was memorialized by the Beach Boys in their 1960s hit ""Surfin' USA."" The flames torched iconic landmarks including part of Palisades Charter High School, which has been featured in many Hollywood productions, including the 1976 horror movie ""Carrie"" and the TV series ""Teen Wolf."" Actor Billy Crystal and his wife Janice lost their home of 45 years. Other fires are also causing havoc Farther inland, the Eaton Fire north of Pasadena burned more than 5,000 structures, which includes homes, apartment or commercial buildings and vehicles. It also substantially damaged five school campuses in Altadena and scorched more than 21 square miles (54 square kilometers). Employees at a senior center pushed dozens of residents in wheelchairs and hospital beds to a parking lot to escape. The Los Angeles Fire Department issued evacuation orders Thursday afternoon for a new blaze, named the Kenneth Fire, which broke out near West Hills, a neighborhood densely packed with homes in the San Fernando Valley about 11 miles (18 kilometers) northwest of Pacific Palisades. It ballooned in size, charring more than 1 square mile (2.6 kilometers) within hours of igniting, and forced evacuations. The Hurst Fire, which started Tuesday night, prompted evacuations in Sylmar in the San Fernando Valley. And in the Hollywood Hills, the Sunset Fire broke out Wednesday evening and burned near the Hollywood Bowl and other iconic landmarks. Firefighters were able to manage the flames, and evacuation orders were lifted Thursday morning. Altogether the fires have consumed about 55 square miles (142 square kilometers) - larger than the size of San Francisco. Biden approves additional funding President Joe Biden said during a White House briefing with staff Thursday that he was making federal resources available and approved additional funding to help California battle the fires, saying they were the ""worst fires to ever hit Los Angeles. Ever."" The new funding will cover 100% of the cost for 180 days for hazardous materials removal, temporary shelters, first responder salaries and measures to protect life, he said. Biden said he was not in a position to answer whether California would continue to receive federal funding to help combat the fires after President-elect Donald Trump takes office Jan. 20. ""I pray to God they will,"" Biden said. Thousands have been ordered to evacuate Nearly 180,000 people were under evacuation orders Thursday. The flames threatened highly populated and affluent neighborhoods, including Calabasas and Santa Monica, home to California's rich and famous. Hollywood stars including Mark Hamill, Mandy Moore and James Woods were among those forced to flee, and Moore later said she lost her home in Altadena. Bad air quality is affecting millions A thick cloud of smoke and ash filled the skies, prompting air and dust advisories for 17 million people across a vast stretch of Southern California, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. The worst conditions were in the vicinity of the fires. In East Los Angeles, the air quality index hit an unhealthy 173. Good air quality is considered to be 50 or less. Dr. Puneet Gupta, the assistant medical director for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said wildfire smoke can cause heart attacks and worsen asthma, while burning homes can release cyanide and carbon dioxide. Several events have been canceled and postponed The Critics Choice Awards rescheduled Sunday ceremonies in Santa Monica for Jan. 26. The organization that puts on the Oscars extended the voting window for Academy Award nominations and delayed next week's planned nominations announcement. Film studios canceled two movie premieres. The Universal Studios Hollywood theme park closed for the day, but Disneyland, which is farther from the fires in Anaheim, remained open. Universal Studios also canceled shooting for numerous series, including ""Hacks,"" ""Ted Lasso"" and ""Suits LA."" All schools were closed Thursday and were to remain closed Friday in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The NFL has moved the Los Angeles Rams' wild-card playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings to Arizona because of the fires. The game will be played Monday night at the home of the Arizona Cardinals in suburban Glendale, Arizona. The NBA postponed the Lakers' game against the Hornets, and the NFL said it is monitoring conditions to determine if Monday's playoff game between the Los Angeles Rams and Minnesota Vikings will be affected. Many people are without power and water More than 285,000 customers were without electricity in Southern California, nearly half of them in Los Angeles County, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide. Sewer, water and power infrastructure across the region has been significantly damaged, officials said. Authorities warn looters Looters who take advantage of the wildfire crisis by targeting vulnerable communities will be prosecuted, officials promised. There have been at least 20 arrests. ""This is simply unacceptable,"" Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger said. ""I promise you, you will be held accountable."" Officials planned to implement a curfew around the two main fires as early as Thursday evening, and National Guard members were expected to be stationed near burn areas.","angeles, los, the, fire, hollywood, fires, studios, than, square, more, rams, kilometers, air, wildfire, minnesota, looters, quality, funding, palisades, universal"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/los-angeles-wildfires-death-toll-rises-as-crews-fight-heavy-winds-to-save-homes-and-landmarks,Los Angeles wildfires death toll rises as crews fight heavy winds to save homes and landmarks,Associated Press,2025-01-12 15:26:20,"LOS ANGELES, JANUARY 12 The death toll from the wildfires ravaging the Los Angeles area rose to 16 as crews battled to cut off the spreading blazes before potentially strong winds return that could push the flames toward some of the city's most famous landmarks. Five of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire and 11 resulted from the Eaton Fire, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said in a statement Saturday evening. The previous number of confirmed fatalities before Saturday was 11, but officials said they expected that figure to rise as teams with cadaver dogs conduct systematic grid searches in leveled neighborhoods. Authorities have established a center where people can report the missing. There were fears that winds could move the fires toward the J. Paul Getty Museum and the University of California, Los Angeles, while new evacuation warnings left more homeowners on edge. By Saturday evening, Cal Fire reported the Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth and Hurst fires had consumed about 62 square miles (160 square kilometers), an area larger than San Francisco. The Palisades and Eaton fires accounted for 59 square miles (nearly 153 square kilometers). In a briefing posted online Saturday evening, Michael Traum of the California Office of Emergency Services said 150,000 people in Los Angeles County were under evacuation orders, with more than 700 people taking refuge in nine shelters. Crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico, he said. With Cal Fire reporting containment of the Palisades Fire at 11% and the Eaton Fire at 15% on Saturday night, the fight is set to continue. ""Weather conditions are still critical and another round of strong winds is expected starting Monday,"" Traum said. Fighting to save public and private areas A fierce battle occurred Saturday in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities not far from the Pacific coast, where swooping helicopters dumped water as the blaze charged downhill. Firefighters on the ground used hoses in an attempt to beat back leaping flames as thick smoke blanketed the chaparral-covered hillside. CalFire Operations Chief Christian Litz said Saturday that a main focus was the Palisades Fire burning in the canyon area, not far from the UCLA campus. New evacuations were ordered Friday evening after a flare up on the eastern side of the Palisades Fire. The National Weather Service warned that strong Santa Ana winds could soon return. Those winds have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around to city where there has been no significant rainfall in more than eight months. The fire also threatened to jump over Interstate 405 and into densely populated areas in the Hollywood Hills and San Fernando Valley. Historical cost The fires that began Tuesday just north of downtown LA have burned more than 12,000 structures. Firefighters for the first time made progress Friday afternoon on the Eaton Fire north of Pasadena, which has burned more than 7,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles. Most evacuation orders for the area were lifted, officials said. No cause has been determined for the largest fires and early estimates indicate the wildfires could be the nation's costliest ever. A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. Overflowing kindness Volunteers overflowed donation centers and some had to be turned away at locations including the Santa Anita Park horse racing track, where people who lost their homes sifted through stacks of donated shirts, blankets and other household goods. Altadena resident Jose Luis Godinez said three homes occupied by more than a dozen of his family members were destroyed. ""Everything is gone,"" he said, speaking in Spanish. ""All my family lived in those three houses and now we have nothing."" Officials warn against returning Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna warned residents against venturing back to destroyed homes to sift through rubble for keepsakes. ""We have people driving up and around trying to get in just to look. Stay away,"" Luna said, urging people to abide by curfews. Officials on Saturday warned the ash can contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other harmful materials. ""If you're kicking that stuff up, you're breathing it in,"" said Chris Thomas, a spokesman for the unified incident command at the Palisades Fire who warned the material was ""toxic."" Residents will be allowed to return with protective gear after damage teams evaluate their properties, Thomas said. Leadership accused of skimping LA Mayor Karen Bass faces a critical test of her leadership during the city's greatest crisis in decades, but allegations of leadership failures, political blame and investigations have begun. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon (440 million-liter) reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry. Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water. ""When a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there's going to be water,"" Crowley said. The level of devastation is jarring even in a state that regularly confronts massive wildfires. Traum of the state Office of Emergency Services said those impacted by the fires can apply online for immediate government assistance.","angeles, los, the, fire, fires, than, more, winds, canyon, 000, palisades, eaton, office, santa, california, godinez, litz, evacuation, leadership, county"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/los-angeles-wildfire-death-toll-surges-to-24-as-firefighters-brace-for-more-fierce-winds,Los Angeles wildfire death toll surges to 24 as firefighters brace for more fierce winds,Associated Press,2025-01-13 13:51:34,"LOS ANGELES, JANUARY 13 After a weekend spent blocking the explosive growth of fires that destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 24 people in the Los Angeles area, firefighters got a slight break with calmer weather but cast a wary eye on a forecast for yet more wind. Should that happen, already burned homes and valleys could flare anew, sending embers to unburned territory miles downwind. New fires could add to the complication. The death toll surged late Sunday with an update from the Los Angeles County medical examiner. At least 16 people were missing, a number authorities said was also likely to rise. The relative calm Sunday allowed some people to return to previously evacuated areas, however. The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions through Wednesday, with sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph) and gusts in the mountains reaching 70 mph (113 kph). The most dangerous day will be Tuesday, warned fire behavior analyst Dennis Burns at a community meeting Sunday night. ""It will kind of ebb and flow over the next couple days,"" Burns said. ""Tomorrow night, it will really ramp up."" Spotting - new fires caused by blowing embers - could happen as much as 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) or more downwind of areas that have already burned, Burns said. Despite their recent losses, stress, and uncertainty, the crowd in a Pasadena City College gym was mostly respectful, in contrast with harsh criticism elsewhere for Los Angeles and California leaders. Applause followed each of the experts, police, firefighters and community leaders who spoke. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said 70 additional water trucks arrived to help firefighters fend off flames spread by renewed gusts. ""We are prepared for the upcoming wind event,"" Marrone said. Fire retardant dropped by aircraft will act as a barrier along hillsides, officials said. Fierce Santa Ana winds have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires sparked last week into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around the city where there has been no significant rainfall in more than eight months. Twelve people were missing within the Eaton Fire zone and four were missing from the Palisades Fire, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. Investigators were reconciling whether some of the missing might be among the dead but so far no children were among those reported missing, he said. Meanwhile, the death toll rose to 24 over the weekend. Eight deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire and 16 to the Eaton Fire, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office. The toll could rise still more as cadaver dogs conducted systematic searches in leveled neighborhoods. Authorities established a center where people could report the missing. Officials also were building an online database to allow evacuated residents to see if their homes were damaged or destroyed. In the meantime, LA city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley urged people to stay away from scorched neighborhoods. ""There are still active fires that are burning within the Palisades area, making it extremely, extremely dangerous for the public,"" Crowley said at a Sunday morning briefing. ""There's no power, there's no water, there's broken gas lines, and we have unstable structures."" Officials warned the ash can contain lead, arsenic, asbestos and other harmful materials. About 150,000 people in Los Angeles County remained under evacuation orders, with more than 700 residents taking refuge in nine shelters, Luna said. Officials said most of the orders in the Palisades area were unlikely to be lifted before the red flag warnings expire Wednesday evening. ""Please rest assured that first thing Thursday we will begin talking about repopulation,"" Marrone said. In all, four fires had consumed more than 62 square miles (160 square kilometers), an area larger than San Francisco. The Palisades Fire was 11% contained and containment on the Eaton Fire reached 27%. Those two blazes alone accounted for 59 square miles (nearly 153 square kilometers). Crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes nearly 1,400 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico. Fighting to save public and private areas After a fierce battle Saturday, firefighters managed to fight back flames in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities near Pacific Palisades not far from the coast, where swooping helicopters dumped water as the blaze charged downhill. The fire ran through chaparral-covered hillsides and also briefly threatened to jump over Interstate 405 and into densely populated areas in the Hollywood Hills and San Fernando Valley. Arrests for looting Looting continued to be a concern, with authorities reporting more arrests as the devastation grew. Those arrested included two people who posed as firefighters going into houses, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Michael Lorenz said. With California National Guard troops on hand to guard properties, Gov. Gavin Newsom posted on X: ""California will NOT allow for looting."" Historical cost The fires that began Tuesday just north of downtown LA had burned more than 12,000 structures. No cause for the largest fires was determined. Early estimates suggest they could be the nation's costliest ever, as much as $150 billion according to an AccuWeather estimate. Inmate firefighters on the front lines Along with crews from other states and Mexico, hundreds of inmates from California's prison system were also helping fight the fires. Nearly 950 prison firefighters were removing timber and brush ahead of the fires to slow their spread, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The practice is controversial as the inmates are paid little for dangerous and difficult work: $10.24 each day, with more for 24-hour shifts, according to the corrections department. Rebuilding will be a challenge Newsom issued an executive order Sunday aimed at fast-tracking rebuilding by suspending some environmental regulations and ensuring that property tax assessments were not increased. ""We've got to let people know that we have their back,"" he said. ""We want you to come back, rebuild, and rebuild with higher quality building standards, more modern standards."" More than 24,000 people had registered for federal assistance made available by a major disaster declaration by President Joe Biden, according to the White House. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Sunday that she had spoken with President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration and expected that he would visit the city. Leadership accused of skimping Bass faces a critical test of her leadership during the city's greatest crisis in decades, but allegations of leadership failures, political blame and investigations have begun. Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon (440 million-liter) reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry.","los, angeles, fire, the, fires, california, more, county, than, palisades, corrections, as, 000, toll, 24, miles, firefighters, neighborhoods, city, department"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/a-second-wind-whipped-wildfire-is-burning-out-of-control-in-the-los-angeles-area,A second wind-whipped wildfire is burning out of control in the Los Angeles area,Associated Press,2025-01-08 11:59:03,"LOS ANGELES, JANUARY 8 A fast-moving wildfire broke out Tuesday in the inland foothills northeast of Los Angeles hours after another blaze tore through the city's Pacific Palisades neighborhood along the coast, destroying many homes and prompting evacuation orders for tens of thousands. The Eaton fire in Altadena started near a nature preserve just before 6:30 p.m. The flames spread so rapidly that staff at a senior care center had to push dozens of residents in wheelchairs and hospital beds down the street to a parking lot where they waited in their bedclothes for ambulances and other vehicles to take them to safety. To the west, the Pacific Palisades fire that started Tuesday morning burned out of control into the night. The Los Angeles Fire Department put out a plea for off-duty firefighters to help fight the flames that were being pushed by winds topping 60 mph (97 kph) in some places and creating chaotic scenes as residents fled. It was too windy for firefighting aircraft to fly, hampering the fight. The Pacific Palisades fire swept through a Los Angeles hillside dotted with celebrity residences Tuesday, burning homes and prompting evacuation orders. In the frantic haste to get to safety, roadways were clogged and scores of people abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot, some toting suitcases. The traffic jam on Palisades Drive prevented emergency vehicles from getting through and a bulldozer was brought in to push the abandoned cars to the side and create a path, according to the LA Fire Department. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was in Southern California to attend the naming of a national monument by President Joe Biden, made a detour to the canyon to see ""firsthand the impact of these swirling winds and the embers,"" and he said he found ""not a few - many structures already destroyed."" Officials did not give an exact number of structures damaged or destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire, but they said about 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders and more than 13,000 structures were under threat. And the worst could be yet to come. The blaze began around 10:30 a.m., shortly after the start of a Santa Ana windstorm that the National Weather service warned could be ""life threatening"" and the strongest to hit Southern California in more than a decade. The exact cause of the fire was unknown and no injuries had been reported, officials said. Only about 25 miles (about 40 kilometers) northeast in Altadena, the Eaton fire was burning. The winds were expected to increase overnight and continue for days, producing isolated gusts that could top 100 mph (160 kph) in mountains and foothills - including in areas that haven't seen substantial rain in months. ""By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,"" Newsom warned residents, saying the worst of the winds are expected between 10 p.m. Tuesday and 5 a.m. Wednesday. He declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. As of Tuesday evening, 28,300 households were without power due to the strong winds, according to the mayor's office. About 15,000 utility customers in Southern California had their power shut off to reduce the risk of equipment sparking a blaze. A half a million customers total were at risk of losing power preemptively. The Pacific Palisades fire quickly consumed about 4.6 square miles (11.6 square kilometers) of land in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles, sending up a dramatic plume of smoke visible across the city. Residents in Venice Beach, some 6 miles (10 kilometers) away, reported seeing the flames. It was one of several blazes across the area. Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. But other roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to get out of danger and waited to be picked up. Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was completely blocked. Ash fell all around them while fires burned on both sides of the road. ""We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,"" Trainor said. ""People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an hour."" An Associated Press video journalist saw a roof and chimney of one home in flames and another residence where the walls were burning. The Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which borders Malibu about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of downtown LA, includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes along winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and stretches down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean. An AP photographer saw multi-million dollar mansions on fire as helicopters overhead dropped water loads. Roads were clogged in both directions as evacuees fled down toward the Pacific Coast Highway while others begged for rides back up to their homes to rescue pets. Two of the homes on fire were inside exclusive gated communities. Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he immediately went to pick his two kids up from St. Matthews Parish School when he heard the fire was nearby. Meanwhile, he said embers flew into his wife's car as she tried to evacuate. ""She vacated her car and left it running,"" Adams said. She and many other residents walked down toward the ocean until it was safe. Adams said he had never witnessed anything like this in the 56 years he's lived there. He watched as the sky turned brown and then black as homes started burning. He could hear loud popping and bangs ""like small explosions,"" which he said he believes were the transformers exploding. ""It is crazy, it's everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the Palisades. One home's safe, the other one's up in flames,"" Adams said. Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. ""Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,"" Woods said in the short video on X. Actor Steve Guttenberg, who lives in the Pacific Palisades, urged people who abandoned their cars to leave their keys behind so they could be moved to make way for fire trucks. ""This is not a parking lot,"" Guttenberg told KTLA. ""I have friends up there and they can't evacuate. ... I'm walking up there as far as I can moving cars."" The erratic weather caused Biden to cancel plans to travel to inland Riverside County, where he was to announce the establishment of two new national monuments in the state. He remained in Los Angeles, where smoke was visible from his hotel, and was briefed on the wildfires. The Federal Emergency Management Agency approved a grant to help reimburse California for the firefighting cost. Biden said in a statement that he and his team are communicating with state and local officials and he has offered ""any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire."" Some trees and vegetation on the grounds of the Getty Villa were burned by late Tuesday, but staff and the museum collection remain safe, Getty President Katherine Fleming said in a statement. The museum located on the eastern end of the Pacific Palisades is a separate campus of the world-famous Getty Museum that focuses on the art and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. The fire also burned Palisades Charter High School classrooms. Film studios canceled two movie premieres due to the fire and windy weather, and the Los Angeles Unified School District said it temporarily relocated students from three campuses in the Pacific Palisades area. Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, where there's been very little rain so far this season. Southern California hasn't seen more than 0.1 inches (0.25 centimeters) of rain since early May.","palisades, pacific, the, fire, angeles, los, getty, woods, santa, about, museum, coast, neighborhood, winds, kilometers, miles, weather, ocean, flames, blaze"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/its-not-really-the-typical-time-for-nasty-california-fires-what-are-the-factors-that-changed-that,It's not really the typical time for nasty California fires. What are the factors that changed that?,Associated Press,2025-01-09 20:25:13,"CALIFORNIA, JANUARY 9 Southern California is experiencing its most devastating winter fires in more than four decades. Fires don't usually blaze at this time of year, but specific ingredients have come together to defy the calendar in a fast and deadly manner. Start with supersized Santa Ana winds whipping flames and embers at 100 mph - much faster than normal - and cross that with the return of extreme drought. Add on weather whiplash that grew tons of plants in downpours then record high temperatures that dried them out to make easy-to-burn fuel. Then there's a plunging and unusual jet stream, and lots of power lines flapping in those powerful gusts. Experts say that's what is turning wildfires into a deadly urban conflagration. Speed is the killer ""Tiny, mighty and fast"" fires have blazed through America's west in the last couple of decades as the world warms, said University of Colorado fire scientist Jennifer Balch. She published a study in the journal Science last October that looked at 60,000 fires since 2001 and found that the fastest-growing ones have more than doubled in frequency since 2001 and caused far more destruction that slower, larger blazes. ""Fires have gotten faster,"" Balch said Wednesday. ""The big culprit we're suspecting is a warming climate that's making it easier to burn fuels when conditions are just right."" Summer fires are bigger usually, but they don't burn nearly as fast. Winter fires ""are much more destructive because they happen much more quickly"" said U.S. Geological Survey fire scientist Jon Keeley. AccuWeather estimated damage from the latest fires could reach $57 billion, with the private firm's chief meteorologist, Jonathan Porter, saying ""it may become the worst wildfire in modern California history based on the number of structures burned and economic loss."" Conditions are ideal ""It's really just the perfect alignment of everything in the atmosphere to give you this pattern and strong wind,"" said Tim Brown, director of the Western Regional Climate Center. Wind speed and the speed of spreading flames are clearly linked. ""The impact increases exponentially as wind speed increases,"" said fire scientist Mike Flannigan of Thompson Rivers University in Canada. If firefighters can get to the flames within 10 minutes or so, its spread can be contained, but ""15 minutes, it's too late and it's gone. The horse has left the barn."" There's no sure link between Santa Ana winds - gusts from the east that come down the mountains, gain speed and hit the coast - to human-caused climate change, said Daniel Swain, climate scientist for the California Institute for Water Resources. But a condition that led to those winds is a big plunge in the temperature of the jet stream - the river of air that moves weather systems across the globe - which helped bring cold air to the eastern two-thirds of the nation, said University of California Merced climate and fire scientist John Abatzoglou. Other scientists have preliminarily linked those jet stream plunges to climate change. Santa Ana winds are happening later and later in the year, moving more from the drier fall to the wetter winter, Keeley said. Normally, that would reduce fire threats, but this isn't a normal time. Dry fuel makes it worse After two soaking winters, when atmospheric rivers dumped huge amounts of water on the region causing lots of plants to grow, a fast onset of drought dried them out, providing perfect tinder, according to Swain and Abatzoglou. Swain says this weather whiplash is happening more often. There is a clear link between climate change and the more frequent dry falls and winters that provide fuel for fires, Swain said. These devastating fires couldn't happen without the dry and hot conditions, nor would they be blazing without the extreme wind speed, Abatzoglou and others said. It's also a people problem The human factor in this can't be ignored, said Keeley. ""I think that we need to look at it from the perspective of global changes. And climate is just one global change. And certainly one of the other important global changes is population growth. And California has been growing at a phenomenal rate in the last 20 years,"" Keeley said. ""You add more people and that means you add more power lines and more potential for failure to occur."" While the ignition sources for these fires have yet to be determined, Flannigan bets they'll end up being power lines blown down by high winds. That's what started California's devastating fires in 2016 and 2017, leading to utility Pacific Gas & Electric declaring bankruptcy after facing $30 billion in lawsuits. The calendar seems wrong An analysis of 423 California wildfires that have grown to at least 15 square miles (39 square kilometers) since 1984 shows only four of those burned during the winter. About two-thirds of those larger fires sparked in June, July or August. Federal data shows just six wildfires have burned more than 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) in any January in California since 1984. Until the Palisades and Eaton fires this year, the largest had been the Viejas Fire, which burned 17.1 square miles (44.3 square kilometers) in 2001 in the mountains east of San Diego. ""Winter wildfires should be an oxymoron,"" University of Colorado's Balch said. ""Well, because, you know, temperatures drop and we get precipitation. We're supposed to get precipitation."" Fire officials used to talk about fire seasons, said David Acuña, a battalion chief for Cal Fire: ""Now we talk about fire years.""","fires, california, the, fire, winter, speed, wind, ana, square, winds, santa, climate, scientist, jet, thirds, stream, keeley, flannigan, wildfires, whiplash"

With this addition, the total number of bird species identified in the district has reached 666, highlighting Chitwan's remarkable biodiversity. The observation was made during a birdwatching expedition in the Meghauli area of western Chitwan. A team of naturalists from Meghauli Serai, a Taj Safari, including Santosh Basnet, Ashwin Gurung, Swastika, and Sandip Mahato, documented a juvenile individual of the species in a field near the hotel premises. The sighting was further corroborated by Hathan Chaudhary, President of Bird Conservation Nepal (BCN), and Manish Limbu, President of the Meghauli Ghatgai Nature Guide Association, who also observed the bird in the same area later in the day. Historical Context and Conservation Significance The Black-headed Bunting was first recorded in Nepal in 1971 by R.L. Fleming Jr. during winter in the Rara-Jumla region. Subsequent sightings have been sporadic, with records from the Annapurna Conservation Area in 1993, 1996, 2003, 2004, and 2022. The species has also been documented in the Makalu Barun National Park twice in 2005 and in Rara National Park the same year. These records are prominently listed in Nepal's Red Data Book of endangered birds. New Insights into Habitat Range According to Chaudhary, this sighting represents a noteworthy finding as the species, typically observed at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 4,100 meters above sea level, was recorded at its lowest altitude ever in Nepal-143 meters. This discovery provides new insights into the ecological adaptability and distribution of the species, underscoring the importance of continued monitoring and conservation efforts in the region. Acknowledgment The collaborative effort of local naturalists and conservation organizations in documenting this rare visitor reflects a shared commitment to preserving Nepal's rich avian diversity.","conservation, meghauli, bunting, bird, the, species, insights, ghatgai, barun, taj, sighting, headed, makalu, rara, chitwan, black, safari, visitor, area, park"

At the hospital, she was told that she needed steel to be installed in her right leg, but it turned out that she couldn't afford the installation. Desperate, Jaula Devi called Prakash Singh, seeking help. She was told to manage Rs 550,000 for the treatment, which she couldn't manage. The journalist rescued the woman and took her to Kathmandu. Thanks to the collaboration with Badimalika Foundation Nepal and Medical Rehabilitation Organization, she is now undergoing treatment at Kist Medical College. In another case, Omu Mijar, 12, of Bajura's Badimalika Municipality-5 was battling for his life. Having been diagnosed as having a stone in his urinary bladder, he was referred by the district hospital to a better health facility for a surgery to extract the stone. But his treatment couldn't happen for a long time as the family didn't have any funds to take the child to a better health facility out of the district and afford the treatment. Thanks to Prakash, who, upon learning the plight of the orphaned child, brought to Kathmandu. He returned home later, cured. Yet in another case, Lal Damai of Bajhang, Talkot-5 suffered from a condition called clubbed foot. No one in his own family knew that the condition could be treated. Upon learning the plight of the five-year-old, Prakash, by collaborating with HRDC Banepa, brought him to Kathmandu. His treatment is undergoing now and it's expected to take five months for him to be cured. These are a few cases to name. Prakash has indeed saved many lives and rescued many stranded children, not only from Bajura but different other places as well. Prakash had started his journalistic career with The Himalayan Times around 14 years ago from his own village. Over the years, while he has evolved in his career as journalist, he has also dedicated himself to philanthropy. So far, he has rescued 131 stranded children, while he is also helping in the education of 10 depraved kids across the country. While Bayalpata Hospital and District Hospital of Bajura remember Prakash for the treatment of stranded patients, even the local levels turn to Prakash when there is anyone stranded or patients who are in need of treatment but cannot afford the cost. ""With a background as a health worker, he (Prakash) has provided millions of rupees worth of assistance to dozens of people in Bajura by carrying news about them and thus raising funds for them,"" said a civil society leader Dayaram Pandit. ""I prioritize the rescue of those who are in difficulty and need help,"" said the journalist. Federation of Nepalese Journalists Bajura chapter's former chairperson, Prakash has donated 86,000 rupees that he accrued as meeting allowance over the past four years to the needy.","hospital, bajura, the, jaula, bayalpata, pandit, tribeni, badimalika, treatment, district, dayaram, municipality, his, prakash, journalist, stranded, stone, rupees, devi, kist"

However, experts have criticised PM Oli's remarks as unscientific and preposterous. Shristi Singh Bhandari, a conservationist and animal rights activist, told THT, ""The Prime Minister's remarks are unscientific and preposterous."" ""He is not a lay person, he is the Prime Minister of Nepal. So this is careless and dangerous and very stupid. Regarding conflict between tigers and humans , it is not that the tigers are more, it is their habitat that is being encroached,"" she added. PM Oli went on to say that more than 150 tigers in Nepal should be given as gifts to friendly countries. Pointing to the recent spike in human deaths from tiger attacks, he said, ""Our is a small country with 350 tigers...150 will be sufficient. We cannot sustain tigers while endangering human lives."" PM Oli sarcastically stated that foreign experts had come to teach Nepal how to protect tigers, and that attention should be paid to the tiger carrying capacity. ""Nepal has established 17 per cent protected areas to protect nature and the environment,"" he stated. The prime minister's opinion comes at a time when Nepal has made significant progress in tiger conservation, which is being lauded by the international community. Chandramani Aryal, assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Padma Kanya Campus, said, ""The ecological carrying capacity of tiger habitat should be assessed through third-party monitoring. We must assess this."" He further said, ""The livelihoods of local people should be linked to conservation. The majority of the people who died were killed in the jungle while collecting firewood."" According to government statistics, the number of spotted tigers in Nepal was 121 in 2009, rising to 235 in 2018 and 355 by 2022. Referring to Nepal's 47 percent increase in forest area, Prime Minister Oli stated that the world should recognise and compensate Nepal for its contributions to nature conservation. Meanwhile, PM Oli's arguments contradict Sher Bahadur Deuba's decisions. When Deuba was the prime minister, the Council of Ministers made a decision related to the environment on October 28, 2021. In point 11, the Ministry of Forestry and Environment approved the 'Long-Term Zero Emission Strategy'. The Council of Ministers decided that forests should not be destroyed. Furthermore, the government passed the Second Determined Contribution in 2020, while Oli was prime minister. It was stated that 45 per cent of the forest is in Nepal and will be preserved until 2030. The government also approved a report that was submitted to the United Nations Climate Change Agency. The majority of the experts who responded to THT questions emphasised PM Oli's immaturity, which is reflected when the executive director speaks out against the decision after signing the treaty. Experts believe that failing to fulfil commitments to the international community demonstrates leadership incompetence. Aside from this, Nepal has signed several other international conventions on biological diversity. Moreover, in 1993, 165 countries, including Nepal, signed the report passed by the 1990 'Convention on Biological Diversity' conference in Brazil, which called on the world community to sign by 1992.","the, oli, tigers, tiger, cent, per, minister, prime, pm, experts, council, environment, diversity, biological, 150, sciences, habitat, conference, forest, sher"

She had just returned home after completing the programme, but the six-month suspension decisions shocked her, and she wrote, comparing the decision with the autocratic panchayat regime in Nepal on social media, ""The decision has been taken to suspend me for six months. It would have been preferable if the leaders who opposed the Panchayat had not emulated the Panchayat style."" In a dramatic development, CPN-UML took action against three members who opposed CPN-UML's decision. Yesterday, holding a central committee meeting, CPN-UML decided to expel its former vice chair Bhim Rawal and members Binda Pandey and Usha Kiran Timilsina for six months. The commonality among the three of them is that all had disagreed with the decision to build the party headquarters with the land worth billions of donations from the controversial businessman Min Bahadur Gurung, the owner of Bhatbhateni supermarket. UML then asked them for an explanation. Pandey and Timilsina submitted explanations, but Rawal didn't. UML said that action was taken against them after their answers were deemed 'unsatisfactory'. Following the UML decision, many have expressed signalling that dissenting voices are not welcome inside CPN-UML. Rawal termed the action against him as the result of Oli's autocratic, arbitrary, dictatorial mindset. Pandey took to Facebook to solicit suggestions, writing, ""We were working in the party and learnt that the leader had given us a six-month vacation. This period should be used constructively and creatively. Leave your suggestions."" Meanwhile, a debate has erupted among political observers and netizens over the CPN-UML's decision to relieve Rawal and suspend Pandey and Timilsina. Bharati Silwal Giri took to Facebook and wrote, ""It is a sad day that an honest and respected UML senior leader like Bhim Rawal has been ousted from the UML party, and dedicated cadres like Binda Pandey and Usha have been suspended for six months for opposing wrongdoing within the party."" ""Now Bimala Rai Poudel has objected to this. Will she also be punished?"" She questioned, adding, ""Such intolerance does not bode well for democracy!"" She also shared her previous post, saying, ""Sharing my Facebook post of 16 December. 2024, Oli, is trying to play monopoly! By stifling dissent in his party, he wants to establish his oligopoly. Which portends ill not only for UML but also for the country's harmony! Impressed by Xi Jinping's iron grip modus operandi."" The Himalayan Times interacted with experts, and they also responded something similar to Giri. ""Oli's modus operandi has always been so. The recent events are just a reminder of his persistent style,"" said political analyst Binay Mishra. ""He has always been a representative of non-progressive political ideology, even if his party is named after Marxism and Communism. He values monolithic, centralised, and parochial policies. His last tenure and move to dissolve the house are testimony to his anti-democratic credentials."" Political commentator Chandra Kishore also stated that Oli has a long history of crushing dissenting voices. For instance, Durga Prasai, Rabi Lamichhane, and, most recently, Bhim Rawal. ""What they all had in common was that Oli entertained them when they spoke his words. Similarly, Oli's tendency has always existed, and Oli has never liked opposing thoughts about himself. Look at their (Lamichhane, Prasai and Rawal present situation."" In an interesting twist, many people have questioned the ChatGPT about the CPN-UML's current decision, asking, ""What do you say to a political party that punishes a leader for raising questions when the leadership is wrong?"" ChatGPT response reads that ""A political party that punishes leaders who raise questions when leadership is wrong can be considered intolerant, undemocratic, and selfish. Such a party shows an inability to accept criticism, a lack of internal democracy, and a tendency to suppress the truth. This can create an atmosphere of fear within the party, which in the long run weakens the party and can lead to a loss of public confidence.""","uml, the, panchayat, decision, party, rawal, prasai, cpn, binda, modus, operandi, binay, political, chatgpt, tendency, kishore, lamichhane, bhim, december, mishra"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/icc-prosecutor-requests-arrest-warrants-for-the-head-of-myanmars-military-regime,ICC prosecutor requests arrest warrants for the head of Myanmar's military regime,Associated Press,2024-11-27 21:18:33,"THE HAGUE, NOVEMBER 27 The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor asked judges on Wednesday to issue an arrest warrant for the head of Myanmar's military regime for crimes committed against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who seized power from elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, is accused of crimes against humanity for the deportation and persecution of the Rohingya. Nearly a million people were forced into neighboring Bangladesh to escape what has been called an ethnic cleansing campaign involving mass rapes, killings and the torching of homes. From a refugee camp in Bangladesh, the court's top prosecutor, Karim Khan, said in a statement that he intended to request more warrants for Myanmar's leaders soon. ""In doing so, we will be demonstrating, together with all of our partners, that the Rohingya have not been forgotten. That they, like all people around the world, are entitled to the protection of the law,"" the British barrister said. The allegations stem from a counterinsurgency campaign that Myanmar's military began in August 2017 in response to an insurgent attack. Hlaing, who heads the Myanmar Defense Services, is said to have directed the armed forces of Myanmar, known as the Tatmadaw, as well as the national police to attack Rohingya civilians. Khan was in Bangladesh where he met with members of the displaced Rohingya population. About 1 million of the predominately Muslim Rohingya live in Bangladesh as refugees from Myanmar, including about 740,000 who fled in 2017. Rohingyas face widespread discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, with most denied citizenship. Myanmar's government refuses to recognize the Rohingya as one of the country's 135 lawful ethnic minorities, instead calling them Bengalis, with the implication that their native land is in Bangladesh and they are illegally settled in Myanmar. Human rights groups applauded the decision to seek a warrant. The dire situation of the Rohingya has received less attention as the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza have grabbed headlines. ""The ICC prosecutor's decision to seek a warrant against Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing comes amid renewed atrocities against Rohingya civilians that echo those suffered seven years ago. The ICC's action is an important step toward breaking the cycle of abuses and impunity,"" said Maria Elena Vignoli, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch. Zin Mar Aung, foreign minister for Myanmar's opposition National Unity Government, established by elected lawmakers barred from taking their seats in 2021, said on X that ICC judges should ""swiftly issue the warrant"" and that governments should ""act and enforce this warrant to uphold justice and international law."" She posted that the ICC action ""represents a critical moment in Myanmar history."" Myanmar's military regime issued a short statement, rejecting the proceedings, noting it was not party to the ICC and insisting the country's leadership practiced a policy of ""peaceful coexistence."" Khan's request now goes to a panel of three judges who will weigh the evidence provided and determine if a warrant should be issued. There is no deadline for a decision. A request for an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin took less than three weeks in 2023. However, warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas' military chief took more than six months to be issued. Rohingya refugees in sprawling camps in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district welcomed the news. ""We, all the Rohingyas, are very delighted, and I am personally very happy to hear about the application sent to the judges because the Myanmar military government has been torturing us for about 75 years, forcing us to leave our native land -Arakan,"" said Zahid Hossain, 53. Yahiya Khan, a 32-year-old human rights activist, also was optimistic: ""The military has been persecuting us for decades. Thousands of women were raped, thousands of people were killed, children were thrown to the burning fire by the brutal military regime. So, as a Rohingya, we are happy to hear that the chief (prosecutor) of the ICC requested the judges to issue arrest warrants."" Myanmar does not belong to the global court, but Bangladesh does. In 2018, judges at the court ruled the prosecutor could look into crimes that were ""completed"" on the territory of a member state, such as forcible deportation. In 2019, Khan's predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, formally requested to open an investigation into the situation and judges gave the green light for investigations into ""any crime, including any future crime"" committed at least partly in Bangladesh or another court member state and linked to the Rohingya. The move paved the way for Khan to pursue crimes beyond forcing men, women and children over the border and into refugee camps. The request comes days after a powerful rebel group seized a key trading town in northeastern Myanmar on the Chinese border, taking control of a lucrative rare earth mining hub in another setback for the military-led government. The military seized power from Aung San Suu Kyi's government in February 2021, triggering intensified fighting with long-established armed militias organized by Myanmar's ethnic minority groups in its border regions which have struggled for decades for more autonomy. In 2022, the International Court of Justice, the United Nations' highest court, advanced a separate case against Myanmar brought by Gambia alleging the Southeast Asian nation is responsible for genocide against the Rohingya. Five European countries and Canada have asked the court to back Gambia in the proceedings.","myanmar, rohingya, aung, the, court, prosecutor, military, warrant, hlaing, suu, kyi, icc, san, khan, judges, bazar, government, muslim, request, international"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/top-war-crimes-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-netanyahu-and-others-in-israel-hamas-fighting,Top war-crimes court issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu and others in Israel-Hamas fighting,Associated Press,2024-11-22 12:18:36,"THE HAGUE, NOVEMBER 22 The world's top war-crimes court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas' military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the 13-month war in Gaza. The warrants said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have used ""starvation as a method of warfare"" by restricting humanitarian aid and have intentionally targeted civilians in Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza - charges Israeli officials deny. The action by the International Criminal Court came as the death toll from Israel's campaign in Gaza passed 44,000 people, according to local health authorities, who say more than half of those killed were women and children. Their count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Experts say hunger has become widespread across Gaza and may have reached famine levels in the north of the territory, which is under siege by Israeli troops. Israel says it has been working hard to improve entry of aid, though the trickle of supplies into Gaza remains near the lowest levels of the war. Netanyahu condemned the warrant against him, saying Israel ""rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions"" by the court. In a statement released by his office, he said: ""There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza."" Gallant, in a statement, said the decision ""sets a dangerous precedent against the right to self-defense and moral warfare and encourages murderous terrorism."" The warrant marked the first time that a sitting leader of a major Western ally has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by a global court of justice. The decision turns Netanyahu and the others into internationally wanted suspects, putting them at risk of arrest when they travel abroad and potentially further isolating them. Israel and its top ally, the United States, are not members of the court. But others of Israel's allies, including some of its close European friends, are put in an awkward position. Several, including France, welcomed the court's decision and signaled they might arrest Netanyahu if he visited. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden's administration was ""deeply concerned by the prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision."" The warrants represent ""the most dramatic step yet in the court's involvement in the conflict between Israel and Hamas,"" said Anthony Dworkin, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Israeli leaders, politicians and officials across the spectrum denounced the warrants and the ICC. The new defense minister, Israel Katz, who replaced Gallant earlier this month, said Thursday's decision is ""a moral disgrace, entirely tainted by antisemitism, and drags the international judicial system to an unprecedented low."" Human rights groups applauded the move. The warrants against both sides ""break through the perception that certain individuals are beyond the reach of the law,"" the associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, Balkees Jarrah, said in a statement. The decision came six months after ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan requested the warrants. The court issued a warrant for Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas' armed wing, over the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that triggered Israel's offensive in Gaza. It said it found reasonable grounds to believe Deif was involved in murder, rape, torture and the taking of hostages amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity. In the Hamas-led attack, militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking some 250 others hostage. Around 100 Israelis remain captive in Gaza, around a third of them believed to be dead. Khan withdrew requests for warrants for two other senior Hamas figures, Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, who have both since been killed. Israel says it also killed Deif in an airstrike, but Hamas has never confirmed his death. The warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were issued by a three-judge panel in a unanimous decision. The panel said there were reasonable grounds to believe that both men bear responsibility for the war crime of starvation and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. The judges said the lack of food, water, electricity, fuel and specific medical supplies created conditions ""calculated to bring about the destruction of part of the civilian population in Gaza,"" including the deaths of children due to malnutrition and dehydration. They also found that by preventing hospital supplies and medicine from getting into Gaza, doctors were forced to operate, including performing amputations, without anesthesia or with unsafe means of sedation that led to ""great suffering."" Israeli diplomatic officials said the government is lobbying the international community to speak out against the warrants and is considering an appeal to the court. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal decision on how the government will proceed. Despite the warrants, none of the suspects is likely to face judges in The Hague anytime soon. Member countries are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. For example, Russian President Vladimir Putin, wanted on an ICC warrant for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, recently visited Mongolia, a member state in the court but also a Russian ally. He was not arrested. Still, the threat of arrest now complicates any travel abroad by Netanyahu and Gallant. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the warrants are binding on all 27 members countries of the European Union. France signaled it could arrest Netanyahu if he came to its territory. Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine called it a ""complex legal issue"" but said France supports the court's actions. ""Combating impunity is our priority,"" he said. ""Our response will align with these principles."" Hamas in a statement welcomed the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant but made no mention of the one against Deif. Israel's opposition leaders fiercely criticized the ICC's move. Benny Gantz, a retired general and political rival to Netanyahu, said it showed ""moral blindness"" and was a ""shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten."" Israel's campaign has caused heavy destruction across Gaza and driven almost the entire population of 2.3 million people from their homes, leaving most dependent on aid to survive. Two days after Hamas' attack on southern Israel, Gallant announced a total seal on Gaza, vowing not to let in food, fuel or other supplies. Under U.S. pressure, Israel began allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid to enter a few weeks later. Israel now says it puts no limit on the supplies permitted into Gaza, and it blames the U.N. distribution system. But Israel's official figures show the amount of aid it has let in has plunged since the beginning of October. The U.N has blamed Israeli military restrictions, along with widespread lawlessness that has led to theft of aid shipments. The case at the ICC is separate from another legal battle Israel is waging at the top U.N. court, the International Court of Justice, in which South Africa accuses Israel of genocide, an allegation Israeli leaders staunchly deny. Lawyers for Israel argued in court that the war in Gaza was a legitimate defense of its people and that it was Hamas militants who were guilty of genocide.","the, court, israel, hamas, israeli, crimes, decision, war, warrant, defense, prosecutor, warrants, supplies, hague, icc, ally, borrell, karine, josep, christophe"

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he has spoken three times with Donald Trump since Tuesday's election and they ""see eye-to-eye regarding the Iranian threat and all of its components."" Israeli President Isaac Herzog is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday. The Israeli airstrike in Lebanon killed at least 23 people, including seven children, in Aalmat village north of Beirut, far from the areas in the east and south where Hezbollah has a major presence. There was no Israeli evacuation warning. Israel's military said that it hit a Hezbollah site used to store weapons, and the strike was under review. Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza, in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas. Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations have led to all-out war. In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people, including nine women, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City. Israel's military said that it targeted a site where militants were operating, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike were under review. A separate strike hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense first responders who operate under the government. Israel strikes deeper into Lebanon Israel has struck deeper inside Lebanon since September, when it killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed more than 3,100 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel. After Israel's strike in Aalmat, around 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Beirut, legislator Raed Berro denied that any Hezbollah personnel or assets were in the building hit. ""Everyone can see, in front of cameras, that what is being pulled from under the rubble are women, children and elderly people who have nothing to do with weapons or rocket warehouses,"" Berro said. Hassan Ghaddaf, who lived next door and was slightly wounded while heading to his balcony with morning coffee, said displaced people were in the building. ""I had seen them and got to know them the other day,"" Ghaddaf said. ""They were peaceful. On the contrary, they had someone from the Lebanese Internal Security Forces that works for the state, and we saw their garb and clothes in the rubble."" In Syria, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab, and the Defense Ministry said that seven civilians were killed, state news agency SANA reported. Britain-based opposition war monitor The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights suggested that Hezbollah was targeted. Israel didn't immediately comment. Fears of famine in northern Gaza The mid-month deadline is approaching for the Biden administration's ultimatum for Israel: Allow more aid into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby northern Gaza towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Experts from a panel that monitors food security say famine is imminent or may already be happening. The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month war. Israel has sent forces back in, saying Hamas has regrouped. Israeli strikes often kill women and children. The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians. Also on Sunday, Israel's military released what it called footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show hooded detainees chained in stress positions. In some clips, men beat or poke them with batons. It wasn't possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said that it recovered during operations in Gaza. Rights groups have long accused the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent. Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate allegations of wrongdoing. The toll of war The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who don't distinguish between civilians and militants in their count, but say more than half the dead were women and children. Israeli bombardment and ground invasions have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands live in tent camps with few if any services. Cease-fire talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled, as have parallel efforts by the U.S. and others to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, said Saturday that it had suspended its efforts and would resume them when ""the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war."" Some Palestinians in Gaza responded with frustration. ""The Arab silence that controls the Arab capitals, that's because of the fear of the American administration and Israel,"" said Akram Jarada, displaced from Gaza City.","israeli, the, israel, war, hassan, people, around, strike, than, berro, fadel, raed, more, month, hezbollah, naim, isaac, palestinians, military, herzog"

In Lebanon, warplanes struck Beirut's southern suburbs on Tuesday after the military warned people to evacuate a number of homes. The new bombardment on both fronts comes on the verge of a deadline set by the United States for Israel to dramatically ramp up humanitarian aid allowed in Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. A group of eight international aid agencies said in a report on Tuesday that Israel has failed to meet the U.S. demands. In Lebanon, large explosions shook Beirut's southern suburbs - an area known as Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah has a significant presence - soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings for 11 houses there. There was no immediate word on casualties. The military said the houses contained Hezbollah installations, but the claim could not be independently confirmed. Late Monday night, a strike hit the village of Ain Yaacoub in northern Lebanon, killing at least 16 people, the Lebanese civil defense said. Four of the killed were Syrian refugees, and there were another 10 people wounded. There was no immediate Israeli military comment on the strike. Israel has been carrying out intensified bombardment of Lebanon since late September, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and put a stop to more than year of cross-border fire by the Lebanese militant group. Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 31 At the same time, Israel has continued its campaign in Gaza, now more than 13 months old, triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. An Israeli strike late Monday hit a makeshift cafeteria used by displaced people in Muwasi, the center of a ""humanitarian zone"" that Israel's military declared earlier in the war. At least 11 people were killed, including two children, according to officials at Nasser Hospital, where the casualties were taken. Video from the scene showed men pulling bloodied wounded from among tables and chairs set up in the sand in an enclosure made of corrugated metal sheets. In the southern city of Khan Younis, another 11 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a three-wheeled vehicle with a trailer known as a tuk-tuk, according to the Nasser Hospital. Tuk-tuks are widely used as taxis in Gaza. Another strike early Tuesday hit a house in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people including a woman, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The strike also wounded 11 others, it said. Another strike hit a group of people near a clinic run by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees in the central city of Deir al-Balah, killing at least six people, including two children, according to the city's Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strikes. Under US pressure, Israel allows more aid into Gaza Hours earlier, the Israeli military announced a small expansion of the humanitarian zone, where it has told Palestinians evacuating from other parts of Gaza to take refuge. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering in sprawling tent camps in and around Muwasi, a largely desolate area of dunes and agricultural fields with few facilities or services along the Mediterranean coast. Israeli forces have also been besieging the northernmost part of Gaza since the beginning of October, battling Hamas fighters it says regrouped there. With virtually no food or aid allowed in for more than a month, the siege has raised fears of famine among the tens of thousands of Palestinians believed to still be sheltering there. An Oct. 13 letter signed by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin gave Israeli 30 days to, among other things, allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods to enter Gaza each day. So far, Israel has fallen short. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, and 75 a day so far in November, according to Israel's official figures. The United Nations puts the number lower, at 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October. Israel has announced a flurry of measures in recent days to increase aid, including opening a new crossing into central Gaza. But so far the impact is unclear. The military said Tuesday it had allowed hundreds of packages of food and water into Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, two areas under siege in the far north of Gaza. The Palestinian civil defense agency said three trucks carrying flour, canned food and water reached Beit Hanoun. It was only the second delivery allowed into the area since the beginning of October; a smaller cargo was let in last week, though not all of it reached shelters in the north, according to the U.N. More forced evacuations in isolated northern Gaza The military announced Tuesday that four soldiers were killed in Jabaliya, bringing to 24 the number of soldiers killed in the assault there since it began. Palestinian health officials say hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, though the true numbers are unknown as rescue workers are unable to reach buildings destroyed in strikes. Israel has ordered residents in the area to evacuate. But the U.N. has estimated some 70,000 people remain. Many Palestinians there fear Israel aims to permanently depopulate the area to more easily keep control of it. On Tuesday, witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli troops had encircled at least three schools in Beit Hanoun, forcing hundreds of displaced people sheltering inside to leave. Drones blared announcements demanding people move south to Gaza City, said Mahmoud al-Kafarnah, speaking from one of the schools as sounds of gunfire could be heard. ""The tanks are outside,"" he said. ""We don't know where to go."" Hashim Afanah, sheltering with at least 20 other people in his family home, said the forces were evicting people from houses and shelters. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities that do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say more than half the dead are women and children. Israel says it targets Hamas militants who hide among civilians. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250 as hostages. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of them believed to be dead.","the, israeli, at, least, tuk, al, military, people, balah, strike, palestinians, gaza, hospital, israel, deir, trucks, more, humanitarian, defense, zone"

Sixteen people had initially been reported killed in two strikes on Thursday on the Gaza Strip's central Nuseirat refugee camp, but officials from the Al-Aqsa hospital said bodies continued to be brought in. Overall, the hospital said they had received 21 dead bodies from the strikes, including some transferred from the Awda hospital, where they had been brought the day before. One of the strikes killed an 18-month-old and his 10-year-old sister - the children's mother was missing as of Friday and the father was killed by an Israeli airstrike four months ago, the family told AP journalists at Aqsa hospital. Strikes on a motorcycle in Zuwaida and on a house in Deir al-Balah on Friday killed four more, the hospital officials said, bringing the overall toll to 25. The Israeli military told The Associated Press that it had hit a Hamas infrastructure site and a militant who was operating in the area of Nuseirat, but did not comment on the other strikes. It said it was aware of reports of civilian casualties and was investigating. Israel's blistering offensive on the Gaza Strip has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians since October 7, 2023, say health officials inside Gaza who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. They say more than half of the dead are women and children. The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Friday that a total of 55 people had been killed in the past 24 hours and that another 196 had been wounded. Israel began bombarding Gaza after the Hamas attack on Israel Oct. 7, when the militants killed roughly 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages back to Gaza. Despite growing pressure from the United States and others in the international community for a cease fire both in Gaza and Lebanon, Israel's air force pounded Beirut's southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight, destroying dozens of buildings in several neighborhoods, according to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency. The early Friday airstrikes on Dahiyeh - after a four-day lull during which no airstrikes were reported in the suburb - destroyed dozens of buildings and caused fires in the area, the agency said. In recent days, Israel has intensified its airstrikes on the northeastern city of Baalbek and nearby villages, as well as different parts of southern Lebanon. Early Friday, an Israeli airstrike on the edge of Qamatiyeh, southeast of Beirut, killed three people and wounded five, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. An Associated Press journalist who visited the scene said the strike was closer to the nearby village of Ein al-Rummaneh, adding that it caused minor damage to an apartment on the first floor of a building. Israel's military said in a statement that attacks ""in the area of Beirut"" had targeted Hezbollah weapons manufacturing sites, command centers and other infrastructure. Lebanon's Heath Ministry said more than 2,800 people have been killed and 13,000 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets almost daily into Israel, drawing retaliation. Jens Laerke of the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid, said there has also been a ""wave of displacement"" in recent days as tens of thousands of people have fled following warnings from Israel's military that attacks were imminent. Hezbollah has been firing thousands of rockets, drones and missiles into Israel - and drawing fierce Israeli retaliatory strikes - since Hamas' attack on Israel last year. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, Israel's regional adversary. On Thursday, four Thai workers and an Israeli farmer were killed in an agricultural area in Metula, Israel's northernmost town. The four were among seven people killed Thursday in a series of barrages fired at Israel from Lebanon. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Friday his ""personal and heartfelt condolences"" went out to the government of Thailand, the Thai people and the families of those killed. ""Hezbollah-Iranian terrorism knows no limits and harms Israelis and civilians from all over the world alike,"" he said in a statement. Cross border attacks from Hezbollah have killed 41 civilians and 30 soldiers in Israel so far, according to government figures.","the, gaza, israel, israeli, strip, strikes, lebanon, suburb, hospital, aqsa, al, hamas, airstrikes, deir, balah, agency, ministry, hezbollah, people, katz"

In a separate development, Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah said it has chosen Sheikh Naim Kassem to succeed longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month. Hezbollah vowed to continue with Nasrallah's policies ""until victory is achieved."" Meanwhile, eight Austrian soldiers serving in the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon were lightly injured in a missile strike at the Naqoura camp, Austrian authorities said. Defense Ministry spokesperson Michael Bauer wrote on social network X that the incident happened Tuesday lunchtime. He said it wasn't immediately clear who was responsible for the strike. None of the soldiers needed emergency treatment. Austrian Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner ""condemns this attack in the strongest terms and calls on all sides immediately to cease combat operations in the surroundings of the U.N. mission's positions,"" Bauer wrote. Israel also faced a backlash after passing legislation that could severely restrict the ability of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees to operate in the Palestinian territories. The agency, known as UNRWA, is the largest aid provider in Gaza. Israel has long accused it of militant ties, allegations it denies. A spokesperson for the U.N. children's agency said the decision ""means that a new way has been found to kill children."" Hezbollah's new leader has vowed to keep fighting Israel Hezbollah said in a statement that its decision-making Shura Council elected Kassem, who had been Nasrallah's deputy leader for over three decades, as the new secretary-general. Kassem, 71, a founding member of the militant group established following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, had been serving as acting leader. He has given several televised speeches vowing that Hezbollah will fight on despite a string of setbacks. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation, after Hamas' surprise attack out of Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered the war there. Iran, which backs both groups, has also directly traded fire with Israel, in April and then again this month. The tensions with Hezbollah boiled over in September, as Israel unleashed a wave of heavy airstrikes and killed Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon at the start of October. Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets into northern Israel on Tuesday, killing at least one person in the northern city of Maalot-Tarshiha, authorities said. Strike in northern Gaza comes as Israel wages a major operation there Even as attention has shifted to Lebanon and Iran in recent weeks, Israel has continued to wage a large operation in northern Gaza and to carry out airstrikes across the territory. Dr. Marwan al-Hams, director of the field hospitals' department at the Gaza Health Ministry, announced the toll from Tuesday's strike in the northern town of Beit Lahiya at a news conference. He said another 17 people are missing. The ministry's emergency service said at least 12 women and 20 children were among the dead, including babies. The dead included a mother and her five children, some of them adults, and a second mother with her six children, according to an initial casualty list provided by the emergency service. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been waging the operation in northern Gaza for more than three weeks, targeting what it says are pockets of Hamas militants who have regrouped there. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, said it was overwhelmed by the wave of wounded people from the strike. Israeli forces raided the medical facility over the weekend, detaining dozens of medics. The military said it detained scores of Hamas militants in the raid on Kamal Adwan, the latest in a series of raids on hospitals since the start of the war. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months, saying it carried out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tried to avoid harming civilians. The strikes have often killed women and children. Israel's latest major operation in northern Gaza, focused on the Jabaliya refugee camp, has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes in another wave of mass displacement more than a year into the war in the tiny coastal territory. On Tuesday, the military said four more soldiers were killed in the fighting in northern Gaza, bringing the toll since the start of the operation to 16, including a colonel. The military says it has killed dozens of militants, without providing evidence, while Hamas does not publicize its losses. Israeli laws targeting UN agency could further restrict aid Israel has also sharply restricted aid to the north this month, prompting a warning from the United States that failure to facilitate greater humanitarian assistance could lead to a reduction in military aid. Palestinians fear Israel is enacting a plan proposed by a group of former generals, who suggested the civilian population of the north should be ordered to evacuate, aid supplies should be cut off, and anyone remaining there should be considered a militant. The military has denied carrying out such a plan, while the government has not made a clear statement about it. On Monday, Israel's parliament passed two laws that ban UNRWA from operating on Israeli soil and cut all ties with the agency. Israel controls access to both Gaza and the occupied West Bank, and it was unclear how the agency would continue to operate there. Israel says UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas and that the militant group siphons off aid and uses U.N. facilities to shield its activities, allegations denied by the U.N. agency. Aid groups have warned that there is no immediate replacement for UNRWA, which provides education, health care and emergency aid to millions of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation and their descendants. Refugee families make up the majority of Gaza's population. James Elder, a spokesperson for the U.N. children's agency, known as UNICEF, said the suspension of UNRWA's work ""would likely see the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza."" He said UNICEF ""would become effectively unable to distribute lifesaving supplies."" He said that would impede deliveries of vaccines, winter clothes, hygiene kits, health kits, water, and ready-to-use therapeutic food to combat malnutrition. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities.

In northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging an air and ground campaign in Jabaliya for more than a week, residents said families were still trapped in their homes and shelters. It's been more than a year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 people captive inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. In solidarity with Hamas, Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has exchanged cross-border fire with Israel for the past year. Israel escalated its campaign against the group in recent weeks. Rumors circulated for weeks over head of the expeditionary arm of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard Gen. Esmail Qaani's status after an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut in late September. But Qaani, the head of the Quds Force, was seen in a black bomber jacket, wiping away tears at an event early Tuesday morning at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport.","gaza, esmail, mehrabad, qaani, israeli, revolutionary, nasrallah, hassan, strip, balah, hezbollah, guard, quds, bomber, strikes, jacket, tehran, 15, israel, people"

There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military and it was not clear what the target was. The strike hit a small apartment building in the village of Aito, which is part of the country's Christian heartland in the north and far from the Hezbollah militant group's main areas of influence in the south and east. Videos from Lebanese media showed a large plume of smoke rising from the hilly village, with several destroyed cars next to a severely damaged building, as people tried to remove bodies from beneath rubble and trees. The strike came a day after a Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in northern Israel killed four soldiers - all of them 19 years old - and severely wounded seven others in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant briefed his US counterpart Lloyd Austin on Monday on the deadly Hezbollah drone attack and vowed ""a forceful response"" by Israel. Sixty-one people were wounded in Sunday's attack. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel over the past year, killing more than 60 people, although most have been intercepted by Israel's air defense systems or hit open areas. In Lebanon, some 2,300 people have been killed by Israeli strikes since last October, more than three-quarters of the deaths occurring in the past month. Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, has vowed to keep up its attacks on Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza. Israel has said its campaign against Hezbollah is aimed at stopping those attacks so displaced Israelis can feel safe returning to their homes near the Lebanese border. A strike and an inferno in a Gaza hospital courtyard Earlier on Monday, an Israeli airstrike on a hospital courtyard in the Gaza Strip killed at least four people and triggered a fire that swept through a tent camp for people displaced by the war, leaving more than two dozen with severe burns. The Israeli military said the strike in Gaza targeted militants hiding out among civilians, without providing evidence. In recent months it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah was already struggling to treat a large number of wounded from an earlier strike on a school-turned-shelter that killed at least 20 people when the early morning airstrike hit and fire engulfed many of the tents. Several secondary explosions could be heard after the initial strike, but it was not immediately clear if they were caused by weapons or fuel tanks. Associated Press footage showed children among the wounded. A man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed hospital. Hospital records showed that four people were killed and 40 wounded. Twenty-five people were transferred to Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after suffering severe burns, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, while Palestinian militants abducted around 250 hostages. Around 100 are still being held inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. Around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war, often multiple times, and large areas of the coastal territory have been completely destroyed. Israeli rights groups warn of forced transfer in northern Gaza Israel has ordered the entire remaining population of the northern third of Gaza, estimated at around 400,000 people, to evacuate to the south and has not allowed any food to enter the north since the start of the month. Hundreds of thousands of people from the north heeded Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war and have not been allowed to return. That has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel intends to implement a plan devised by former generals in which it would order all civilians out of northern Gaza and label anyone remaining there a combatant - a surrender-or-starve strategy that rights groups say would violate international law. The plan has been presented to the Israeli government, but it's unclear whether it has been adopted. The military says it has not received such orders. Israeli rights groups on Monday called on the international community to prevent Israel from carrying out the plan, saying there are ""alarming signs"" that Israel is beginning to implement it. The statement, signed by B'Tselem, Gisha, Yesh Din and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, warned that states ""have an obligation to prevent the crimes of starvation and forcible transfer. On Monday, the Israeli military said it allowed 30 trucks carrying flour and food into north Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, said the trucks entered northern Gaza through the Erez crossing.","israeli, the, gaza, strike, people, hospital, israel, at, around, least, lebanese, airstrike, hezbollah, yoav, military, courtyard, gallant, than, northern, rights"

The Lebanon-based Hezbollah called the attack near Binyamina city retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. It later said it targeted Israel's elite Golani brigade, launching dozens of missiles to occupy Israeli air defense systems during the assault by ""squadrons"" of drones. Israel's national rescue service said the attack wounded 61. With Israel's advanced air-defense systems, it's rare for so many people to be injured by drones or missiles. Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire almost daily in the year since the war in Gaza began, and fighting has escalated. Israel launched its ground operation in Lebanon earlier this month with the goal of weakening Hezbollah and pushing the militant group away from the border to allow thousands of displaced Israelis to return to their homes. Inside Gaza, an Israeli airstrike killed at least 20 people including children at a school Sunday night, according to two local hospitals. The school in Nuseirat was sheltering some of the many Palestinians displaced by the war. Meanwhile, explosions hit early Monday outside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, killing three people and injuring about 50 others, the hospital said. Tents caught fire, and residents of the Central Gaza community carried the injured into the hospital. Hezbollah's deadly strike in Israel came the same day that the United States announced it would send a new air-defense system to Israel to help bolster protection against missiles, along with troops needed to operate it. An Israeli army spokesperson declined to provide a timeline. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon - both Iran-backed militant groups - and is expected to strike Iran in retaliation for a missile attack earlier this month. Iran has said it will respond to any Israeli attack. Netanyahu calls UN peacekeepers 'human shield' for Hezbollah The U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon known as UNIFIL said Israeli tanks forcibly entered the gates of one position early Sunday and destroyed the main gate. They later fired smoke rounds near peacekeepers, causing skin irritation. UNIFIL called the incident a ""further flagrant violation of international law."" International criticism is growing after Israeli forces have repeatedly fired on U.N. peacekeepers since the start of the ground operation in Lebanon. Five peacekeepers have been wounded in attacks that struck their positions, with most blamed on Israeli forces. Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, called Sunday's incident ""deeply worrying"" and said attacks against peacekeepers may constitute a war crime. Israel's military says Hezbollah operates in the peacekeepers' vicinity, without providing evidence. Military officials said a tank trying to evacuate wounded soldiers backed into a U.N. post Sunday while under fire. A smoke screen was used to provide cover, they said. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani asserted that Israel has tried to maintain constant contact with UNIFIL, and any instance of U.N. forces being harmed will be investigated at ""the highest level."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called for UNIFIL to heed Israel's warnings to evacuate, accusing them of ""providing a human shield"" to Hezbollah. ""We regret the injury to the UNIFIL soldiers, and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this injury. But the simple and obvious way to ensure this is simply to get them out of the danger zone,"" he said in a video addressed to the U.N. secretary-general, who has been banned from entering Israel. Israel has long accused the United Nations of being biased against it, and relations have plunged further since the start of the war in Gaza. Israeli strike in Lebanon destroys Ottoman-era market Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel a day after Hamas' surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. The conflict escalated in September with Israeli strikes that killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground operation earlier this month. More than 1,400 people have been killed in Lebanon since September, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were Hezbollah fighters. At least 58 people have been killed in rocket attacks on Israel, nearly half of them soldiers. Israeli airstrikes overnight destroyed an Ottoman-era market in Lebanon's southern city of Nabatiyeh, killing at least one person and wounding four. ""Our livelihoods have all been leveled,"" said Ahmad Fakih, whose shop was destroyed. Rescuers searched pancaked buildings as Israeli drones buzzed overhead. The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah targets, without elaborating, and said it continued to target the militants on Sunday. Separately, the Lebanese Red Cross said paramedics were searching for casualties in a house destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon when a second strike left four paramedics with concussions and damaged two ambulances. The Red Cross said the operation had been coordinated with U.N. peacekeepers, who informed the Israeli side. Bodies rot in the streets in northern Gaza Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets in Gaza almost daily. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas and other armed groups because they operate in densely populated areas. In northern Gaza, Israeli air and ground forces have been attacking Jabaliya, where the military says militants have regrouped. Over the past year, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to the built-up refugee camp, which dates to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, and other areas. Israel has ordered the full evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. An estimated 400,000 people remain in the north after a mass evacuation ordered in the war's opening weeks. Palestinians fear Israel intends to permanently depopulate the north to establish military bases or Jewish settlements there. The United Nations says no food has entered northern Gaza since Oct. 1. The military confirmed that hospitals were included in evacuation orders but said it had not set a timetable and was working with local authorities to facilitate patient transfers. Fares Abu Hamza, an official with the Gaza Health Ministry's emergency service, said the bodies of a ""large number of martyrs"" remain uncollected from the streets and under rubble. ""We are unable to reach them,"" he said, asserting that dogs are eating some remains. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked a year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still held in Gaza, a third believed to be dead. Israel's bombardment and its ground invasion of Gaza have killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and left much of the territory in ruins. The ministry doesn't distinguish between militants or civilians, but says women and children make up over half the deaths. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.","israeli, the, israel, hezbollah, gaza, peacekeepers, ministry, military, balah, lebanon, attack, soldiers, ground, people, at, least, war, operation, strike, deir"

Israel is still battling Hamas in Gaza nearly a year after its Oct. 7 attack, and has opened a new front against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has been trading fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel has also vowed to strike Iran itself after it launched a ballistic missile attack on the country last week. The widening conflict risks drawing in the United States, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel, as well as U.S.-allied Arab countries that host American forces. Iran-allied militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also joined in with long-distance strikes on Israel. Strikes across Gaza and new evacuation orders The strike in Gaza hit a mosque where displaced people were sheltering near the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. Israel said it targeted a Hamas command and control center embedded among civilians, without providing evidence. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men, while another man was wounded. The military meanwhile announced a new air and ground offensive in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, home to a densely populated refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. It circulated photos and video footage showing a column of tanks heading toward the area. The military said its forces had encircled Jabaliya as warplanes struck militant sides ahead of their advance. Over the course of the war, Israel has carried out several large operations there, only to see militants regroup. Israel also ordered new evacuations in northern Gaza, which largely emptied out in the early weeks of the war when Israel ordered its entire population to flee south. Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained there despite harsh conditions and heavy destruction. ""We are in a new phase of the war,"" the military said in leaflets dropped over the area. ""These areas are considered dangerous combat zones."" Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said it has expanded the so-called humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, urging people to head there. The zone includes sprawling tent camps where hundreds of thousands of people have already sought refuge, and Israel has carried out strikes inside it against what it says are fighters sheltering among civilians. Palestinian residents reported heavy Israeli strikes across northern Gaza. The Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government, said several homes and buildings had been hit and they were not able to reach them because of the bombardment. Many posted about the airstrikes and mourned their relatives on social media. Imad Alarabid said in a Facebook post that an airstrike on his home in Jabaliya killed a dozen of his family members, including his parents. Local journalists said one of their colleagues, Hassan Hamd, was killed in artillery shelling on his home in Jabaliya. He had worked as a freelance TV reporter and his footage had aired on Al Jazeera and other networks. Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter in northern Gaza, confirmed his death. The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is nearing 42,000, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack and took another 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Heavy bombardment of southern Beirut In Beirut, airstrikes lit up the skyline and loud explosions echoed across the southern suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, throughout the night, as Israel struck what it said were Hezbollah militants sites. The strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon's only international airport and another formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar. Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted. Hezbollah said it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers in northern Israel ""with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately."" It was not possible to confirm the claim. At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from its border so that tens of thousands of Israeli citizens can return to their homes. Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily. Last week, Israel launched what it said was a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top command. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters. It is not possible to verify battlefield reports from either side. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Damascus that ""we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon."" The minister said Middle Eastern and other countries had put forward initiatives, without elaborating. Araghchi spoke a day after the supreme leader of Iran praised its recent missile strikes on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary. On Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to these attacks, and it will do so."" On Lebanon, he said ""we are not done yet.""","israeli, the, al, hezbollah, strikes, palestinian, oct, hassan, military, hospital, hamas, bombardment, deir, balah, jazeera, manar, militant, war, gaza, attack"

Israeli planes also lit up the skyline across the southern suburbs of Beirut, striking what the military said were Hezbollah targets. The strike in Gaza hit a mosque where displaced people were sheltering near the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. Another four people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering displaced people near the town. The Israeli military said both strikes targeted militants, without providing evidence. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital morgue.

Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/israels-strikes-are-shifting-the-power-balance-in-the-middle-east-with-us-support,"Israel's strikes are shifting the power balance in the Middle East, with US support",Associated Press,2024-10-08 21:55:46,"WASHINGTON, OCTOBER 8 Israeli military strikes are targeting Iran's armed allies across a nearly 2,000-mile stretch of the Middle East and threatening Iran itself. The efforts raise the possibility of an end to two decades of Iranian ascendancy in the region, to which the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq inadvertently gave rise. In Washington, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and Arab capitals, opponents and supporters of Israel's offensive are offering clashing ideas about what the U.S. should do next, as its ally racks up tactical successes against Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen and presses its yearlong campaign to crush Hamas in Gaza. Israel should get all the support it needs from the United States until Iran's government ""follows other dictatorships of the past into the dustbin of history,"" said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at Washington's conservative-leaning Foundation for the Defense of Democracies - calls echoed by some Israeli political figures. Going further, Yoel Guzansky, a former senior staffer at Israel's National Security Council, called for the Biden administration to join Israel in direct attacks in Iran. That would send ""the right message to the Iranians - 'Don't mess with us,''' Guzansky said. Critics, however, highlight lessons from the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and toppling of Saddam Hussein, when President George W. Bush ignored Arab warnings that the Iraqi dictator was the region's indispensable counterbalance to Iranian influence. They caution against racking up military victories without adequately considering the risks, end goals or plans for what comes next, and warn of unintended consequences. Ultimately, Israel ""will be in a situation where it can only protect itself by perpetual war,"" said Vali Nasr, who was an adviser to the Obama administration. Now a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, or SAIS, he has been one of the leading documenters of the rise of Iranian regional influence since the U.S. invasion of Iraq. With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu giving limited weight to Biden administration calls for restraint, the United States and its partners in the Middle East are ""at the mercy of how far Bibi Netanyahu will push it,"" Nasr said, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname. ""It's as if we hadn't learned the lessons, or the folly, of that experiment ... in Iraq in 2003 about reshaping the Middle East order,"" said Randa Slim, a fellow at SAIS and researcher at the Washington-based Middle East Institute. Advocates of Israel's campaign hope for the weakening of Iran and its armed proxies that attack the U.S., Israel and their partners, oppress civil society and increasingly are teaming up with Russia and other Western adversaries. Opponents warn that military action without resolving the grievances of Palestinians and others risks endless and destabilizing cycles of war, insurgency and extremist violence, and Middle East governments growing more repressive to try to control the situation. And there's the threat that Iran develops nuclear weapons to try to ensure its survival. Before the Israeli strikes on Hezbollah, Iranian leaders concerned about Israel's offensives had made clear that they were interested in returning to negotiations with the U.S. on their nuclear program and claimed interest in improved relations overall. In just weeks, Israeli airstrikes and intelligence operations have devastated the leadership, ranks and arsenals of Lebanon-based Hezbollah - which had been one of the Middle East's most powerful fighting forces and Iran's overseas bulwark against attacks on Iranian territory - and hit oil infrastructure of Yemen's Iran-allied Houthis. A year of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza appears to have reduced the leadership of Iranian-allied Hamas to a few survivors hiding in underground tunnels. However, Israeli forces again engaged in heavy fighting there this week, and Hamas was able to fire rockets at Tel Aviv in a surprising show of enduring strength on the Oct. 7 anniversary of the militant group's attack on Israel, which started the war. Anticipated Israeli counterstrikes on Iran could accelerate regional shifts in power. The response would follow Iran launching ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for killings of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. It also could escalate the risk of all-out regional war that U.S. President Joe Biden - and decades of previous administrations - worked to avert. The expansion of Israeli attacks since late last month has sidelined mediation by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar for a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. U.S. leaders say Israel did not warn them before striking Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon but have defended the surge in attacks, while still pressing for peace. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired Monday that the U.S. was dedicated to supplying Israel with the military aid needed to protect itself but would keep pushing to end the conflict. ""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,"" she said. Israel's expanded strikes raise for many what is the tempting prospect of weakening Iran's anti-Western, anti-Israel alliance with like-minded armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen to governments in Russia and North Korea. Called the ""Axis of Resistance,"" Iran's military alliances grew - regionally, then globally - after the U.S. invasion of Iraq removed Saddam, who had fought an eight-year war against Iran's ambitious clerical regime. Advocates of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and overthrow of Saddam, said correctly that an Iraqi democracy would take hold. But the unintended effects of the U.S. intervention were even bigger, including the rise of Iran's Axis of Resistance and new extremist groups, including the Islamic State. ""An emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor"" of the 2003 Iraq war, notes a U.S. Army review of lessons learned. ""Two decades ago, who could have seen a day when Iran was supporting Russia with arms? The reason is because of its increased influence"" after the U.S. overthrow of Saddam, said Ihsan Alshimary, professor of political science at Baghdad University. Even more than in 2003, global leaders are offering little clear idea on how the shifts in power that Israel's military is putting in motion will end - for Iran, Israel, the Middle East at large, and the United States. Iran and its allies are being weakened, said Goldberg, at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. So is U.S. influence as it appears to be dragged along by Israel, Nasr said. The conflict could end up hurting Israel if it bogs down in a ground war in Lebanon, for example, said Mehran Kamrava, a professor and Middle East expert at Georgetown University in Qatar. After four decades of deep animosity between Israeli and Iranian leaders, ""the cold war between them has turned into a hot war. And this is significantly changing - is bound to change - the strategic landscape in the Middle East,"" he said. ""We are certainly at the precipice of change,"" Kamrava said. But ""the direction and nature of that change is very hard to predict at this stage.""","the, israeli, iran, iranian, israel, east, middle, war, axis, military, leaders, strikes, biden, influence, washington, guzansky, iraqi, yoel, hopkins, johns"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/unleashing-the-power-of-alumni-to-improve-nepals-education-system,Unleashing the power of alumni: To improve Nepal's education system,Prakriti Thapa,2024-09-20 10:59:07,"Nepal's education sector has witnessed remarkable growth since the democratic transition in the 1990s, with increasing student enrollment numbers. According to the National Examination Board (NEB), 464,785 students appeared in the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) in the most recent academic year. The trend continues into higher education, with 385,236 students sitting for the grade 12 board exams. The University Grants Commission (UGC) reports that 422,915 students are currently pursuing various programmes across the country's 11 universities. Each year, a significant number of these students graduate with bachelor's and master's degrees, joining the ranks of their respective alma maters' alumni. This burgeoning population of graduates represents an immense, yet largely untapped, resource for Nepal's educational institutions. While these students may not be in a position to support their alma maters immediately after graduation, their potential for contribution grows significantly over time. However, our recent research shows that a critical piece of the puzzle is missing, that is, a systematic engagement and utilisation of alumni networks to enhance the quality and sustainability of Nepal's education system. Despite the vast number of graduates produced annually, many institutions lack structured mechanisms to maintain connections with their alumni and harness their potential contributions. According to a survey we conducted through the Nexus Institute of Research and Innovation (NIRI), Nepal, which sampled 44 schools and colleges in the Kathmandu Valley, only 24 have established alumni associations. Of these 24 associations, only 14 are currently active, indicating a high rate of dormancy or ineffectiveness among existing alumni networks. Nine of the sampled institutions fail to recognize the importance of alumni associations altogether. This statistic underscores a profound lack of awareness about the potential impact of engaged alumni on institutional development and educational quality. The research also revealed that two of the sampled associations have been supporting students' education though scholarship programmes. Furthermore, 12 other active associations are contributing in diverse, non-monetary ways that span from supporting orientation programmes, upgrading libraries to facilitating job placements. These positive examples, however, stand in stark contrast to the overall landscape of alumni engagement in Nepal's education sector despite the fact that the culture of giving is deeply ingrained in Nepali society, manifesting in various social and religious contexts. The concept of alumni philanthropy has deep historical roots, tracing back to 1648 when Harvard College alumni donated land to their alma mater. This act of generosity sparked a global movement that has since transformed the landscape of higher education funding and engagement. In 2020, this tradition reached new heights, with elite American institutions collecting large endowments from various contributors, including their alumni. Harvard University led the pack with a remarkable $40.8 billion, followed closely by Yale ($30.3 billion), Stanford ($26.5 billion) and Princeton ($26.1 billion). In neighbouring India, prestigious institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) in Bombay and Kanpur have successfully cultivated active and generous alumni networks, demonstrating the potential for such engagement in South Asian contexts. Nepal's journey with alumni associations is very recent. The pioneer in this field was St. Xavier's School in Lalitpur, establishing the country's first alumni association in 1964. Budhanilkantha and St. Mary's School followed suit in 1982 and 1998, respectively. Their success stories offer valuable insights into the potential of well-organised alumni networks in Nepal. Kamal Keshari Tuladhar, past president of ASMAN (Association of St. Mary's Alumnae Nepal), sheds light on the challenges hindering widespread alumni engagement in Nepal. She identifies key issues, such as the lack of proactive outreach from schools to their former students and the absence of initiatives to maintain connections. She says students harbour fond memories and have a soft spot for their alma maters, presenting a unique opportunity for schools to nurture these sentiments into lasting bonds. She suggests the schools should leverage modern communication tools, such as email, to maintain regular contact with their alumni. Additionally, she recommends inviting former students to school functions and events, creating opportunities for meaningful engagement and fostering a sense of continued belonging. Tilak Bhusal, a Pulchowk Campus graduate, currently pursuing a Master's degree in the USA, aspires to enhance the research opportunities in Nepal after completing his studies. Bhusal's aspiration reflects a broader trend among Nepali students studying abroad. The key challenge lies in creating avenues for these accomplished individuals to meaningfully contribute to their alma maters and Nepal's education sector upon their return. Similarly, Santosh Bisht, President of the Society of Ex-Budhanilkantha Students (SEBS), suggested personalised outreach, simplification of the donation process, utilising influential alumni to reach out to their peers, and ensuring transparency on the use of donation and tax benefits on charity. For Nepal to fully realise the potential of its growing alumni population, educational institutions must prioritise the establishment and activation of alumni associations. This requires not only raising awareness about the importance of alumni networks, but also implementing practical strategies to maintain connections with former students. By leveraging the deep-seated culture of giving in Nepali society and aligning it with educational needs, schools and universities can secure the long-term support necessary for sustained growth and improvement. Likewise, the concerned authorities like the UGC and NEB should take decisive action to unleash the power of alumni associations. This means developing policies that encourage the formation and activation of these networks, providing training and resources to institutions on alumni engagement, and fostering a culture of giving back among graduates. By doing so, Nepal can unlock a wealth of resources that have the potential to transform its education sector, bridging the gap between the aspirations of its students and the quality of education they receive.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/david-vs-goliath-the-epistemological-challenge-and-the-myth-of-strategy,David Vs. Goliath: The epistemological challenge and the myth of strategy,"Nischaya Subedi, Sumit Pathak",2024-09-05 11:06:50,"The pursuit of human knowledge is inherently retrospective. On a macro scale, our understanding of the universe begins with the Big Bang, the most credible theory of its origin. At the micro level, quantum physics dictates that we can only determine the outcome of an experiment after making measurements. Given that two of our most established and successful scientific theories highlight the retrospective nature of the universe, is it possible to formulate a strategy for future success? In today's world, ""strategy"" is a term often misused and misunderstood, especially in the business world. Its incorrect application is widespread and not limited to management. Despite this, we want to explore the concept of strategy through the lens of a timeless myth: David versus Goliath. The underdog triumphing over the giant is a universally appealing narrative, but what psychological factors drive this fascination? What strategic lessons can we derive from this ancient tale that are relevant to today's world? For the purpose of this article, we'll define strategy as a course of action designed to achieve a specific ""winning"" goal, whether short-term or long-term. Strategies typically involve identifying challenges, assessing opponents and leveraging strengths and weaknesses. This adversarial framework is evident in how the media often portrays conflicts: Harris vs. Trump, Apple vs. Google, Democrats vs. Republicans, China vs. the USA, and so on. Returning to the David versus Goliath story, we can identify both strengths and weaknesses for each combatant. David, the young shepherd, demonstrated bravery in facing the formidable Goliath. However, his inexperience in combat and small stature were clear disadvantages. Conversely, Goliath was renowned for his immense strength, combat experience and courage. Logically, one might assume Goliath's overwhelming advantages would guarantee victory. Yet, the narrative unfolds differently. David's unconventional tactics, using a sling and a stone, exploited Goliath's overconfidence and vulnerability. In a single, decisive moment, David's agility and precision transformed him from underdog to victor. This iconic tale continues to inspire those facing seemingly insurmountable challenges. However, a closer examination of the story reveals a strategic shift: David's perceived weaknesses vanished, replaced by newfound strengths, while Goliath's invincibility crumbled. The classic roles reversed-David became the Goliath, and Goliath became the David. Considering the nature of such events, one might speculate that their origins lie in conditions preceding the Big Bang or the state of the universe after an experiment. This perspective, while speculative and potentially absurd to those who prioritise human free will, is prompted by the frequent occurrence of seemingly predetermined or probabilistic outcomes throughout history. These unexpected events challenge the conventional notion that strategy, as understood by the mainstream, alone shapes events. For example, Kamala Harris, the vice president of the United States with a unique background as a Black and Indian-American, has made significant strides in pre-election polls against her formidable opponent, Donald Trump. A year ago, her approval rating as vice president was dismal. This unexpected surge in her popularity and poll numbers mirrors the classic David versus Goliath narrative. Last month, Sheikh Hasina, a longstanding figure in Bangladesh's political leadership, was forced to flee the country due to widespread unrest led by students and civilians-individuals she likely underestimated as David, viewing them as a predictable opposition with known strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, OpenAI and ChatGPT were once the subjects of ridicule until they unexpectedly emerged as a serious threat to Google's three decades of dominance-the Goliath that no one saw coming. David versus Goliath stories have been a constant in the business world as well. A prime example is Apple's resurgence from obscurity in the 2000s. Its revolutionary iPhone, termed the ""Jesus phone"", featured a touchscreen that completely disrupted the market and dethroned the Finnish giant, Nokia. Countless examples of underdogs triumphing in sports, politics, entertainment and life could be cited. While we often attribute their success to sheer determination, the reality is that many superhuman efforts fall short. Data reveals that less than 5 per cent of startups become the next Facebook. This raises the question: should we rely solely on determinism or consider the role of probability in our strategies? Certainly not one or the other. We suggest that the possibility of a David defeating Goliath exists at any moment, and being aware of this potential is essential. We can call this awareness determinism, probability, a ""glitch in the matrix"", divine intervention, or the ultimate strategy.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/dabbling-in-diplomacy-in-asia-the-focal-point-of-the-world,Dabbling in diplomacy in Asia: The focal point of the world,Hisila Yami,2024-08-27 13:36:20,"S.D. Muni's book 'Dabbling in Diplomacy', otherwise a very specialised book but written lucidly with his life intertwined with teaching, research and diplomacy combined with brushings with politicians and revolution, is interesting to read. What makes this book relevant for this region, in general, and Nepal, in particular, is that today the focus of the world is on the fast growing economies of China and India. And Nepal is sandwiched between the two. Reading the introductory chapter on his upbringing and struggle to reach where he is today, is particularly interesting. The similarity in the upbringing of both S.D. Muni (SDM), the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) professor-turned ex-diplomat, and Baburam Bhattarai (BRB), the JNU student-turned former Prime Minister of Nepal, is striking. Both came from a lower middle class family away from the power centres, Delhi and Kathmandu. Both reached the capital on their meritocracy, and both were supporting their family members with the stipend they received. Both married fellow students studying the same subjects while living in hostels. And both have faced accusations by politicians in their respective countries. The only difference is that BRB as an ideologue and a politician was trying to create a revolution and did so in Nepal despite all odds. And SDM was a restless professor in JNU dabbling not only in diplomacy but also with the minds of politicians of the region, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Laos. And because he was intruding into the minds of politicians, he was always at odds with the rigid bureaucracy of his own country. The second and third chapters on Nepal, spanning from the 1960s to the 2010s, makes for an interesting read on the dynamics of political upheavals in this country. Within 50 years, Nepal went from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional multiparty system to again an absolute monarchy and now a Federal Democratic Republic. No wonder Muni loves to keep track of what is happening in Nepal. I once asked him about the many ups and downs in India-Nepal relations, to which he said: 'Too close to be comfortable'. His engagement with the embassies, media people, politicians, security personnel and bureaucrats to get his views heard makes interesting reading. No wonder, in the conclusion, he points out: at the end of the day, what one learns through textbooks and classroom teaching is different from practice. Elaborating on it he says, foreign policy decisions have three layers: i) the things thought, ii) the things said and iii) the things done. Intelligence lies in observing each part and in sequences and ultimately in a package. Regarding the Maoist movement, he was a keen observer of political events in Nepal and an advocator of the monarchy's abolition (without violence) and a stable Nepal (by mainstreaming the Maoists). After reading the two chapters on Nepal, I could not help remembering him on three occasions. Before the People's War started, we landed in his house when BRB, myself and a Nepali Sanskrit student had run into trouble within the JNU compound past mid-night after three local goons tried to kidnap me with sexual intentions. Somehow we miraculously escaped the attack, and the nearest building was Muni's residential flat. As the students' dean, we took shelter there for a few hours before the police arrived. During the people's war, I fondly remember him giving me some practical advice: 'Hisila, power is a means to practise your ideology', which I kept repeating to my ideology-oriented husband, BRB. After the war and after we had left the Maoist Party, he again nudged me: 'Tell BRB not to leave the Maoist Party, stay and fight from within.' The fourth chapter on Sri Lanka made me all the more curious. Just when the people's war in Nepal was at its peak (2001-5), he was narrating to us the LTTE activities in Sri Lanka and how the Indian establishment was getting entangled in it. I realised how different our war was operating in comparison to the LTTE movement in Sri Lanka. The LTTE was annihilating politicians who differed from them to the extent that they even tried to kill Chandrika Kumaratunga, who later on became the president of the country. The LTTE killed Rajib Gandhi in his own country. In Nepal's context, we were interacting with the political parties against the king. We were also in touch with international forces, including India. While the LTTE was sending women cadres as suicide bombers under the political banner 'liberation and death', in Nepal the Maoists were organising women cadres under the banner 'liberation or death' by politically motivating them to fight the security personnel. Having read on conflicts in Nepal and Sri Lanka, the next chapter on Laos and SDM's ambassadorial tenure in that country reads like a touristic journey to the East Asian country. One wonders why Muni chose to go to Laos instead of Sri Lanka where his rich research, political acumen and critical judgement would have been more helpful to himself and the country he would represent. Similarly there is a contradiction in his aspiration to see Nepal as a New Nepal and desire to mainstream the Maoists in the old ways at a time when the Maoists were advocating transformative politics then. On the same note, he is silent on the Maoist movement in India. Lastly, let me end by again coming back to BRB and SDM: while both had almost the same upbringing, both stood to their guns. While SDM remained faithful to India's foreign policy, regardless of how he defends himself as an independent and critical researcher, BRB remained faithful to his transformative politics and core interest of Nepal, no matter how he has played with power politics. And the dilemma BRB suffers from is that he is slandered by the monarchists as a pro-India element in Nepal while SDM is accused of being pro-Maoist by his detractors in India!","the, ltte, muni, upbringing, chapter, war, his, sdm, jnu, maoist, chapters, banner, liberation, book, ideology, political, country, politics, monarchy, india"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/ukraine-gambled-on-an-incursion-deep-into-russian-territory-the-bold-move-changed-the-battlefield,Ukraine gambled on an incursion deep into Russian territory. The bold move changed the battlefield,Associated Press,2024-08-15 21:01:37,"KYIV, AUGUST 15 Ukraine's stunning incursion into Russia's Kursk border region was a bold gamble for the country's military commanders, who committed their limited resources to a risky assault on a nuclear-armed enemy with no assurance of success. After the first signs of progress, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy broke his silence and spelled out Kyiv's daily advances to his war-weary public. By Wednesday, Ukrainian officials said they controlled 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of enemy territory, including at least 74 settlements and hundreds of Russian prisoners of war. But a week after it began, the overall aim of the daring operation is still unclear: Will Ukraine dig in and keep the conquered territory, advance further into Russian territory or pull back? What is clear is that the incursion has changed the battlefield. The shock of Ukraine's thunder run revealed chinks in the armor of its powerful adversary. The attack also risked aggravating Ukraine's own weaknesses by extending the front line and committing new troops at a time when military leaders are short on manpower. To conduct the Kursk operation, Kyiv deployed battalions drawn from multiple brigades, some of which were pulled from the hottest parts of the front line, where Russia's advance has continued unabated. So far, Moscow's overall strategic advantage is intact. ""The stretching of the front line for us is also stretching the front line for the enemy,"" said the commander of the 14th Regiment of Unmanned Aviation Systems, who participated in the opening stage of the offensive. ""Only we have prepared for this operation in detail. The Russians were not prepared for this operation at all."" He spoke on condition of anonymity, using only the call sign Charlie, in keeping with the rules of the Ukrainian military. As the offensive enters its second week, Ukrainian forces are pushing out in several directions from the Russian town of Sudzha. Images from the battlefield showing columns of destroyed Russian weaponry are reminiscent of Ukraine's successful counteroffensives in 2022 in Kherson and Kharkiv. The photos are also a boon to national morale that deflated after the failed 2023 summer counteroffensive and months of recent territorial losses in the east. But some analysts are reserving judgment on whether the Kursk region is the right theater to launch an offensive. Estimates of the number of troops operating there range from 5,000 to 12,000. Within a week, Ukraine claimed to have captured almost as much Russian land in Kursk as Russian forces took in Ukraine in the last seven months, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Russian authorities acknowledged the Ukrainian gains but described them as smaller. Even so, they have evacuated about 132,000 people. Hundreds of Russian prisoners were blindfolded and ferried away in trucks in the opening moments of the lightning advance. They could be used in future prisoner swaps to free thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians in captivity. On Wednesday, Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said the fighting in Kursk led his Russian counterpart, Tatyana Moskalkova, to initiate a conversation about prisoner swaps, the first time such a request has come from Moscow. Politically, the incursion turned the tables on Russia and reset the terms of a conflict in which Ukraine increasingly seemed doomed to accept unfavorable cease-fire terms. The strike was also a powerful example of Ukrainian determination and a message to Western allies that have dithered on allowing donated weapons to be used for deeper strikes inside Russian territory. The assault has shown that the fear of crossing Russian ""red lines"" that could lead to nuclear escalation ""is a myth, and that Ukraine's battle-hardened military remains a formidable force,"" wrote Taras Kuzio, a professor of political science at the National University Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak suggested that the incursion may also strengthen Kyiv's hand in future negotiations with Russia. Occupying part of Russian territory ahead of any cease-fire talks may give Ukraine some leverage. Though the fighting continues, the territory currently under Ukrainian control is, by itself, of little economic or strategic value. ""There is some important gas infrastructure in the area, but its usefulness is likely to be limited other than as a minor bargaining chip. Ukrainians have also cut a railway line running from Lgov to Belgorod,"" said Pasi Paroinen of the Black Bird Group, a Finland-based open-source intelligence agency that monitors the war. Major military bases are far from the current area of operations, and Ukrainian advances are expected to slow as Russia sends in more forces. Ukrainian officials have said they do not intend to occupy Kursk, but they may seek to create a buffer zone to protect settlements in the bordering Sumy region from relentless Russian artillery attacks and to block supply lines to the northeast. Forcing Russia to deploy reserves intended for other parts of the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line was the minimum aim, said Charlie, the commander. But so far, Moscow's focus in the Donetsk region has not changed. Some Ukrainian troops were pulled from those very lines, where manpower shortages were a key factor that contributed to territorial losses this year. In the strategically significant Pokrovsk area, which is the main thrust of Russia's offensive effort, soldiers have seen few improvements since the Kursk incursion. ""Nothing has changed,"" said a soldier known by the call sign Kyianyn, who also spoke on condition of anonymity due to military protocol. ""If anything, I see the increase in Russian offensive actions."" But the Kursk operation ""showed they can't defend their own territory,"" he said. ""All of us are inspired here. Many of our soldiers wanted to go to Kursk and push them straight to the Kremlin."" Targeting Russia's Northern Grouping of Forces, which feeds the Kharkiv front, is a key goal, said Konstantin Mashovets, a Ukrainian military expert. Some Russian units have reportedly moved from Vovchansk in Kharkiv. In the south, a small number of Russian units were redeployed from the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, said Dmytro Lykhovii, the spokesman of the Tavria operational group. But that hasn't affected Russian attacks. ""We even see an increase in (Russian) activity,"" Lykhovii said. The Kursk operation has also served to draw attention away from the eastern front, where tens of thousands of Ukrainians have been killed and wounded, and where the Ukrainian military has struggled to repair cracks in its defenses. Most territorial losses in June and July were recorded in the Pokrovsk area, which is near a logistics hub, with fighting intensifying near the towns of Toretsk and Chasiv Yar. Russian forces dialed up those attacks to capitalize on troop fatigue and shortages. On many occasions, the losses were the result of poorly timed troop rotations and blunders that cast doubt about the overall strategy of the Ukrainian military's General Staff. ""There is no way Russia will stop its actions in the parts of the front line where they are tactically succeeding,"" Mashovets said. ""There, they will push and squeeze until their last man is standing, no matter what."" But the push into Kursk might force the Kremlin to pull reserves ""from the parts of the front line that are of secondary importance.""","the, russian, ukrainian, kursk, military, kyiv, incursion, dmytro, territory, pokrovsk, ukraine, offensive, forces, enemy, 000, operation, lines, swaps, losses, russia"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/health/a-new-global-health-emergency-what-is-mpox-where-are-the-outbreaks-and-will-the-virus-spread,"A new global health emergency: What is mpox, where are the outbreaks and will the virus spread?",Associated Press,2024-08-15 20:42:22,"LONDON, AUGUST 15 The World Health Organization declared Wednesday that the increasing spread of mpox in Africa is a global health emergency, warning the virus might ultimately spill across international borders. The announcement by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus came after a meeting of the U.N. health agency's emergency committee. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared mpox a public health emergency on the continent on Tuesday. WHO said there have been more than 14,000 cases and 524 deaths in Africa this year, which already exceed last year's figures. So far, more than 96% of all cases and deaths are in a single country - Congo. Scientists are concerned by the spread of a new version of the disease there that might be more easily transmitted among people. Here's a look at what we know about mpox, and what might be done to contain it: What is mpox? Mpox, also known as monkeypox, was first identified by scientists in 1958 when there were outbreaks of a ""pox-like"" disease in monkeys. Until recently, most human cases were seen in people in central and West Africa who had close contact with infected animals. In 2022, the virus was confirmed to spread via sex for the first time and triggered outbreaks in more than 70 countries across the world that had not previously reported mpox. Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox but causes milder symptoms like fever, chills and body aches. People with more serious cases can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals. What's happening in Africa that's causing all this concern? The number of cases has jumped dramatically. Last week, the Africa CDC reported that mpox has now been detected in at least 13 African countries. Compared with the same period last year, the agency said cases are up 160% and deaths have increased by 19%. Earlier this year, scientists reported the emergence of a new form of mpox in a Congolese mining town that can kill up to 10% of people and may spread more easily. Unlike in previous mpox outbreaks, where lesions were mostly seen on the chest, hands and feet, the new form of mpox causes milder symptoms and lesions on the genitals. That makes it harder to spot, meaning people might also sicken others without knowing they're infected, said Dr. Placide Mbala-Kingebeni, a Congolese researcher who led the research into the new form of mpox. WHO said mpox was recently identified for the first time in four East African countries: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. All of those outbreaks were linked to the epidemic in Congo. Tedros said there was concern for the further spread of the disease within Africa and beyond. In the Ivory Coast and South Africa, health authorities have reported outbreaks of a different and less dangerous version of mpox that spread worldwide in 2022. What's the threat to the rest of the world? Like any infectious disease, the new form of mpox seen in Congo could cross borders - cases have already been identified in four other East African countries. Kamituga, the region in Congo where the new form of mpox was first spotted, is home to a significant transient population traveling through Africa and beyond. Still, given the resources in rich countries to stop mpox, scientists suspect that if new outbreaks linked to Congo were to be identified, transmission could be stopped relatively quickly. Unlike COVID-19 or measles, mpox is not airborne and typically requires close, skin-to-skin contact to spread. What does an emergency declaration mean? WHO's emergency declaration is meant to spur donor agencies and countries into action. But the global response to previous declarations has been mixed. Africa CDC Director General Dr. Jean Kaseya said the agency's declaration of a public health emergency was meant ""to mobilize our institutions, our collective will and our resources to act swiftly and decisively."" He appealed to Africa's international partners for help, saying that the escalating caseload in Africa had largely been ignored. Dr. Boghuma Titanji, an infectious diseases expert at Emory University, said the last WHO emergency declaration for mpox ""did very little to move the needle"" on getting things like diagnostic tests, medicines and vaccines to Africa. What's different about the current outbreak in Africa compared to the 2022 epidemic? During the global outbreak of mpox in 2022, gay and bisexual men made up the vast majority of cases and the virus was mostly spread through close contact, including sex. Although some similar patterns have been seen in Africa, children under 15 now account for more than 70% of the mpox cases and 85% of deaths in Congo. Greg Ramm, Save the Children's Congo director, said the organization was particularly worried about the spread of mpox in the crowded camps for refugees in the east, noting there were 345,000 children ""crammed into tents in unsanitary conditions."" He said the country's health system was already ""collapsing"" under the strain of malnutrition, measles and cholera. Emory's Titanji said it was unclear why children were so disproportionately hit by mpox in Congo. She said it might be because kids are more susceptible to the virus or that social factors, like overcrowding and exposure to parents who caught the disease, might explain it. How might mpox be stopped? The 2022 outbreak of mpox in dozens of countries was largely shut down with the use of vaccines and treatments in rich countries, in addition to convincing people to avoid risky behavior. But barely any vaccines or treatments have been available in Africa. Marks, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that immunization would likely help - including inoculating people against smallpox, a related virus. ""We need a large supply of vaccine so that we can vaccinate populations most at risk,"" he said, adding that would mean sex workers, children and adults living in outbreak regions. Congolese authorities have asked for 4 million doses mostly for young children , but no doses have yet been received, said Cris Kacita Osako, coordinator of Congo's Monkeypox Response Committee.","the, africa, emergency, disease, outbreaks, cases, outbreak, health, monkeypox, titanji, african, congolese, mpox, declaration, congo, spread, children, doses, boghuma, cdc"

Jefferson Lerma scored in the 39th minute for a 1-0 win Wednesday night and a matchup with Lionel Messi and defending champion Argentina on Sunday. ""Until you overcome your weaknesses you cannot grow,"" Colombia coach Nester Lorenzo said through a interpreter. ""And when you overcome those obstacles you can grow."" Daniel Muñoz was ejected in first-half stoppage time for an elbow that led to his second yellow card. Despite Uruguay having 61.9% possession, Colombia held on to reach the championship for the first time since winning its only Copa title as host in 2001. Colombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than from 1992-94 and the longest current streak in men's international soccer. ""They are very hungry as players and very eager and they really add many elements to their game beyond the tactical side,"" Lorenzo said. In a match that included seven yellow cards in addition to the red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle. Darwin Núñez and about a dozen Uruguay teammates went into the stands as fans brawled. A video showed Núñez hitting a fan in Colombian team colors. CONMEBOL released a statement after the game saying that it strongly condemns any act of violence that affects the game. ""Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values,"" the organization said. ""There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field. We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all of their passion into cheering on their national teams and having an unforgettable party."" Defending champion Argentina and Colombia meet at Miami Gardens, Florida, in the tournament finale. The Albiceleste are seeking a record 16th Copa title and are looking to join Spain from 2008-12 as the only countries to win three straight major championships. Uruguay stays in Charlotte to meet Canada in Saturday night's third-place match. Before an overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd of 70,644 that filled Bank of America Stadium with yellow jerseys and flags, Uruguay fell behind for the first time in the tournament. James Rodríguez's corner kick was headed in from short range by Lerma, who outjumped José María Giménez for his third international goal and second of the tournament. Rodríguez has six assists in the tournament -- triple the total of any other player. Muñoz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee César Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Araújo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach. Rodríguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play after Richard Ríos was kicked on a shin by Darwin Núñez. Ríos was removed on a stretcher, re-entered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodríguez was removed at the same time to keep him eligible for the final. Colombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas didn't have to make his first save until he stopped Nicolás de la Cruz in the 68th minute. Luis Suárez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, entered in the 66th minute and hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st. He grasped his head in his hands in disgust. ""The moments in which we could unbalance the game, we did not succeed,"" Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa said. ""We should have generated more goal situations than we did."" Colombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and then the crossbar. Uruguay moved Rochet up to the attacking half of the field in the final minute, desperate for a goal. The match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up the game. Players on the NFL's Carolina Panthers have been outspoken about soccer teams having the luxury of playing on grass on their home field. Players say NFL games on artificial turf leave them more susceptible to injuries. With two games left, attendance of 1.48 million is just 1,663 shy of the total for the 2016 tournament in the United States","the, colombia, minute, copa, uribe, yellow, uruguay, america, panthers, camilo, nester, césar, bielsa, rodríguez, mateus, rochet, card, vargas, charlotte, carolina"

Bangladesh now will play with India, Afghanistan and Australia in one Super Eight group while the United States, England, the West Indies and South Africa will play in the other. The Super Eight stage starts on Wednesday. In a thrilling, low-scoring match, Bangladesh's qualifying hopes looked to be in the balance when it was bowled out for 106 in 19.2 overs after losing the toss. But Tanzim (4-7) bowled his four overs consecutively, leaving Nepal's innings in disarray at 26-5 after the seventh over. Nepal couldn't recover and eventually was bowled out for 85 in the last over on a treacherous pitch at Kingstown, St Vincent. ""We just wanted to keep things very simple and bowl in good areas,"" Tanzim said. ""We didn't panic, we knew could defend this score and we were very confident about that."" The pitch at the Arnos Vale Stadium provided sharp turn and bounce for the Nepal spinners who shared six wickets in the Bangladesh innings. Leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichanne took 2-17 to reach 100 wickets in T20 internationals. Conditions also assisted the seamers with swing and often spiteful bounce. Sompal Kami took 2-10 from his three overs for Nepal, including a wicket for the first ball of the match. But the tough conditions cut both ways. While Nepal took advantage of them to dismiss Bangaldesh cheaply, Bangladesh did the same and to greater effect. The match provided a catalogue of thrills from the moment Sompal dismissed Tanzid Hasan with the very first ball. For no apparent reason Tanzid decided to charge the bowler who fired the ball hard into the pitch. Tanzid's shot came too late and he only managed to spar the ball back to the bowler. Nepal let its control slip at the end of the Bangladesh innings when Mustafizur and Taskin Ahmed put on 18 for the 10th wicket including 11 from the 19th over. Tanzim was superb at the top of the Nepal innings, giving Bangladesh the start it needed. He was fired up, ran in hard, created disconcerting bounce and swung the ball. He bowled Bhurtel with his second ball of the match and dismissed Anil Sah two balls later. Tanzim clashed with Paudel at one point, causing the umpires to caution the Bangladesh captain. But Tanzim had the final say and dismissed Paudel to leave Nepal 20-3 in the fifth over. Aasif Sheikh fell to Mustafizur in the sixth over, after which Nepal was 24-4. Nepal was 42-5 after 10 overs and its hopes of ending the tournament with a win were revived by a 50 partnership for the sixth wicket between Kushal Malla (27) and Airee (25). But the veteran Mustafizur (3-7) conceded only one run and dismissed Malla in the 17th over, then bowled a wicket maiden, removing Airee (25) in the 19th over to help seal the match. Nepal needed 22 from the last over and lost its last two wickets to the first two balls. ""I think as a bowling unit we bowled really well but as a batting unit I think we could have done better, especially the top-order batsmen,"" Paudel said. ""Bangladesh bowled really well with the new ball."" Pakistan bows out Earlier, Pakistan needed allrounder Shaheen Shah Afridi to show off his bowling and batting skills in a three-wicket consolation win over Ireland at Lauderhill, Florida. Afridi destroyed Ireland's top-order batters with 3-22 and then smashed a couple of sixes in his unbeaten 13 off five balls as he guided Pakistan to a scrappy 111-7 in 18.5 overs to win its last Group A game. Captain Babar Azam was 32 not out and helplessly watched another batting collapse before Afridi's little cameo came to Pakistan's rescue. After Pakistan won the toss and chose to bowl first, Afridi's twin-wicket burst in the opening over had Ireland reeling at only 2 runs for the loss of two wickets. Ireland lost another batter to make it 4-3, and was then 15-4 off the first three overs. Left-arm spinner Imad Wasim grabbed 3-8 in four overs to restrict Ireland to 106-9 on a lively wicket which had been under cover for most of the last week because of heavy rain in Florida, which had prevented the previous three games at the tournament venue. ""We lost back-to-back wickets, but managed to get over the line in the end,"" Babar said. ""We've got to go home, chat and see where we lacked and then come back. We couldn't finish off close games... we weren't good as a team."" Pakistan, which failed to chase down a run-a-ball target against rival India and lost to the U.S. in a major upset, nearly messed up against a spirited Ireland bowling attack. At 52-2 after eight overs, it looked comfortable before Barry McCarthy (3-15) and Curtis Campher (2-24) sliced through the brittle middle-order and Pakistan slipped to 62-6 in 11 overs. Abbas Afridi, playing his first game in the tournament, made 17 off 21 balls before he too holed out with 12 needed but Afridi ensured Pakistan didn't lose. Ireland finished last in its group with three defeats and its solitary point coming against the U.S. in a rain-abandoned game at the same venue. Pakistan finished third with four points behind qualifiers India and the United States. Sri Lanka wins Later, Sri Lanka ended its disappointing campaign with an 83-run win over the Netherlands in the final match in Group D at Gros Islet, St. Lucia. The Netherlands came into the match with everything to play for but ended with nothing. It needed Nepal to beat Bangladesh to have a chance of reaching the Super Eight stage. That hope faded when Bangladesh beat Nepal by 21 runs. ""We'll sit down and reflect after the tournament, when we get back to the Netherlands and see which areas we've got to be better at to progress in these sort of tournaments,"" Netherlands captain Scott Edwards said. Sri Lanka lost its first two matches but ended on a high note Sunday. It made an imposing 201-6 batting first, led by Charith Asalanka who made 46 from 21 balls and Kusal Mendis who scored 46 from 29. Dhanajaya de Silva made 34 and Angelo Mathews an unbeaten 30 from 15 deliveries. In reply, the Netherlands was 47-2 after the six-over power play. But it struggled through the middle overs against tight bowling and finally was bowled out for 118 in the 17th over. ""Especially after losing the first two games, this is win is very healthy for us,"" Sri Lanka captain Wanindu Hasaranga said.","the, overs, super, eight, wicket, ball, balls, wickets, afridi, bowling, batting, captain, hasan, wasim, lamichanne, group, edwards, imad, mustafizur, sakib"

Both teams already had qualified for the Super Eight stage but the West Indies finished unbeaten and atop Group C. Obed McCoy took 3-14 as Afghanistan was bowled out for 114 in 16.2 overs and the West Indies sent a message to future rivals in the playoff stage. The West Indies play their first Super Eight match against the United States on Wednesday. Pooran's total was the highest individual total at the tournament and carried him past 2,000 runs in Twenty20 internationals. He hit eight sixes and six fours in an explosive innings which propelled the West Indies to the highest team total at the tournament. ""There were many important moments and at the end of the day it's all about team success,"" Pooran said. ""I felt like it was my day and I had to take the responsibility. When it's your day you have to make it your day."" Earlier, pace bowler Lockie Ferguson achieved the most economical bowling figures in Twenty20 internationals as New Zealand earned a consolation closing win against Papua New Guinea. Pooran took advantage of perfect batting conditions at the Daren Sammy Stadium, launching shots to all parts of the ground and taking 62 runs from blows which pierced or cleared the boundaries. Afghanistan had played its previous matches on difficult, turning pitches on which seamer Fazalhaq Farooqi and its spinners had dominated. It bowled out Uganda for 58, New Zealand for 75 and Papua New Guinea for 95. The West Indies surpassed the highest of those totals Monday in fewer than seven overs. After five overs the West Indies were 85-1 and 92-1 at the end of the six-over power play, the highest total in a power play in T20 World Cup history. Pooran hit sixes from the second and third balls of the 20th over to reach 97, the highest individual total in the World Cup so far. Just as a century seemed inevitable he was run out going back for a second run from the fourth ball, beaten by a direct hit at the striker's end. Farooqi who is the leading wicket-taker at the tournament finished with 0-38, captain Rashid Khan 0-45 and Omarzai 1-41. Gulbadin's 2-14 from two overs stood out as a shining light among the gloom of the Afghanistan bowlers. There was no reprieve for Afghanistan when it batted. Rahmanullah Gurbaz was out to the third ball of its innings, a wicket maiden bowled by Akeal Hossein. After its power play, Afghanistan was 45-1 and after 10 overs it was 66-5 as McCoy dismantled the top order. ""The way they batted, scoring around 90 runs in the power play, it is tough to come back from that,"" Rashid said. ""It's good this loss happened at this stage, not in a do-or-die game. "" Ferguson figures for New Zealand Ferguson bowled four maiden overs and claimed three wickets as PNG was bowled out for 78 runs in 19.4 overs. The target was run down by New Zealand at 79-3 in 12.2 overs. Devon Conway top-scored with 35. Ferguson's figures were only the second instance of a bowler not conceding any runs in a four-over spell in T20s. The other was in 2021 by Canada's Saad Bin Zafar, who picked up two wickets for no runs in four overs against Panama. ""A tough wicket to bat on, nice to bowl on,"" Ferguson said. PNG's batting failed against New Zealand's pace attack. Eight wickets were lost to fast bowling, with Tim Southee taking 2-11. Trent Boult returned 2-14 in four overs in his last T20 appearance for the Black Caps. New Zealand finished third in Group C behind the West Indies and Afghanistan, while PNG went winless in its maiden T20 World Cup.","overs, the, runs, ferguson, eight, t20, zealand, cup, play, fazalhaq, zafar, stage, lockie, pooran, farooqi, saad, super, bin, power, group"

Bangladesh beat Nepal by 21 runs in the match played at Arnos Vale Stadium in Vincent, West Indies. With this match, the equation of Group D in the World Cup has been completed. South Africa and Bangladesh have reached the second round of the World Cup from the group. South Africa has reached the Super Eight with eight points, while Bangladesh having six points have also reached the next round. Nepal, Netherlands and Sri Lanka have been knocked out of the group stage. Nepali leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane however has set a new record by taking 100 wickets in his 54th match of T20 International cricket. In the match against Bangladesh, he took two wickets and completed 100 wickets. This is Sandeep's second match in the ongoing World Cup. Rashid Khan of Afghanistan has a record of taking 100 wickets in 53 matches, the lowest in T20 Internationals. Chasing the target of 107 runs set by Bangladesh to win, Nepal were bundled out for 85 runs losing all wickets on 19.2 overs. Kushal Malla top-scored for Nepal with 27 runs. He scored 27 runs in 40 balls with one four and a six. Dipendra Singh Airee scored 25 runs off 31 balls with two fours and a six.

Bangladesh needed 11 from the last six deliveries to register a famous win, then needed a six off the last ball. Taskin Ahmed came to the crease after Bangladesh's seventh wicket, and faced the last ball, a full toss by Maharaj. Ahmed swung and managed only one run. On a typically tough batting pitch at Nassau County Stadium, South Africa successfully defended its lowly total of 113-6 and restricted Bangladesh to 109-7. It was the lowest target - 114 - ever defended in a T20 World Cup, trumping India's defense of 120 runs just the day before. ""That was not nice on the heart, but feels good that we got over the line,"" said top-scorer Heinrich Klaasen, the player of the match. ""This wicket is not great for stroke play. We got some information from the last game and applied it today. I think we got a decent total on the board. ""We have had three pressure games now and I think we are through (to the next round)."" Maharaj finished with 3-27 in four overs, while Kagiso Rabada (2-19) and Anrich Nortje (2-17) also bowled well. South Africa firmed top spot in Group D with three from three and was in pole position to secure a Super Eight spot. Bangladesh's first loss in two matches kept it in second place. South Africa chased down Sri Lanka and the Netherlands in its previous two matches at the ground, and was made to bat first this time. But it still fumbled another start. Pace bowler Tanzim Sakib trapped opener Reeza Hendricks for a golden duck and had Tristan Stubbs caught for a five-ball duck. Aiden Markram was bowled for 4. In between, Sakib bowled Quinton de Kock for 18 as the Proteas slumped to 23-4 in 4.2 overs. David Miller came up with another rescue job after his half-century against the Netherlands. He scored 29 off 38 balls and put on 79 runs for the fifth wicket with Klaasen. Klaasen top-scored with 46 off 44, including two fours and three sixes. The duo pushed South Africa past 100 before falling in the space of six deliveries. The late strikes left South Africa hanging at just about a par total. Bangladesh's chase faltered at the start, too. It was down to 37-3 and then 50-4 at the halfway stage. Nortje dismissed skipper Nazmul Shanto for 14, and sent back Shakib Al Hasan for just 3, picking up his eighth wicket in three games. Litton Das was out caught off Maharaj, while Rabada had Tanzid Hasan caught behind for 9. Towhid Hridoy and Mahmudullah put on 44 off 45 balls to bring Bangladesh back on track. At 94-4 in the 18th over, Bangladesh was in the driver's seat then lost wickets rapidly to spiral out of control. It went from 94-4 to 108-7 in the space of 17 deliveries. Rabada returned to trap Hridoy but Maharaj's left-arm spin turned the game in the final over. South Africa completes the group stage against Nepal on Friday.

After a match-winning batting performance in the tournament opener against Canada, Jones was instrumental again Thursday in the dramatic win over 2022 runner-up Pakistan. Cricket has a long but relatively little-known history in the United States. It's the national sport in Pakistan, a long-time member of the cricket establishment and a three-time T20 World Cup finalist. The star players are household names. Whereas Jones and the U.S. squad have flown in under the radar. ""Playing against Pakistan for the first time in the World Cup and beating them, it was an unbelievable performance,"" U.S. captain Monank Patel said. ""...beating Pakistan, you know, it's a big achievement."" Patel said as far as he was concerned, the U.S. team's campaign was going to plan. ""We're not worried about what people are saying. We know what we are worth and what capability we have, and we just focus on, the particular game,"" he said. ""We don't want to keep our emotions too high or low. ""We'll make sure that we whatever ... the win today, we will enjoy it and make sure that we next day, we come fresh."" It was a disastrous start for captain Babar Azam's Pakistan, which is due to meet fierce rival India on Sunday in New York. Only the top two teams in each of the five-nation groups advance to the playoffs. ""All credit to the USA,"" Babar said, adding that the Americans performed well in their batting, bowling and fielding departments ""and that's why they won."" ""We couldn't capitalize during the first six overs. We took the momentum, but back-to-back wickets hurt us."" Overshadowed by the upset in Texas, Scotland moved atop Group B with a five-wicket win over Namibia in Bridgetown, Barbados. Namibia posted 155-9 and Scotland reached its winning total with nine balls remaining. The game in Grand Prairie went the full distance, and more. Jones, who smashed a 40-ball unbeaten 94 against Canada, once again starred for the tournament co-host when he stretched the game into a Super Over with another vital knock of 36 not out off 26. Off successive deliveries, Jones hit a six off Haris Rauf and then a single before Nitish Kumar's boundary off the last delivery in regulation tied the scores at 159. Rauf, Pakistan's experienced fast bowler, gave away 14 runs off the last six balls. Pakistan panicked in the Super Over when 32-year-old fast bowler Mohammad Amir, who was part of the 2009 champion team, conceded 18 runs that included seven runs off wide balls as Jones went on the attack. For the U.S., India- born left-arm fast bowler Saurabh Netravalkar, who grabbed 2-18 off his four overs in regulation, conceded just 13 runs in the Super Over to seal the historic win for the U.S. The Americans were on course to stun Pakistan during regulation when skipper Patel hit 50 off 38 balls and Andries Gous added 35 to help the hosts reach 159-3. Pakistan's batting, which has been struggling for a year in the sport's shortest format, was further exposed against some disciplined U.S. seam bowling and was restricted to 159-7. Steven Taylor gave the home team a perfect start when he plucked a brilliant one-handed catch inches off the turf to dismiss Mohammad Rizwan in the second over off Netravalkar's bowling. The left-arm spin of Nosthush Kenjige (3-30) also troubled Pakistan, which slipped to 26-3 in the fifth over. Babar (44) and Shadab Khan (40) tried to regain the momentum and combined for a 72-run stand before Kenjige broke through in the 13th over. Babar, who became world's leading T20 run-getter and surpassed Virat Kohli's tally of 4,038 runs, appeared scratchy in his 43-ball knock before he fell leg before wicket to Jasdeep Singh's delivery in the 16th over as Pakistan slipped to 125-6. It was only due to Shaheen Shah Afridi's 23 off 16 balls, including two late sixes, that lifted Pakistan's total. SCOTLAND WINS Captain Richie Berrington made an unbeaten 47 from 35 balls and shared a 74-run fifth-wicket partnership with Michael Leask (35 from 17) which steered Scotland to its first win over Namibia in four T20 internationals. Scotland took a point from its opening match against England, which was rained out, and now sits atop Group B with three points, ahead of Australia and Namibia with two. Namibia beat Oman in a Super Over finish to its first match. Australia plays England on Saturday. Captain Gerhard Erasmus made 52 from 30 balls and put on 51 for the fifth wicket with Zane Green (28) as Namibia made a 155-9 after choosing to bat. Erasmus then took 2-14, bowling the eighth and 10th overs, to leave Scotland 69-3 at the midpoint of its innings. But Berrington and Leask, coming together at 73-4 after 11 overs, guided Scotland to victory. ""I don't think we're going to get over that for a while,"" Leask said.

Nepal, led by young captain Rohit Kumar Paudel, is set to face South Africa, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and the Netherlands in Group D. One of the die-hard fans of Nepali cricket, Radha Krishna Gajurel, said, ""It can't get any bigger than this T20 World Cup to put Nepal on the global stage. No words can express how excited and happy I am to witness Nepal face off against the Dutch."" Gajurel, a lecturer of Information Technology (IT) at the National College of Computer Studies (NCCS) in Paknajol, Kathmandu, added, ""I have even skipped classes to watch Nepal play at the TU Cricket Ground."" Gajurel, a fervent supporter of Nepali cricket, shared his excitement by highlighting the key players who could make a significant impact in the tournament. He noted, ""The cool-headed leadership of skipper Rohit Paudel, coupled with an explosive start from Kushal Bhurtel and the power-hitting prowess of Kushal Malla, sets a formidable foundation for our team. The finishing touches by Dipendra Singh Airee and Gulshan Jha add depth and reliability to our batting lineup."" Gajurel continued, ""On the bowling front, we have the fiery spells of Sompal Kami and Karan KC, complemented by the spin magic of Lalitraj Bansi. This combination could spring a few surprises for our opponents."" Speaking to THT over the phone, Shakti Gauchan, a member of the Nepal team that represented the country at the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2014, said, ""It's a historic moment for all of us. Winning and losing are part of the game; now it's time to enjoy every moment of it."" ""It's even more special as Sompal Kami, who was with us in 2014, is still playing, and Kushal Malla, a native of Butwal Sub-metropolitan -13, whom I have mentored since he was a kid, is representing Nepal. What more can I ask for?"" Gauchan said. ""I feel like I am playing myself as Kushal Malla is there,"" Gauchan reminisced about how he spotted Malla as a power hitter even in his school days while coaching kids at New Horizon School in Butwal. ""He was unique from the beginning, having natural power-hitting ability, being a left-handed batsman and a left-arm spin bowler. We backed his ability, and now he is where he should be. It's an amazing and proud moment as a mentor."" Seeing potential in his ability, Gauchan visited Malla's parents to let him play cricket, but his mother, Sarmila Malla, was initially unsure and wanted her son to focus on his studies. ""We allowed Kushal to focus on cricket as he was so in love with the sport. He used to collect his friends to play with him and even give them awards to keep them engaged,"" Sarmila Malla shared with THT. ""At times, we had to ask him to sleep as he used to practice individually all night,"" Kushal's mother added. ""With his selection to the U-16, then to U-19 team and to the national team, we are satisfied with his progress. What more could we ask for as he is representing our nation on the international stage?"" ""Whenever he plays, I never watch continuously but check regularly to see how he is doing,"" Kushal's mother shared, adding, ""I want him to remain in Nepal and be involved in sports in any capacity."" ""I am not just cheering for my son; I am cheering for the whole team. I want the team to do really well and advance to the next level, just like other mothers whose sons are representing Nepal in the USA and West Indies."" With a mix of both youth and senior pros, the team is going to spring surprises. The team is full of potential stars, and on any given day, anybody could be a star for the team, Sarmila Malla said, adding that she now understands the game more. ""Although playing against a test nation is a challenge in itself, you never know what can happen on a given day. We are capable of creating an upset as the team looks balanced and has the momentum."" Sohan Shrestha from Butwal, who represented Nepal at the junior level in Pakistan and is a member of the Rupendehi Cricket Board, said, ""We are all very excited to see Nepal's colors flying on the international stage."" ""We have a balanced team, experienced pacers, a good mix of spinners, and exciting all-rounders including Dipendra Singh Airee, Kushal Malla, and Gulshan Jha."" ""The opening stand looks shaky at the moment, but once it clicks, we will be a threat to other nations,"" Shrestha said, adding that cricket is a funny game where anything is possible. Similarly, Punit Pokhrel, a former fast bowler who played in regional tournaments in and around Rupandehi district, expressed his excitement and is eagerly awaiting Nepal's mark on the international stage. Reflecting on that moment in 2014, Gauchan recalled how standing for the national anthem at the T20 World Cup still gives him goosebumps. It was a moment of immense pride and pure joy for our nation. To the 2024 team, let your hearts beat with passion and savor every moment.

Chasing a meagre target of 107 runs for victory, the Dutch made light work of the Nepali bowlers, achieving the total with six wickets in hand and eight balls to spare in their alloted 20 overs. Man-of-the-match Tim Pringle's impressive figures of 3/20 and Max O'Dowd's composed, unbeaten 54 guided the Dutch to a convincing victory over Nepal in front of a full house Grand Prairie Stadium. Defending a modest total, the Nepali bowlers strove valiantly to take the game down to the wire despite receiving no support from the fielders, who dropped several crucial catches. The adage ""catches win matches"" did not hold true for Nepal today. Sompal Kami provided Nepal with a dream start by dismissing opener Michael Levitt, caught by Dipendra Singh Airee in the second over. However, Kami himself dropped Vikramjit Singh off Avinash Bohara's bowling before Dipendra trapped Singh leg before for 22 runs off 28 balls, which included four boundaries. As the Netherlands began to cruise, Kami was reintroduced into the attack and managed to run out Sybrand Engelbrecht off his own bowling from a fierce strike by Max O'Dowd at the non-striker's end. Avinash Bohara then bowled Dutch skipper Scott Edwards, pulling Nepal back into the game with the Netherlands at 80/4 in the 16th over, needing 27 runs off 28 balls. As the Dutch marched towards victory, Rohit Kumar Paudel dropped a straightforward catch of Max O'Dowd off Sompal Kami's bowling with 16 runs required at a run-a-ball. After this reprieve, Max O'Dowd reached his milestone of 50 runs and, in the following overs, comfortably guided his team to victory. Sompal Kami, Abinash Bohara and Dipendra Singh Airee took a wicket each in the losing cause. Earlier, capitalizing on overcast conditions, the Netherlands opted to bowl and efficiently restricted Nepal to a mere 106 all out in the 19th over of their allotted 20 overs. Exploiting the overcast conditions, Dutch bowlers maintained a probing line and length, testing Nepali batters before dismantling them. Aarif Sheikh fell early, caught by Kingma off Pringle in the 2nd over. Van Beek then dismissed Kushal Bhurtel with the score at 15. Skipper Rohit Paudel fought valiantly, scoring 35 runs off 37 balls, but was eventually caught at long-on. Kushal Malla looked promising in the middle, hitting a boundary over the long-on fielder, but perished while trying to replicate the shot, falling for a run-a-ball nine. Despite Paudel's efforts, Nepal continued to lose wickets, with Dipendra Singh Airee departing soon after, caught by Van Beek off De Leede. Sompal Kami's promotion in the batting order ended swiftly as he was bowled by van Meekeren for a duck. Lower-order batsmen Gulshan Jha and Karan KC contributed some quick runs, but it was not enough. Lower-order batsmen Gulshan Jha and Karan KC managed to hit three sixes between them, taking Nepal's total past the 100-mark. Jha and KC contributed 14 and 17 runs, respectively. Tim Pringle and Logan van Beek took three wickets each, while Paul van Meekeren and Bas de Leede shared four wickets to wrap up Nepal's innings. With this victory, the Netherlands secured two points, moving into second position behind South Africa, with both teams having 2 points based on net run rate. During the post-match press conference, Nepal's skipper Rohit Kumar Paudel acknowledged the Dutch bowlers for capitalizing on the early conditions. He added, ""We also lacked partnerships in the middle, which was the turning point of the game. Our bowlers performed well today, but they weren't supported by the fielders. It could have been a different game entirely if I hadn't dropped that catch. As a batting unit, if we perform better, we can expect improved results in the upcoming matches."" Similarly, Dutch skipper Edwards commented, ""The pitch posed challenges, and our bowlers executed their plans well to restrict Nepal. While we would have preferred to achieve the target earlier, the chase became tricky towards the end. To progress further, we need to maintain consistency in our performances."" In their upcoming group fixture, Nepal is slated to face Sri Lanka at the Central Broward Park in Florida on June 12th.","the, van, dutch, bohara, runs, skipper, sompal, bowlers, kami, avinash, rohit, paudel, pringle, beek, leede, meekeren, dowd, levitt, singh, edwards"

His extraordinary Indian Premier League form wasn't enough to supplant anyone in the preliminary 15-man Australian squad that was announced May 1, but did earn him a spot as a traveling reserve for the tournament next month. Australia coach Andrew McDonald confirmed the squad on Tuesday - with Warner, Travis Head and skipper Mitch Marsh remaining first choice top-order batters - and added Fraser-McGurk and Matthew Short as injury cover. ""There's no doubt what he did in the IPL, he lit it up,"" McDonald told Australia's SEN radio. ""He's an extraordinary talent (and) there's no doubt that he did turn our heads."" The 22-year-old Fraser-McGurk soared into Australia's selection calculations with 330 runs at an almost surreal strike-rate of 234 for the Delhi Capitals. His four half-centuries included two off 15 balls as he shredded bowling attacks. He got his IPL break because of an injury to Warner, thanks to some input from former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, but he couldn't unseat the 37-year-old veteran for the global T20 World Cup starting June 1 in the U.S. and Caribbean. And while McDonald conceded Fraser-McGurk was a ""huge discussion"" for the World Cup when he was running hot, he said the young batter didn't quite fit into the mix selectors had been working on since Australia lost the title in 2022. Warner has been bothered by hand injury that disrupted his IPL season, but McDonald said Australian selectors have ""no fears that he won't be fit and fully available."" It's likely to be the last World Cup for Warner, who burst onto the international scene in 2009 as a hard-hitting, rapid scorer and became one of the most enduring batters in test and limited-overs cricket. Marsh, who is recovering from an injured hamstring, was confirmed as T20 captain last month after sharing the duties on an interim basis since the retirement last year of Aaron Finch. Allrounder Marsh will likely bat at No. 3 and Glenn Maxwell at No. 4 in the lineup, with Tim David likely to fill the finisher role further down the order. Matt Wade and Josh Inglis were picked as wicketkeepers and Ashton Agar returns to the squad as a second spinning option to Adam Zampa. The regular pace bowling trio of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood will have support from Nathan Ellis as well as allrounders Cameron Green, Marsh and Marcus Stoinis. Australia, the 2021 T20 World Cup champions, will open against Oman at Barbados on June 5. The Australians are the defending champions in the ICC's World Test Championship and in the 50-over World Cup. Australia squad: Mitch Marsh (captain), Ashton Agar, Pat Cummins, Tim David, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, Matt Wade, David Warner, Adam Zampa.

In a separate development, Hamas announced that one of its top commanders had been killed, without saying when or how. Israel's military confirmed it. The second exchange was delayed for hours Saturday after Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement, which has brought the first significant pause in seven weeks of war marked by the deadliest Israeli-Palestinian violence in decades and vast destruction and displacement across the Gaza Strip. Hamas later released 13 Israelis and four Thais, while Israel freed 39 Palestinian prisoners. Diaa Rashwan, chair of the Egyptian State Information Services, said Egypt had received a list of 13 hostages that Hamas will release Sunday, and another list of 39 Palestinians that Israel is expected to free. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the U.S. had ""reason to believe"" that an American hostage would be released Sunday and said there were hopes it would be Abigail Edan, the 4-year-old girl who lost her parents in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7. Sullivan also said that U.S. President Joe Biden would speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later Sunday. Separately, Hamas said it had released one of the Russian hostages it was holding, ""in response to the efforts of Russian President Vladimir Putin"" and as a show of appreciation for Moscow's position on the war. Israeli army radio had reported that it was an Israeli-Russian dual national. Hamas and other militant groups seized around 240 people during the rampage across southern Israel that ignited the war. Forty-four have been released, one was freed by Israeli forces and two were found dead inside Gaza. Pressure from hostages' families has sharpened the dilemma facing Israel's leaders, who seek to eliminate Hamas as a military and governing power while returning all the captives. The war has claimed the lives of more than 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians killed by Hamas in the initial attack. More than 13,300 Palestinians have been killed, roughly two thirds of them women and minors, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. The four-day cease-fire, which began Friday, was brokered by Qatar and Egypt and the United States. Hamas will release at least 50 Israeli hostages, and Israel will free 150 Palestinian prisoners. All are women and minors. Israel has said the truce can be extended by an extra day for every additional 10 hostages freed, but has vowed to quickly resume its offensive once it ends. Sullivan said the U.S. is working ""with all sides on the possibility that this deal gets extended to additional hostages beyond the initial 50."" HAMAS COMMANDER KILLED Hamas announced the death of Ahmed al-Ghandour, who was in charge of northern Gaza and a member of its top military council. He is the highest-ranking militant known to have been killed in the fighting. Al-Ghandour, believed to have been around 56 years old, had survived at least three Israeli attempts on his life and was involved in a cross-border attack in 2006 in which Palestinian militants captured an Israeli soldier, according to the Counter Extremism Project, an advocacy group based in Washington. Hamas said that he was killed along with three other senior militants, including Ayman Siam, who Israel says was in charge of Hamas' rocket-firing unit. The Israeli military mentioned both men in a Nov. 16 statement, saying it had targeted an underground complex where Hamas leaders were hiding. The Israeli military claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence, including several mid-ranking commanders it has identified by name. AID AND RESPITE IN GAZA The pause has given some respite to Gaza's 2.3 million people, still reeling from relentless Israeli bombardment that has driven three-quarters of the population from their homes and leveled residential areas. Rocket fire from Gaza militants into Israel also went silent. War-weary Palestinians in northern Gaza, where the offensive has focused, returned to the streets. Entire city blocks in and around Gaza City have been gutted by airstrikes that hollowed out buildings and left drifts of rubble. In southern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people from the north have sought refuge, residents lined up outside gas stations, hoping to stock up on fuel. Palestinians who have tried to return to the north to see if their homes are intact have been turned back by Israeli troops. ""Many are desperate to return to their homes, but they open fire on anyone approaching from the south,"" said Rami Hazarein, who fled from Gaza City last month. The Israeli military has ordered Palestinians not to return to the north or approach within a kilometer (around a half-mile) of the border fence. The Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service said that Israeli forces opened fire Sunday on two farmers in central Gaza, killing one and wounding the other. It didn't provide further details. An Israeli military spokesperson said they weren't aware of the incident. The United Nations said the truce has made it possible to scale up the delivery of food, water, and medicine to the largest volume since the start of the war, though it still hasn't reached prewar levels. It was able to deliver fuel for the first time since the war began, and to reach areas in the north for the first time in a month. HOSTAGES FOR PRISONERS The Israeli hostages freed on Saturday included seven children and six women, ranging in age from 3 to 67. Most were from Kibbutz Be'eri, a community that Hamas militants ravaged during their Oct. 7 attack. The freed hostages have mostly stayed out of the public eye. Hospitals said their physical condition has been good, aside from one who was shot during the attack and required surgery. Little is publicly known about the conditions of their captivity. Eyal Nouri, the nephew of Adina Moshe, 72, who was freed on Friday, said his aunt ""had to adjust to the sunlight"" because she had been in complete darkness for weeks. The released Palestinians included at least two women who had been given long sentences after being convicted by Israeli courts of violent attacks. Many Palestinians view prisoners held by Israel, including those implicated in attacks, as heroes resisting occupation, and have celebrated their release. The war in Gaza has been accompanied by a surge in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Palestinian health authorities said Sunday that five Palestinians were killed in an Israeli military raid in the northern West Bank city of Jenin that began the day before. The Israeli army has conducted frequent military raids and arrested hundreds of Palestinians since the start of the war, mostly people it suspects of being Hamas members.","israeli, the, hostages, gaza, hamas, palestinian, palestinians, military, militants, at, least, prisoners, attack, rocket, crescent, ghandour, sullivan, truce, militant, an"

The leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group stoked fears that the conflict could widen by promising more attacks along the Lebanon border. Israeli troops tightened their encirclement of Gaza City, the focus of their campaign to crush the enclave's ruling Hamas militants, who launched a brutal attack on Israeli communities that started the war. But ever since that Oct. 7 assault, there have been concerns the conflict could ignite fighting on other fronts, and Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah have repeatedly traded fire along the Lebanon border. In his first public speech since the war began, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said his group had ""entered the battle"" with the past weeks' unprecedented cross-border fighting. ""We will not be limited to this,"" he said, suggesting escalation was possible. Still, Nasrallah stopped short of announcing that Hezbollah is fully engaging in the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on his third trip to Israel since the war began, reiterated US support for Israel in the war, saying it has the right to defend itself. But he said a ""humanitarian pause"" was needed to boost aid deliveries to Palestinian civilians amid growing alarm over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. After meeting Blinken, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel ""refuses a temporary cease-fire that doesn't include a return of our hostages,"" referring to some 240 people Hamas abducted during its attack. He said Israel was pressing ahead with its military offensive with ""all of its power."" Blinken said there had to be a substantial and immediate increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza, where ""we need to do more to protect Palestinian civilians."" Without that, ""there are no partners for peace,"" he said, adding that it was critical to restore the path toward a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, attacked Israeli military positions in northern Israel with drones, mortar fire and suicide drones on Thursday. The Israeli military said it retaliated with warplanes and helicopter gunships, and spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said civilians were wounded in the Hezbollah attacks. ""We are in a high state of readiness in the north, in a very high state of alert, to respond to any event today and in coming days,"" he said. Blinken said the US, which has deployed aircraft carriers and other forces in the eastern Mediterranean, was committed to ensuring that no ""second or third front"" opens in the conflict, referring to Hezbollah. In his speech, Nasrallah said his militia is not deterred by US warnings, saying: ""Your fleets in the Mediterranean ... will not scare us."" A war with Hezbollah would be devastating for both Israel and Lebanon. Hezbollah is much stronger than Hamas, with an arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and missiles, some believed to be precision-guided weapons capable of striking deep inside Israel. Israel has promised to unleash vast destruction in Lebanon if all-out war erupts, accusing Hezbollah of hiding its military installation in the midst of residential areas. The two enemies fought an inconclusive monthlong war in 2006. Renewed fighting could also risk drawing Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, into the conflict. More than 9,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza so far, mostly women and minors, and more and than 23,000 people have been wounded, the Gaza Health Ministry said, without providing a breakdown between civilians and fighters. More than 1,400 people have died on the Israeli side, mainly civilians killed during Hamas' initial attack, when some 240 people were also taken hostage. Some 5,400 have also been injured. Twenty-four Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the ground operation. Since the start of the war, seven Israeli soldiers and a civilian have been killed in different incidents along Israel's border with Lebanon. BLINKEN'S LATEST TRIP As American officials have before, Blinken pledged unwavering support for Israel and its right to defend itself. ""We stand strongly for the proposition that Israel has not only the right but the obligation to defend itself, and to make sure that October 7 should never happen again,"" said Blinken, who also plans to visit Amman, Jordan. It follows President Joe Biden's suggestion for a humanitarian ""pause"" in the fighting. The aim would be to let in aid for Palestinians and let out more Palestinians who hold foreign passports and wounded. Around 800 people left Gaza over the past two days - the first time people departed the besieged territory other than four hostages released by Hamas and another rescued by Israeli forces. Blinken first held talks with Netanyahu behind closed doors before starting wider discussions with the leader and his War Cabinet and meeting with President Isaac Herzog. More than 3,700 Palestinian children have been killed in 25 days of fighting, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Bombardment has driven more than half the territory's 2.3 million people from their homes. Food, water and fuel are running low under Israel's siege, and overwhelmed hospitals warn they are on the verge of collapse. Israel has allowed more than 260 trucks carrying food and medicine into Gaza, but aid workers say it's not nearly enough. Israeli authorities have refused to allow fuel in, saying Hamas is hoarding fuel for military use and would steal new supplies. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the US was not advocating for a general cease-fire but a ""temporary, localized"" pause. Israel has not openly responded to Biden's suggestion. But Netanyahu, who has previously ruled out a cease-fire, said Thursday: ""We are advancing. ... Nothing will stop us."" He vowed to destroy Hamas rule in the Gaza Strip. Israel and the US seem to have no clear plan for what would come next if Hamas rule in Gaza is brought down - a key question on Blinken's agenda during the visit, according to the State Department. GAZA CITY ENCIRCLED Meanwhile, military officials said Israeli forces have now completely encircled Gaza City, a densely packed cluster of neighborhoods that Israel says is the center of Hamas military infrastructure and includes a vast network of underground tunnels, bunkers and command centers. Israeli forces are ""fighting in a built-up, dense, complex area,"" said the military's chief of staff, Herzi Halevy. Hagari, the military spokesperson, said Israeli forces were in ""face to face"" battles with militants, calling in airstrikes and shelling when needed. He said they were inflicting heavy losses on Hamas fighters and destroying their infrastructure with engineering equipment. Hamas' military wing said early Friday that its fighters battled Israeli troops in several areas in Gaza and claimed they killed four soldiers on the northern edge of the city of Beit Lahiya. It also claimed to have destroyed several tanks with locally made anti-tank rockets. Neither the reports from Israel nor Hamas could be independently verified. Casualties on both sides were expected to rise as Israeli troops advance toward the dense residential neighborhoods of Gaza City. Israel has warned residents to immediately evacuate the Shati refugee camp, which borders Gaza City's center. But hundreds of thousands of Palestinians remain in the path of fighting in northern Gaza, despite Israel's repeated calls for them to flee. Many have crowded into U.N. facilities, hoping for safety. Still, four U.N. schools-turned-shelter in northern Gaza and Bureij were hit in recent days, killing 24 people, according to Philippe Lazzarini, general-secretary of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. In the occupied West Bank overnight, Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians in different places and arrested many more, according to the Israeli military and Palestinian health officials.","israeli, the, gaza, military, than, more, hamas, israel, cease, war, palestinian, aid, fire, humanitarian, city, pause, blinken, kirby, hagari, netanyahu"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/un-agency-in-gaza-says-urgent-cease-fire-is-matter-of-life-and-death-for-millions-of-palestinians,UN agency in Gaza says urgent cease-fire is `matter of life and death' for millions of Palestinians,Associated Press,2023-10-31 09:15:55,"UNITED NATIONS, OCTOBER 31 The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees told a UN emergency meeting Monday ""an immediate humanitarian cease-fire has become a matter of life and death for millions,"" accusing Israel of ""collective punishment"" of Palestinians and the forced displacement of civilians. Philippe Lazzarini warned that a further breakdown of civil order following the looting of the agency's warehouses by Palestinians searching for food and other aid ""will make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the largest U.N. agency in Gaza to continue operating."" Briefings to the Security Council by Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF and a senior U.N. humanitarian official painted a dire picture of the humanitarian situation in Gaza 23 days after Hamas' surprise Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, and its ongoing retaliatory military action aimed at ""obliterating"" the militant group, which controls Gaza. According to the latest figures from Gaza's Ministry of Health, more than 8,300 people have been killed – 66% of them women and children – and tens of thousands injured, the U.N. humanitarian office said. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell that toll includes over 3,400 children killed and more than 6,300 injured. ""This means that more than 420 children are being killed or injured in Gaza each day – a number which should shake each of us to our core,"" she said. Lazzarini said: ""This surpasses the number of children killed annually across the world's conflict zones since 2019."" And he stressed, ""This cannot be `collateral damage.'"" Many speakers at the council meeting denounced Hamas' Oct. 7 surprise attacks on Israel that killed over 1,400 people, and urged the release of some 230 hostages taken to Gaza by the militants. But virtually every speaker also stressed that Israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and their essentials for life including hospitals, schools and other infrastructure – and Israel was criticized for cutting off food, water, fuel and medicine to Gaza and cutting communications for several days. Lazzarini said ""the handful of convoys"" allowed into Gaza through the Rafah crossing from Egypt in recent days ""is nothing compared to the needs of over 2 million people trapped in Gaza."" ""The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail,"" he said, ""unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs."" The commissioner-general of the U.N. agency known as UNRWA said there is no safe place anywhere in Gaza, warning that basic services are crumbling, medicine, food, water and fuel are running out, and the streets ""have started overflowing with sewage, which will cause a massive health hazard very soon."" UNICEF oversees water and sanitation issues for the U.N., and Russell warned that ""the lack of clean water and safe sanitation is on the verge of becoming a catastrophe."" U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield urged the divided Security Council – which has rejected four resolutions that would have responded to the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and the ongoing war – to come together, saying ""the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing more dire by the day."" Stressing that all innocent civilians must be protected, she said the council must call ""for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, address the immense humanitarian needs of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, affirm Israel's right to defend itself from terrorism, and remind all actors that international humanitarian law must be respected."" She reiterated President Joe Biden's calls for humanitarian pauses to get hostages out and allow aid in, and for safe passage for civilians. ""That means Hamas must not use Palestinians as human shields – an act of unthinkable cruelty and a violation of the law of war,"" the U.S. ambassador said, ""and that means Israel must take all possible precautions to avoid harm to civilians."" In a sign of increasing U.S. concern at the escalating Palestinian death toll, Thomas-Greenfield told the council Biden reiterated to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday ""that while Israel has the right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism, it must do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law."" ""The fact that Hamas operates within and under the cover of civilians areas creates an added burden for Israel, but it does not lessen its responsibility to distinguish between terrorists and innocent civilians,"" she stressed. Following the rejection of the four resolutions in the 15-member Security Council – one vetoed by the U.S., one vetoed by Russia and China, and two for failing to get the minimum nine ""yes"" votes – Arab nations went to the U.N. General Assembly last Friday where there are no vetoes. The 193-member world body adopted a resolution calling for humanitarian truces leading to a cessation of hostilities by a vote of 120-14 with 45 abstentions. Now, the 10 elected members in the 15-member Security Council are trying again to negotiate a resolution that won't be rejected. While council resolutions are legally binding, assembly resolutions are not though they are an important barometer of world opinion. Israel's U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan was sharply critical of the council's failure to condemn Hamas' attacks and asked members: ""Why are the humanitarian needs of Gazans, the sole issue, the sole issue you are focused on?"" Recalling his grandfather who survived Nazi death camps but whose his wife and seven children perished in the Auschwitz gas chamber, Erdan told the council he will wear a yellow star – just as Hitler made his grandfather and other Jews wear during World War II – ""until you condemn the atrocities of Hamas and demand the immediate release of our hostages."" The ambassador then put a large six-pointed yellow star of David saying ""Never Again"" on his suit jacket, as did other Israeli diplomats sitting behind him, and said: ""We walk with the yellow star as a symbol of pride, a reminder that we swore to fight back to defend ourselves. Never again is now."" Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, also urged the Security Council to follow the General Assembly, end its paralysis, and demand ""an end to this bloodshed, which constitutes an affront to humanity, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and a clear and imminent danger for regional and international peace and security."" ""Save those who still can be saved and bury in a dignified manner those who have perished,"" Mansour said.","the, humanitarian, council, ambassador, resolutions, agency, greenfield, needs, palestinian, oct, civilians, hamas, assembly, erdan, gilad, attacks, security, hostages, catherine, thomas"

Buoyed by the first successful rescue of a captive held by Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls for a cease-fire and again vowed to crush the militant group's ability to govern Gaza or threaten Israel following its bloody Oct. 7 rampage, which ignited the war. The military said one of the estimated 240 captives seized by Palestinian militants during the wide-ranging assault was rescued in a special forces operation, lending support to Netanyahu's contention that the ground war will help facilitate the recovery of more hostages rather than putting them in increased danger. The army said Pvt. Ori Megidish, 19, was ""doing well"" and had been reunited with her family. Hamas has released four hostages, and has said it would let the others go in return for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, which has dismissed the offer. Hamas released a short video Monday showing three other female captives. More than half the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians have fled their homes, with hundreds of thousands sheltering in packed U.N.-run schools-turned-shelters or in hospitals alongside thousands of wounded patients. Israeli strikes have hit closer to several northern hospitals in recent days, alarming medics. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, says nearly 672,000 Palestinians are sheltering in its schools and other facilities - four times their capacity. Thousands of people broke into its aid warehouses over the weekend to take food, as supplies of basic goods have dwindled. There has been no central electricity in Gaza for weeks, and Israel has barred the entry of fuel needed to power emergency generators for hospitals and homes. UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini accused Israel of ""collective punishment"" of the Palestinians, and of forcing their displacement from northern Gaza to the south, where they are still not safe. The war has also threatened to ignite other fronts. Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group have traded fire on a daily basis along the border, and Israel and the U.S. have struck targets in Syria linked to Iran, which supports Hamas, Hezbollah and other armed groups in the region. The military said it shot down a drone outside Israeli airspace on Tuesday near the Red Sea city of Eilat, without providing further details. Earlier this month, a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Red Sea, intercepted three cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. In the occupied West Bank, where Israeli-Palestinian violence has also surged, the army demolished the family home of Saleh al-Arouri, a senior Hamas official exiled over a decade ago. Ali Kaseeb, head of the local council in the village of Aroura, said the home had been vacant for 15 years. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said ground operations in Gaza are focused on the north, including Gaza City, which he said was the ""center of gravity of Hamas."" ""But we also continue to strike in other parts of Gaza. We are hunting their commanders, we are attacking their infrastructure, and whenever there is an important target that is related to Hamas, we strike it,"" he said. Larger ground operations have been launched both north and east of Gaza City, which before the war was home to over 650,000 people, a population comparable to that of Washington, D.C. Video footage released by the military showed soldiers walking across an open area as heavy gunfire echoes in the background and setting up a position in the ruins of a heavily damaged building. Conricus said some 800,000 people have heeded the Israeli military's orders to flee from the northern part of the strip to the south. But tens of thousands of people remain in and around Gaza City, and casualties are expected to mount on both sides as the battle moves into dense, residential neighborhoods. The window for more people to flee south may be closing, as Israeli forces reached Gaza's main north-south highway this week. Video circulating Monday showed a tank opening fire on a car that had approached a sand berm but was turning around. Gaza's Health Ministry said three people were killed. Zaki Abdel-Hay, a Palestinian man living a few minutes' walk from the road south of Gaza City, said people are afraid to use it. ""People are very scared. The Israeli talks are still close,"" he said over the phone, adding that""constant artillery fire"" could be heard near the road. The military said it struck some 300 militant targets over the past day and that troops had engaged in several battles with Palestinian militants armed with antitank missiles and machine guns. Hamas' military wing said it fired mortar rounds at Israel forces near a closed border crossing between Israel and Gaza in the southern end of the territory. It was not possible to independently confirm the reports. In a news conference late Monday, Netanyahu rejected calls for a cease-fire to facilitate the release of captives or end the war, which he has said will be long and difficult. ""Calls for a cease-fire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas,"" he told a news conference. ""That will not happen."" Netanyahu, who faces mounting anger over Israel's failure to prevent the worst surprise attack on the country in a half century, also said he had no plans to resign. The death toll among Palestinians passed 8,300, mostly women and children, the Gaza Health Ministry said Monday. The figure is without precedent in decades of Israeli-Palestinian violence. More than 1.4 million people in Gaza have fled their homes. Over 1,400 people have died on the Israeli side, mainly civilians killed during Hamas' initial attack, also an unprecedented figure. Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets into Israel. Gaza's humanitarian crisis is meanwhile continuing to worsen. The World Health Organization said two hospitals have been damaged and an ambulance destroyed in Gaza over the last two days. It said all 13 hospitals operating in the north have received Israeli evacuation orders in recent days. Medics have refused such orders, saying it would be a death sentence for patients on life support. Israel says it targets Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that the militants operate among civilians, putting them in danger. Israel has allowed more than 150 trucks loaded with food and medicine to enter Gaza from Egypt over the past several days, but aid workers say it's not enough to meet rapidly growing needs. The Israeli government said in a statement that all deliveries are inspected by Israeli forces, and that ""should it become clear that they have been taken by Hamas, they will be halted."" Israel says it has reopened two main water lines in Gaza, but the U.N. office for humanitarian affairs said one of them had stopped working after operating for two weeks and that the other one was in need of repairs.","the, israeli, gaza, palestinian, hamas, more, military, 000, strip, video, than, netanyahu, people, orders, militants, palestinians, lazzarini, sea, hospitals, medics"

This is the first visit of Secretary-General Guterres to Nepal after his assumption of Office on 1 January 2017. The UN Secretary-General, who is visiting Nepal at the invitation of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, will address the joint session of the federal Parliament on 31 October 2023, according to a press release issued by Nepal's Foreign Ministry. Guterres is also scheduled to make firsthand observations of the impacts of climate change on the Himalayas and will hold a brief conversation with the affected communities, according to MoFA. He will visit Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautam Buddha and Pokhara the same day. The Secretary-General will be accompanied by Jean Pierre Lacroix, Under-secretary General for Peace Operations, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations to Nepal and other officials from the UN Headquarters in New York and the United Nations country team in Nepal. During the visit, Secretary General Guterres will call on President Ramchandra Paudel and hold meeting with the Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and other dignitaries. According to Spokesperson for the Parliament Secretariat Ekram Giri, in the House of Representatives meeting scheduled for October 29, Speaker Devraj Ghimire will inform the members of the HoR about the UN Secretary General's address to the joint session of the Parliament at 4:00pm on October 31. Giri said the National Assembly Chair had sent SMS to the members of the Upper House informing them about the UN Secretary General's address to the joint session of Parliament on October 31. On the same day, Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud will table a motion seeking ratification of BIMSTEC charter. Similarly, Finance Minister Prakash Sharan Mahat will table the Banking Offence and Punishment Act (Second Amendment) Bill 2023. Nepal's former permanent representative to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva Dinesh Bhattarai said that UN Secretary General's visit to Nepal will be an important opportunity for Nepal to enhance its image internationally and let the world body's chief know what Nepal's policies are on some of the global issues. He said the UN Secretary General's visit will promote understanding and trust between UN and Nepal. ""We are victims of climate injustice and it will be better if we can show him some of the places where the impacts of climate change are glaring,"" he added. Bhattarai said Nepal should also tell Guterres that being thehat being the second largest troop contributor to UN peacekeeping missions, Nepal deserved to lead the Field Headquarters. Nepal has not got a chance to lead the UN Field Headquarters that deploys peacekeeping soldiers. He said the government also needed to tell Guterres to help repatriate 6,000 Bhutanese refugees whose plight he knew very well as he had served as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the past. ""Every Bhutanese refugee has the right to return to their motherland with dignity and Guterres being the chief of the world body can play an important role in upholding Bhutanese refugees' right,"" Bhattarai said. Bhattarai, however, said he did not think Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's appeal to the international community seeking their help to conclude the peace process was a good idea. He said if Guterres raised any question about transitional justice, it could send a bad message to international community. ""We have completed almost everything related to the peace process, including the integration of Maoist combatants but we have not been able to resolve issues related to transitional justice and I do not know why,"" Bhattarai said and added as the victims and perpetrators were in Nepal, the best thing would be to first see how much reparation and other remedies that victims got and how the perpetrators admit their mistakes. Guterres who was the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2007, had visited the refugee camp in Jhapa the same year. A version of this article appears in the print on October 28, 2023, of The Himalayan Times.","the, secretary, un, general, october, guterres, pushpa, bhutanese, kamal, dahal, visit, prakash, refugees, ekram, headquarters, nations, sharan, peacekeeping, parliament, united"

He was greeted at Pumdikot at 4:30 pm by Chandra Kant Baral, Chairperson of the Pumdikot Development Committee, and Dhan Raj Acharya, Mayor of Pokhara metropolitan city, among others. Secretary-General Guterres visited the tallest idol of Lord Shiva (Mahadev) at Pumdikot and enjoyed the panoramic view of the mountains and various places surrounding Pokhara, including Phewa Lake. During the visit, the UN Secretary-General spent around half an hour at Pumdikot, as reported by Committee member Matrika Baral. The 51-meter tall idol of Mahadev, constructed at Pumdikot, is gaining popularity as an attractive tourist destination in Pokhara. From Pumdikot, which is located approximately 13 kilometers away from the main bazaar of Pokhara, one can view different mountains, including Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, and the Pokhara Valley.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-nepal-china-deals,EDITORIAL: Nepal-China deals,The Himalayan Times,2023-09-27 08:58:43,"Nepal and China signed 12 agreements during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's official visit to Beijing on Monday, which, among others, include promoting bilateral trade, and cooperating in agriculture, fisheries and livestock development, power grid interconnection project, and science, technology and innovation. The agreements were signed between the relevant ministries and commissions of both the countries in the presence of PM Dahal and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang in the Great Hall of the People, according to a press release issued by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing. However, both the countries did not issue a joint press statement due to differences of opinion on other issues proposed by China. The memoranda of understanding (MoU) were reached in areas related to the National Planning Commission of Nepal and National Development Reform Commission of China, digital economy, green and low carbon development, agriculture, livestock and fisheries, Nepal-China trade and payment, protocol of phytosanitary requirements for export of plant-derived medicinal materials from Nepal to China, translation and publication of classics, science, technology and innovation, disaster relief material, Hilsa-Simikot road project and the Nepal-China power grid interconnection project (Chilime-Keyrong). Other agreements apart, the MoU to develop Nepal-China power grid in-terconnection can be said to be a major development, which will open the door for exporting Nepal's electricity even to our northern neighbour. From now onwards, both the countries will work out a plan of action to construct a 220kV trans-mission line from Chilime to Keyrong, China. Although Nepal and China had already initiated feasibility study on this project five years ago, no progress has been made due to uncertainty in the investment modality. Many hydropower projects in Nepal initiated by various Chinese firms could not kick-start due to lack of market guarantee. Once the proposed transmission line comes into operation, Nepal will no longer need to depend solely on India for the export of its surplus energy produced here. Construction of the north-south transmission line should encourage Chinese companies to invest in Nepal's energy sector. Nepal's former ambassadors to China said no notable agreement was reached under China's Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI), of which Nepal became a member in 2017. Nepal has been expecting grants to develop infrastructures under the BRI, whereas China's policy is to provide loans as to other countries such as Laos and Indonesia, where railways have been built under the BRI. Over the decades, Nepal and China have reached more than three dozen agreements, but none of them have been implemented, mainly due to Nepal's laxity in following them up. The trade and transit treaty, for example, was reached in March 2016 when then prime minister KP Oli had paid a visit to China. Under this treaty, Nepal was supposed get access to four seaports and three dry ports for import and export of goods to and from third countries as well. But this agreement has not come into operation as Nepal has not taken any proactive role to make it functional. Looking at the MoUs, we can say that PM Dahal embarked on a visit to China without doing any proper homework. Market monitoring The biggest festival of the Nepalis is just round the corner, and it is the time when traders try to make quick money by selling substandard goods or at high prices. Year in year out, traders resort to creating artificial shortages of essential foodstuffs like sugar, cooking oil, rice, wheat flour just before the festivals, and jack up prices for no rhyme or reason. Take sugar, for example, which saw prices rise by Rs 20 a kilo last week. The price of rice in the market rose by Rs 300 for a 25-kilo bag after India imposed a ban on export of non-Basmati rice recently, although Nepal imports only about half a million tons of rice, that too much of it Basmati rice. There is thus a need for monitoring the market regularly by government agencies so that consumers are not cheated. Since September 13, the monitoring team of the Department of Commerce, Supplies and Consumer Protection has taken action against 180 firms and fined them anywhere between Rs 5000 and Rs 20,000. But will such action against a few hundred firms deter the businessmen from taking undue advantage of the consumers? The consumer forums too must be active and not leave the monitoring job to the government agencies alone.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/tourism-and-green-investment-for-planet-people-and-prosperity,"Tourism and green investment: For planet, people and prosperity",Jinesh Sindurakar,2023-09-27 09:00:06,"For tourism to return to its former shape and for future growth, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation, UNWTO, has identified investment as the most responsible factor. Departure from the conventional approach of investment and exploring new ways can make tourism a game changer in economic development. Thus, the theme for this year's World Tourism Day is ""Tourism and green investment"", which stresses investment for the planet (by investing in sustainable infrastructure and accelerating green transformation), people (by investing in education and skills, and prosperity (by investing in innovation, technology and entrepreneurship). The Everest region, a major tourist destination, is expected to see a spurt in the number of tourists in the coming season. This increase will also increase the consumption of LPG and kerosene at Base Camp. Experts estimate that 50 cylinders are used every day at Base Camp, which serves Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse, and is visited by around 30,000-40,000 people during the mountaineeringseason. The 2019 National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Everest Expedition concludes that Everest's highest glacier has lost 2,000 years of ice in 30 years. The minimum temperature of Base Camp was -27°C in 2013 whereas it was -23°C in 2022. This is indeed alarming for the most saleable mountain in terms of climbers and income. The requirement at this hour clearly indicates the need for developing infrastructure at Base Camp to prevent unnatural climate change. Using renewable energy like wind power or solar power can displace the increasing use of fossil fuel without compromising the need of energy for expeditions at Base Camp. This might be the only solution to the environment crisis, which we are nearing quickly because of the high consumption of non-renewable energy. The successful execution of this technology will help install green energy technology in other popular mountains like Manaslu and Dhaulagiri. Tourism is our fourth important economic sector in terms of employment generation. The 2021 report of the Central Bureau of Statistics mentions that tourism provided employment to 371,140 people across the country, which is 30.6 per cent of the total employment. The World Bank report of 2022 mentions that tourism contributed 6.7 per cent to our GDP. To attract a million tourists annually would require more qualified and well trained staff in the tourism sector.Preventing the current generation from leaving the country in search of a better future is only possible with the creation of employment opportunities at home. Our geographical location makes it an uphill task to seek a future in trade and industry, making tourism the only sector with the capacity to help develop. The role of the government is essential in producing well-trained human resources and allowing the youth to upgrade their skillsand modify themselves as per the changed environment. In March 2023, 99,426 foreign tourists visited Nepal, which makes the country attractive for international chain hotels to establish themselves in Nepal. But for them to continue coming here, they need to have skilled human resources in the hospitality sector. Another vital factorto which we need to be attentive is foreigners occupying senior-most positions in the hotels. Operating training and academic programmes as per our requirement to produce sufficient number of skilled manpower within a fixed time frame can be supportive in displacing them. It can also prevent the outflow of foreign currency in the form of salary, bonuses and other facilities provided to them. Entrepreneurship plays akey role in the economic prosperity of the society, and it can be achieved only if we start to think outside the box, leaving conventional tools and adapting an innovative approach. Increasing investment in exploring innovative technology can have a compound positive effect on our economy. The development of entrepreneurship depends upon technological innovation as it promotes entrepreneurs who can create new products and services, so necessary for businesses to stay competitive. For example, sending rate, services through fax, telex of the tourism package was a normal practice in the 1970s and 1980s, which changed with the advent of the internet and email in 1990. Afterwards, the development of social media has made it much easier to promote packages covering a greater number of clients. The maximum use of digital marketing in the form of travel websites, social media allows tourists and entrepreneurs in selecting a travel package as per their convenience and budget. Tourism entrepreneurs, who assimilated the changes in technology and innovation, modified their business to survive in the tourism sector while those who failed to adapt disappeared from this sector. Hence, for countries like ours, the government can provide support in the exploration and implementation of innovative ideas to develop entrepreneurship. UNWTO identifies the need of investment in prosperity through financial subsidy, execution of the innovative startup tourism proposal and continuous orientation programmes for the tourism entrepreneur to explore new marketing strategies. The tourism sector to remain as a major economic force and world's leading employer, investment that works for the planet, people and prosperity must be sustainable. Investment in natural resources to avoid a scarcity of these resources for our future generation will help to attain the sustainable development goal. Investment in human resources to train and make them capable to work in the changed environment will develop their entrepreneurship to explore innovative thoughts to bring prosperity in the society.

In the face of this tumult, the theme for this year's General Debate will be ""Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all."" We've updated last year's backgrounder for the 2023 high-level meeting. Here's what to know about this year's U.N. General Assembly, presided over by Trinidad and Tobago's Dennis Francis. WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY? While the effectiveness of the United Nations has been questioned for as long as it has existed, the benefits of attendance are undeniable. From the dais, countries broadcast their agendas, grievances and calls to action to the entire world and for the permanent record. The exercise in multilateralism was born in the wake of World War II, and grounded in the hope for lasting peace. This week is a key chance for countries often drowned out by what they decry as a hegemonic world order to grab the attention of a larger audience. It's also a chance for leaders to engage in meetings on the sidelines in neutral territory. WHO IS COMING TO NEW YORK THIS YEAR? Heads of state and government from at least 145 countries are expected to take the dais at the river's edge. Among them will be Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy - all expected in the first day. This will be Zelenskyy's first in-person appearance at the United Nations since the Russian invasion of his country - in 2022, the General Assembly voted to grant him special dispensation to submit a prerecorded speech. But the parade of speakers will be marked by some key absences: While they're all sending representatives, the leaders of the rest of the permanent U.N. Security Council members - France, the United Kingdom, China and Russia - will not make the trip. The presence of Vladimir Putin would certainly have been surprising, but Emmanuel Macron is a regular attendee and this would have been British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's first opportunity to address the General Assembly. Macron cited King Charles III's imminent visit; Sunak, a busy schedule. Top leaders from other major countries, including India - who just played host to the G20 summit in New Delhi this month - and Mexico, are also slated to send ministers in their steads. WHAT DOES THE GENERAL DEBATE LOOK LIKE? We might be in the midst of U.S. presidential primary debate season, but the structure of the General Debate at the United Nations bears little resemblance. It doesn't lend itself to obvious fireworks - booing or interruptions or immediate rebuttals are not permitted - but that doesn't mean intrigue and drama are absent. Each speech alone offers a rich text and the delivery adds subtext. Speeches can be fonts of evocative language, barbs and gauzily veiled messages. They're supposed to run for 15 minutes, but many miss that mark. Last year, speeches averaged around 19 minutes, drawing a wry chiding from Slovakian President Zuzana Čaputová - clocking in under 12 minutes, her speech ended with: ""And since obeying even the smallest of rules matters, let me finish here to respect the agreed time limit."" The longest speech in history ran to 269 minutes, and was delivered by Cuba's Fidel Castro in 1960. Member states are also allowed to exercise the right of reply, in which they can rebut criticism voiced during the General Debate. These are often fiery exchanges at day's end, but aren't typically delivered by heads of state or heads of government - rather, lower-level members of a country's delegation. Last year, there were 21 exercises of the right of reply. HOW LONG DOES THIS YEAR'S GENERAL DEBATE RUN? It's still six days, as usual, but this year's General Debate ends a day later - Tuesday, Sept. 26. While past General Debates usually ran from Tuesday through Monday, with a break only on Sunday, this year there's a two-day break. A U.N. spokesperson confirmed that there will be no speeches on the usually final Monday in observance of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. WHY DOES BRAZIL SPEAK FIRST AT THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY? It's tradition. Early on, Brazil ventured forward when no other country would volunteer to speak first. Decades later, the South American country retains the pole position. As the host country, the United States typically speaks second (though last year, President Joe Biden had to delay his speech by a day because he was attending Queen Elizabeth II's funeral ). For the scores of speeches that follow, the order is determined by multiple variables, including whom a country is sending to deliver the speech (heads of state precede heads of government, who precede mere ministers and other representatives), countries' own preferences and geographic balance. ARE NON-UN MEMBERS ALLOWED TO ATTEND? Some. While all member states are invited to speak, not all necessarily make avail of the opportunity. But the United Nations also has permanent observers, which have access to ""most meetings and relevant documentation,"" per the UN website. The European Union,Palestine and the Holy See (the Vatican) are permanent observers again on the docket this year. Last year, Palestine had the longest speech, with President Mahmoud Abbas clocking in at more than 47 minutes. HOW DO I KEEP ABREAST OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE UN? You're in the right place.

Briefing the House of Representatives about his visit to America and China, PM Dahal said, ""I have taken it as an important opportunity to participate as head of government in the General Assembly in New York and speak about the issue of Nepal to the international community."" PM Dahal also spoke about his third visit to China and reiterated his belief that bilateral bonding between Nepal and China would strengthen. ""I would like to inform that these visits will benefit Nepal and enhance Nepal-China relations,"" he said. During the visit to China, discussion will be held on cooperation from China in advancing Nepal's infrastructure, agriculture, energy, tourism, health, education and various other areas. He said the areas of mutual cooperation between the two countries would be further expanded. PM Dahal said talks would be held on opening bilateral trade checkpoints and traditional border points between the two countries that were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, lawmakers have suggested that PM Dahal hold discussions about electricity trade, railway, oil and the controversial map released by China. CPN-UML MP Raghuji Pant said the issue of Nepal-China electricity trade should be discussed during the prime minister's China visit. Speaking to media after the HoR meeting, Pant said, ""Since Nepal's electricity trade is dependent on India, it can leverage this to pressurise Nepal. Hence, electricity trade with China should be our priority."" He further said, ""The BRI project should also be taken forward and it would not be appropriate for the prime minister to go to China via the USA. A few more border points should be opened with China."" Nepali Congress MP Ramhari Khatiwada said the prime minister's visit should not affect the country's nationality, national integrity and sovereignty. He said Nepal's territory should also be discussed diplomatically. He expressed belief that the prime minister's visit would solve the problem of oil and railways. ""The prime minister should favour our side without compromising the country's nationality, national integrity and sovereignty. Our relationship with our neighbours should remain neutral. We have suggested that the prime minister work for the benefit of Nepal during his visit. The prime minister should keep Nepal's stance with India and China regarding the issue of our map. We believe that the prime minister will hold discussions to solve the problems of oil and railways with China,"" he said. CPN-MC MP Devendra Paudel said the prime minister would talk about opening a few more Nepal-China border points during his visit. ""When the Chinese President visited Nepal, we signed 20 points which included opening the border, trade and some big projects. The subject of their interest is the BRI project,"" he said. He further said, ""Putting nationality of our country at the centre, important issues will be discussed with the Chinese side to maintain harmonious relations with neighbouring countries and the international community. A decision will be taken only after holding serious discussion on business and cooperation.'' Chief Whip of Rastriya Prajatantra Party Gyan Bahadur Shahi said, ""The prime minister should refrain from visiting China without resolving the issue of the controversial map. He also asked the prime minister to solve the problems of Nepal Airlines as it has yet to get permission to carry passengers in Hong Kong transit."" PM Dahal is leaving for New York tomorrow. He will be leading a Nepali delegation to the US. ""Nepal, Chairing the Global Coordination Bureau of the Least Developed Countries, would present the common concerns and agendas of 47 LDCs,"" PM Dahal informed the Parliament. After addressing the 78th session of the UNGA, PM Dahal will directly travel to Hangzhou in China on September 22. ""I have to go directly to China from New York due to lack of time between the address at UNGA in New York and China,"" he said. He will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Hangzhou. He is also scheduled to meet his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang and hold bilateral talks.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/nc-gen-secy-thapa-lambasts-government,NC Gen Secy Thapa lambasts government,Himalayan News Service,2023-08-30 08:45:37,"KATHMANDU, AUGUST 29 Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa has blasted the government for proposing flawed provisions in the bill to amend some Nepal Acts. Speaking from the rostrum of the House of Representatives today, Thapa said that while the government had the power to introduce bills to amend some Nepal Acts, the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party (NCP)-led government had blatantly violated the privilege. Thapa said that the KP Sharma Oli-led government had bundled provisions related to the Nepal Trust Act under the bill to amend some Nepal Acts. He said the Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Dhanaraj Gurung had joined other Nepali Congress leaders to oppose the Oli government's attempts to amend multiple laws through a single bill. ""If the process to amend the Nepal Acts was wrong at that time, how can it be right this time?"" he wondered. The way this bill has been brought is an insult to the Parliament. It happened during Oli's government, and it is happening now,"" he added. Thapa said that if the government was under the impression that it had a majority in the Parliament, and whatever it brings in the House would be passed by the House, then the government was wrong. ""We will have to show whether we are ready to be dominated by the government,"" Thapa added. The bill's provision relating to Muluki Criminal Code was aimed at giving immunity to people involved in serious offences, and the NC cannot back the bill, he added. ""The Nepali Congress won't accept criminalisation of politics and politicisation of crime,"" he added. He urged the law minister not to continue with the provisions contained in the bill as it was drafted by the Oli government. NC General Secretary Thapa further said that the bill proposed to change the environment laws, allowing the Environment Department to carry out the environment impact assessment which the line ministry and environment experts will not accept. ""Who is behind all this?""' he wondered. Stating that the EIA was also an international document, Thapa said that the EIA should be okayed only by the ministry. He said that the bill also proposed to give the district court jurisdiction over revenue leakage cases, which earlier were under the high court's jurisdiction. ""There is a long list of errors that I have found in this bill, and I will discuss them with the relevant panel. If the PM takes the lawmakers for granted, then he is wrong,"" he said. ""The PM must be ready to face opposition on this bill."" The government had, on May 9, registered the bill to amend some Nepal Acts in the HoR seeking to revise 80 Acts, including laws related to criminal office, environment protection, forest use and university education. In the past, the government would seek to amend multiple acts through a single bill only for minor revisions, but in recent years, successive governments have been introducing such bills even for major changes in multiple Acts through a single bill.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/cash-on-the-money-for-aston-villa-with-two-goals-in-a-3-1-win-at-burnley-in-premier-league,Cash on the money for Aston Villa with two goals in a 3-1 win at Burnley in Premier League,Associated Press,2023-08-27 22:13:29,"LONDON, AUGUST 27 Matty Cash's first goals for Aston Villa in more than a year inspired the team to a 3-1 victory over Burnley in the Premier League on Sunday. The right back came into the starting side as the only unforced change from Villa's 5-0 midweek win over Hibernian in the Europa Conference League playoffs and ensured there was no European hangover for Unai Emery's team by scoring twice in the opening 20 minutes. Lyle Foster gave Burnley hope with a goal two minutes into the second half, but Moussa Diaby - who set up one of Cash's goals - restored Villa's two-goal advantage just after the hour as the visitors ended a five-match winless league run on the road. Burnley built its Championship title-winning campaign on the back of a 21-match unbeaten run at Turf Moor, but has started life back in the Premier League with back-to-back home defeats after losing to Manchester City in the opening round. Cash, playing as a wing back, needed only eight minutes to score, sliding in to poke home Ollie Watkins' cross after John McGinn's lofted ball over the top had left Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford caught in two minds. It was the Poland international's first goal since the final day of the 2021-22 season and there would soon be another with Cash at the heart of a slick passing move. Cutting in from the right to collect Watkins' pass, Cash laid the ball off for Diaby on the right side of the box and then charged into the center to lash home the resulting cross. Burnley looked rusty after the postponement of last weekend's trip to Luton left the team with an enforced rest and was overrun defensively as the chances kept coming. Cash tried a spectacular volley from Lucas Digne's deep cross in the 35th minute but Hannes Delcroix, making his Burnley debut after arriving in midweek from Anderlecht, got in a block to send it over the crossbar. Cash again linked up with Diaby, whose deflected cross found Watkins, but Trafford was in the right place to deny him from point-blank range. Burnley had done little to threaten the goal of Robin Olsen, making his first Premier League start since New Year's Day with Argentina international Emi Martinez sidelined by a calf strain, but things changed immediately at the start of the second half. Johann Berg Gudmundsson, on as a substitute, headed a deep ball back into the box and Foster had the power to hold off Pau Torres and spin to fire beyond Olsen. Burnley was suddenly on top. Sander Berge sent in a cross begging for a touch, then Zeki Amdouni caused panic between Torres and Olsen. More confusion between Olsen and Boubacar Kamara allowed Berge to run into the box, winning a corner from which Olsen did well to deny Delcroix a debut goal. Having coped with the pressure, Villa hit Burnley on the break just after the hour. McGinn shrugged off a shirt pull from Ameen Al-Dakhil to play in Digne, who pulled the ball back for Diaby to find the bottom right corner. The goal survived a VAR check for offside. Watkins should have made it four in the 67th minute when he beat Delcroix to a low cross but Trafford again denied him from close range. Villa started the season with a 5-1 loss at Newcastle before responding by beating Everton 4-0.","the, cross, league, goal, watkins, cash, matty, right, mcginn, digne, premier, villa, burnley, lucas, emery, unai, poland, europa, trafford, minutes"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/saka-sparkles-as-arsenal-opens-epl-season-with-win-newcastle-sends-statement-by-dismantling-villa,Saka sparkles as Arsenal opens EPL season with win. Newcastle sends statement by dismantling Villa,Associated Press,2023-08-13 22:13:52,"LONDON, AUGUST 13 After Arsenal left fans standing in line for an extra 30 minutes to get into the stadium, Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka proved they were worth the wait. Arsenal's two star wingers lit up the opening Saturday of the Premier League season with an audacious assist and a curling long-range strike that helped the team start the campaign with a 2-1 win over Nottingham Forest. Newcastle then sent the biggest statement of the day, with Alexander Isak scoring twice in a 5-1 dismantling of Aston Villa in the late game that showed Eddie Howe's team could be a top-four contender again this season. Jarrod Bowen provided another highlight with a strike similar to Saka's to open the scoring for Bournemouth in a 1-1 draw with West Ham, while Brighton's record signing Joao Pedro scored on his debut in a 4-1 win over newcomer Luton. Everton, on the other hand, couldn't produce any kind of breakthrough despite a slew of chances and paid the price when it conceded a second-half goal to lose 1-0 against visiting Fulham. Crystal Palace beat Sheffield United 1-0 after also scoring in the second half of a game it largely dominated. A day after defending champion Manchester City opened the season with a 3-0 win at promoted Burnley, Arsenal also needed to make a bright start to show it can once again be the main challenger to Pep Guardiola's team. The day got off to an embarrassing start, though, as Arsenal's new digital ticketing system caused a 30-minute delay to the game when it collapsed and tens of thousands of angry fans were unable to get into the stadium in time for the scheduled kickoff. Martinelli made most of them forget all about that mishap with his assist for the opening goal. Taking on two defenders outside the area, the Brazilian produced a quick spin move followed by a backheel flick to Eddie Nketiah in the box, and the Arsenal striker carved out enough space for a shot that took a slight deflection before going past goalkeeper Matt Turner. ""It was a great bit of skill by Martinelli to get through,"" Nketiah said. Saka then produced an even better one just six minutes later. Cutting in from the right, Saka launched a left-footed strike from outside the area that flew into the far corner past the outstretched Turner, the United States international who was making his Forest debut just days after joining the club from Arsenal. ""Definitely one of my better goals,"" said Saka, who scored 14 in the Premier League last season. ""It's one of those where, when it leaves your foot, you sort have a good feeling."" It looked set to be a routine win for Arsenal, until the visitors suddenly found themselves right back in the game. Anthony Elanga launched a quick counter after an Arsenal corner in the 83rd minute and ran the length of the field before squaring to fellow substitute Taiwo Awoniyi, who slotted in from close range. That created a nervy finish, although Forest couldn't test Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale again. NEWCASTLE IMPRESSES Newcastle is entering a season with Champions League soccer for the first time since 2002-03, and judging by Saturday's performance it could well be back in the Premier League's top four this time around. Isak netted one goal in each half after new signing Sandro Tonali had opened the scoring, with Callum Wilson and Harvey Barnes adding late goals. The scoreline could have been even bigger if not for a number of saves by Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez. Villa's day was made even worse by a serious injury to defender Tyrone Mings, who had to be carried off on a stretcher in the 31st. It's yet another blow for Unai Emery's team after midfielder Emiliano Buendia suffered a serious knee injury this week. Villa's marquee summer signing Moussa Diaby had equalized for the visitors in the 11th. NEW FACES, SAME BRIGHTON Brighton was one of the big surprises last season when it finished sixth to qualify for Europe for the first time. Despite losing more key players this offseason, it picked up where it left off against Luton - thanks in part to two newcomers. Pedro became the club's record signing when he joined from Watford and netted his first goal for the club with a penalty in the 71st, after Solly March had given the hosts the lead in the first half. Carlton Morris then converted a penalty for Luton's first Premier League goal, but Simon Adingra - another new signing - capitalized on a big error from Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu to make it 3-1 before fellow substitute Evan Ferguson added the fourth in injury time. EVERTON STRUGGLES UP FRONT Judging by its opening game, Everton still hasn't found a solution to its scoring problems. Sean Dyche's team produced 19 shots but couldn't find a way past Bernd Leno in the Fulham goal, and instead conceded a 73rd-minute goal by Bobby De Cordova-Reid. At Bournemouth, Dominic Solanke scored a late goal to help the hosts salvage a 1-1 draw when he collected a loose ball in the box, rounded goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, and slotted it into the net in the 82nd minute at Vitality Stadium. Bowen had put the Hammers ahead with a left-footed curler from outside the area in the 51st. At the age of 76, Crystal Palace coach Roy Hodgson began his 47th year in management with a win thanks to Odsonne Edouard's goal early in the second half.","the, brighton, goal, minute, arsenal, turner, luton, signing, league, season, villa, eddie, goalkeeper, ramsdale, areola, edouard, alphonse, hodgson, buendia, sandro"

The 22-year-old Timber moved for a fee of 40 million euros ($45 million), Ajax said. It could rise to 45 million euros ($50.5 million) with add-ons. Timber, a ball-playing defender who played for the Netherlands at last year's World Cup in Qatar and was also in the squad for the European Championship in 2021, offers versatility in being able to play at center back or on the right. Arsenal collapsed late in last season's Premier League title race to finish second behind Manchester City after sustaining some injuries in defense. ""We're really excited that Jurrien has joined us,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said. ""He is a versatile young defender who will fit into our system and provide our squad with so much added quality. ""Jurrien is a young player, but has already achieved so much. He has experienced what it's like to go to a major international tournament on more than one occasion, as well as the trophies he has won with Ajax."" Timber, who joined Ajax's academy in 2014, won league titles with the team in 2021 and '22. Arsenal could also announce the signing of England midfielder Declan Rice imminently from West Ham. The club has already brought in Germany forward Kai Havertz from Chelsea this offseason in a deal worth a reported 65 million pounds ($82 million). CHONG TO LUTON Premier League newcomer Luton signed former Manchester United winger Tahith Chong from Birmingham for a reported 4 million pounds ($5.25 million).

United led on Joshua Zirkzee's goal in the 58th minute but the hosts equalized 12 minutes later after Bruno Fernandes' hand ball. Mikel Oyarzabal sent Andre Onana the wrong way from the penalty spot. The Europa League could be a way for United to finish the season with a trophy after crashing out of the FA Cup on Sunday. A spot in the quarterfinals will be on the line at Old Trafford in the second leg next Thursday. ""Our decision-making in the final third was sometimes not the best, but we had good moments,"" United manager Ruben Amorim said. ""It's going to be a different game at Old Trafford and the pressure is going to be on us. We have to be ready."" Tottenham, also struggling in the Premier League, lost 1-0 at AZ Alkmaar. Lucas Bergvall netted an own goal following the first corner kick of the game after former Spurs striker Troy Parrott's attempt across the goal. ""No fault for the goal, it happens,"" Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said. ""It's more about the collective tonight than the individuals. Collectively we were nowhere near the level we needed to be at and that's the thing we need to address."" Tottenham had beaten the Dutch team 1-0 in the league phase at home in October. Rangers took a big step toward the quarterfinals by stunning José Mourinho's Fenerbahce 3-1 in Istanbul. Mourinho won the Europa League with Man United in 2017. Czech forward Václav Černý scored twice and Cyriel Dessers had a goal and an assist for Rangers. Dessers gave them a dream start putting them ahead six minutes into the game. Substitute Alexander Djiku equalized in the 30th off a corner kick after half an hour. Djiku came on early to replace injured Çağlar Söyüncü in the 16th. Černý restored a one-goal advantage for Rangers late in the first half from a tight angle on a counter with Dessers setting him up and added another one nine minutes from time. It was the first game in Europe for Rangers interim coach Barry Ferguson. A Rangers fan died in Istanbul ahead of the match in a road traffic accident overnight. In Bucharest, substitute Malick Fofana scored two late goals to give Lyon a promising advantage after a 3-1 win over FCSB. Lazio topped the league phase and showed its class in a 2-1 victory at Viktoria Plzen despite being reduced to nine men. Lazio midfielder Nicolo Rovella was sent off after his second yellow in the 77th when the score was 1-1 and was followed by Samuel Gigot in stoppage time but Gustav Isaksen still netted the late winner for the Italian favorite. Eldor Shomurodov's stoppage-time winner gave Roma a 2-1 victory over Athletic Bilbao in Rome. Brian Brobbey's header put Ajax 1-0 up against Frankfurt in Amsterdam but the forward deflected Hugo Larsson's shot into his own net and Ellyes Skhiri completed a 2-1 comeback for the 2022 Europa League champion. Bodø/Glimt beat Conference League defending champion Olympiacos 3-0 in Norway. Olympiacos had conceded just three goals in the tournament coming into the game. Chelsea wins in Conference League Chelsea kept a perfect record in the third-tier Conference League with a 2-1 victory at Copenhagen. Reece James and Enzo Fernández gave the London club a 2-0 lead in the second half before Gabriel Pereira reduced the deficit to one. Cole Palmer started for Chelsea, his first appearance in the competition this season. Fiorentina, the runner-up in last two years in the competition, came from two goals down to level at 2-2 against Panathinaikos only 23 minutes into the game in Athens but forward Tetê scored in the 55th to give the hosts a 3-2 victory.

AC Milan was to left rue Theo Hernandez's second yellow card - for diving - as Feyenoord advanced to the Champions League last 16 at the former European champion's expense with a 1-1 draw in the second leg of their playoff on Tuesday, giving the Dutch team a 2-1 win on aggregate. Bayern Munich, Club Brugge and Benfica also won their playoffs, eliminating Celtic, Europa League winner Atalanta, and French team Monaco, respectively. ""In soccer everything changes in a second,"" said Milan forward Santiago Giménez, who scored one of the competition's fastest goals against his former team, Feyenoord, in the first minute. Hernandez was sent off for a dive in the 51st when Milan was dominating after Giménez's opener had leveled the tie. Feyenoord had won the first leg of the playoff 1-0 last week. But Milan's defense looked anything but assured after referee Szymon Marciniak showed Hernandez another yellow card for his dive. The France defender had earned his first before the break for lashing out at a Feyenoord player after a foul on teammate João Félix. Hugo Bueno crossed for Julián Carranza to head Feyenoord level on the night in the 73rd, enough to put the Dutch team into the next phase. ""We're very disappointed. We started well and scored straight away. It seemed like Feyenoord couldn't hurt us,"" Giménez said of the game's pivotal moment. ""Today it happened to Theo but it can happen to anyone, this is soccer. We have the utmost respect for Theo. We will give him all our support."" Feyenoord's Givairo Read was shown a red card following another melee after the final whistle. Feyenoord will play either Inter Milan or Arsenal in the round of 16. Davies to Bayern's rescue Alphonso Davies scored in the fourth minute of stoppage time for Bayern to reach the last 16 with a 1-1 draw against Celtic. Davies, a substitute, bundled the ball over the line after Leon Goretzka's effort was kept out, saving Bayern the ordeal of extra time after German player Nicolas Kühn had scored against his former club to draw Celtic level on aggregate. Davies' goal gave Bayern a 3-2 win over two legs. Next for the Bavarian powerhouse is either Bundesliga rival Bayer Leverkusen or Atlético Madrid. Atalanta's efforts in vain Club Brugge eliminated Atalanta with a 3-1 win in Bergamo for a 5-2 win on aggregate. The 19-year-old forward Chemsdine Talbi scored twice as the visitors gave Gian Piero Gasperini's team a lesson in efficiency. Atalanta had 29 efforts at goal, compared to seven from the visitors, and tried 89 attacks compared to 16 from Brugge. Halftime substitute Ademola Lookman scored seconds after the restart to unleash hopes of a miracle - Atalanta just needed three more goals to level the tie - but Simon Mignolet saved Lookman's penalty in the 61st as those hopes gradually faded.

A German classic. A rare meeting between Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain. The Champions League got more heavyweight clashes when the draw for the round of 16 was made Friday. Defending champion Real Madrid's reward for ousting 2023 title winner Manchester City this week in the knockout playoffs is two city derbies against Atletico Madrid - the team it beat in the final in 2014 and 2016. Diego Simeone is still Atletico's coach a decade later, again facing Carlo Ancelotti who won the 2014 final. Ancelotti later took jobs across Europe before returning to Madrid and winning two more Champions League titles for a competition record five as a coach. Bayern Munich was paired with Bayer Leverkusen - the Bundesliga leader against its defending champion, who played a tight 0-0 draw just last weekend. Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso has never lost to Bayern in six games across three seasons, including three meetings this season. Liverpool was the top-seeded team in the draw after finishing first in the 36-team standings last month but still got a tough assignment as the Premier League leader was paired with No. 15 seed PSG. Liverpool and PSG have never met in knockout games in the Champions League or the old European Cup. Their previous meetings were in the group stage in 2018-19, trading home wins in a season that ended with Liverpool winning its sixth European Cup title. The first-leg games will be played March 4-5, with the return games one week later. Also in the draw, No. 2 seed Barcelona was paired with Benfica - which it beat 5-4 in Lisbon one month ago - Arsenal will face PSV Eindhoven and Inter Milan plays Feyenoord. Feyenoord goes back to San Siro, where it already eliminated AC Milan this week in the knockout playoffs round. All three Italian teams in the playoffs lost, including another exit to a Dutch team when PSV got past Juventus in extra time. Club Brugge, which got into the knockout stage in the 24th and final qualification place, will face Aston Villa, which it already beat in November. Borussia Dortmund will play Lille. The Madrid and German matchups were not possible in the old Champions League format where teams from the same country could not face each other in the round of 16. The new tennis-style seeded bracket allows for those derbies, and for teams to reunite after already playing each other in the league phase of the competition. Friday's draw also put Real Madrid and Liverpool in the same half of the bracket and on a path to meet in the semifinals. Both could have English opponents in the quarterfinals. The Madrid derby winner will face Arsenal or PSV, and if Liverpool eliminates PSG it will face Villa or Brugge.","madrid, league, the, champions, draw, derby, derbies, xabi, bracket, alonso, games, psv, seed, real, psg, european, atletico, leverkusen, knockout, city"

Alphonso Davies finally showed Bayern Munich some love on Tuesday when his goal sent the Bavarian powerhouse into the last 16 of the Champions League. The Canada wing back bundled the ball over the line in the fourth minute of stoppage time for 1-1 draw with Celtic, sparing Bayern the ordeal of extra time in the second leg of the playoff. Bayern won the first leg 2-1 in Glasgow and so progressed 3-2 on aggregate. ""It was instinct,"" Davies said of his goal, just his second in the Champions League. ""I'm happy to get another one."" The 24-year-old Davies, who only recently committed his future to Bayern by signing a new contract through June 2030, kissed the Bayern crest on his jersey and then pointed to it after he scored the goal. It was a gesture that Bayern's powerbrokers might have preferred to have seen sooner as talks on extending the speedy wing back's contract became protracted. Davies' contract was due to expire at the end of this season. Bayern's board member for sport Max Eberl said in March 2024 that the club had made its final offer to Davies, who was also the subject of reported interest from Real Madrid. In the end, Bayern and Davies agreed a new deal reported to be worth some 20 million euros ($21 million) a year to the player. Tuesday's goal will go some way to repaying it. Advancing to the last 16 will bring Bayern another 11 million euros ($11.5 million) in prize money from UEFA. ""That's the Champions League,"" Davies said. ""We played against a strong Celtic team. They play with a lot of intensity. We're happy to go through. It's not easy. We're playing so many games."" Bayern, which will learn Friday whether it faces Bayer Leverkusen or Atlético Madrid in the last 16, next faces high-flying Eintracht Frankfurt at home in the Bundesliga on Sunday.","bayern, davies, contract, the, eberl, munich, max, eintracht, frankfurt, euros, champions, wing, goal, kiss, badge, powerbrokers, league, bavarian, ordeal, madrid"

Milan, Atalanta and Monaco all lose",Associated Press,2025-02-13 22:30:57,"BERLIN, FEBRUARY 13 Bayern Munich looks set to survive the new Champions League playoffs round. AC Milan joined Atalanta and Monaco losing their first-leg games Wednesday. Bayern got high-class strikes from Michael Olise and Harry Kane either side of halftime in a 2-1 win at Scottish champion Celtic. The return game is Tuesday in Munich. ""The (Celtic) fans haven't seen many losses here, especially in Europe, so we appreciate the importance of the game and the victory,"" Bayern coach Vincent Kompany said. Bayern had joined Real Madrid and Manchester City as Champions League title winners in the past five years who surprisingly found themselves in the playoffs because they finished outside the top eight in the new 36-team single standings format. Madrid won 3-2 in Manchester on Tuesday. Feyenoord's goal in a rain-soaked 1-0 win over Milan came in the third minute and relied in France goalkeeper Mike Maignan spilling Igor Paixão's shot into the net. Feyenoord's Brazilian winger gave Milan new signing Kyle Walker a tough first game in the competition for the seven-time European champion. It also was a quick winning start for Feyenoord's interim coach Pascal Bosschaart in his first game after the firing Monday of Brian Priske. Benfica won 1-0 at Monaco with another goal from Vangélis Pavlídis, a delicate chip shot in the 48th. Monaco had Al Musrati sent off four minutes later. Club Brugge scored with a disputed penalty kick in stoppage time to beat Atalanta 2-1. That was a meeting of teams that finished 24th and ninth, respectively, in the 36-team standings two weeks ago. The top eight teams in those standings advanced direct to the round of 16 in March, leaving Nos. 9 to 24 to compete this month for eight more entries in playoffs over back-to-back midweeks. Kane vs Schmeichel Harry Kane loves scoring against Kasper Schmeichel, his longtime rival in Tottenham vs Leicester and England vs Denmark games. Bayern star Kane's sharp volley in the 49th, when left unmarked at the back post at a corner, was his 19th career goal past Schmeichel, more than any other goalkeeper he has faced. It was a second impressive goal conceded by Schmeichel, who was helpless against Michael Olise's rising left-footed shot in the 45th. On a tough evening for Celtic's all-American central defense of Cameron Carter-Vickers and Auston Trusty, the Scottish champion has more hope next Tuesday thanks to Japan forward Daizen Maeda cutting the deficit late on. ""At 2-1, Bayern are hanging on,"" Celtic coach Brendan Rodgers said. ""Let's go and have no regrets and see where it takes us. We've shown we can play football and be a threat."" Pavlídis hot streak Benfica's Greece forward might be the most in-form striker in the Champions League. It is now six goals in the competition and five in the past three games including a hat trick against Barcelona. The 26-year-old Pavlidis latched onto a pass from the halfway line and shrugged off defender Mohammed Salisu before neatly clipping the ball over goalkeeper Radoslaw Majecki in the 48th minute. Benfica's win was soured by another injury for veteran winger Angel Di Maria. The 2022 World Cup winner with Argentina lasted 20 minutes as a substitute before sustaining a left hamstring injury. He pulled up near the penalty area and immediately lay on the ground. It was Benfica's second win in Monaco, adding to a 3-2 victory in November in the league phase. Atalanta anger in Brugge A late light-touch clash between two Sweden teammates was decisive in Club Brugge's 2-1 win over Atalanta. Entering stoppage time, Atalanta defender Isak Hien was judged to have raised a hand into the face of Brugge forward Gustaf Nilsson as they chased a loose ball. Turkish referee Umut Meler awarded a penalty and showed yellow cards to three Atalanta players, including Hien, for protesting before Nilsson won the game. He sent goalkeeper Rui Patricio the wrong way with his spot kick. ""We are now going in a direction outside of what football should be,"" Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini told broadcaster Sky Italia of the penalty decision, ""but beyond the controversy we now have to accept these rules that I no longer recognize."" Brugge had led on former Barcelona forward Ferran Jutglà's shot in the 15th minute and Atalanta leveled in the 41st on Mario Pašalić's header.","atalanta, the, celtic, league, champions, goalkeeper, penalty, benfica, feyenoord, meler, rui, hien, umut, radoslaw, italia, majecki, salisu, pašalić, rodgers, patricio"

Manchester City just keep on making the same mistakes. Jude Bellingham's stoppage-time goal sealed a stunning comeback for Madrid and a 3-2 lead in its Champions League playoff against City. In six frantic minutes at the end of a breathless first leg Tuesday, the Spanish giant scored twice to take a precious advantage into next week's match at the Bernabeu. City led 2-1 after 80 minutes at the Etihad Stadium through goals in each half from Erling Haaland. But Brahim Diaz and then Bellingham silenced the home crowd and extend a sorry record for City that has seen it concede seven goals in the last 15 minutes of Champions League games this season. ""We need to see games out better, that's for sure,"" City defender John Stones said. ""We have to stay positive, which is difficult right now."" Bellingham slid in to convert Vinicius Junior's lobbed pass in the second minute of added time to bring back memories of Madrid's dramatic comeback against City in the semifinal in 2022. Then it was Rodrygo who scored twice from the 90th and Madrid eventually sent Pep Guardiola's team crashing out in extra time. At least City has a chance to salvage the tie in the second leg, but the sense of deflation was clear after such a late collapse. ""It's not the first time, unfortunately, it happened many times and that's why it's difficult,"" Guardiola said. ""I've been here for many years and we have been an extraordinary team. ""But in the moment I'm not able... I'm not good enough, you know, to give something to (give) composure to the team, to (know) how to manage the situations."" It was another thrilling, white knuckle-ride of a game between these two giants of European soccer and a one-goal advantage for Madrid means there is still all to play for. Defeat ended City's 35-game unbeaten run at home in the Champions League, dating back to 2018. City led through Haaland's goal in the 19th. By that stage, Madrid had seen a penalty overturned for offside and a Ferland Mendy goalbound effort blocked by Manuel Akanji. Vinicius Junior then hit the bar with a curling shot and Akanji also clipped the frame of the goal with a header. Haaland hit the bar again less than a minute into the second half. Madrid's equalized on the hour through a freakish goal from Mbappe when his miskicked volley wrongfooted Ederson and looped softly over the line. Mbappe hit the post with another chance before Ceballos brought Phil Foden down just inside the box and Haaland's penalty restored City's lead. On came former City academy player Diaz, who left City for Madrid in 2019 and he leveled the game again before Bellingham's winner. ""I don't care what form City are in they are still an unbelievable team and so difficult to play against, they way they move you and manipulate your position,"" Bellingham said. ""It's always really tricky to play against them and in the end we took one of the many chances finally and made it count."" Paris Saint-Germain took a big step toward the round of 16 by beating Brest 3-0 and Juventus won 2-1 against PSV Eindhoven. Borussia Dortmund also looks on course for the next round after a 3-0 win at Sporting Lisbon. Perfect 10 Ousmane Dembélé struck twice for PSG to extend his scoring streak to 10 games in a row. His outstanding form as has seen him score 18 goals during that run. It was his shot that led to PSG taking the lead through a 21st-minute penalty after Pierre Lees-Melou handled in the area. Vitinha converted the spot kick. Dembélé scored his first in the 45th when he broke free down the right and curled a shot inside the post. His second came in the 66th when he pounced on a loose ball and burst into the penalty area to score his 23rd goal of the season. Having made hard work of the new-look league phase of the tournament, it would take a major upset in the second leg in Paris to deny PSG a place in the next round. Juventus leads Substitute Samuel Mbangula grabbed a late winner for Juventus and in doing so claimed his first Champions League goal. The 21-year-old Belgian forward reacted quickly when goalkeeper Walter Benitez spilled a low cross from the right by Francisco Conceição in the 82nd. Juventus took the lead late in the first half from Weston McKennie's powerful strike into the top corner from just inside the penalty area. Veteran midfielder Ivan Perisic calmed the home fans with a fine finish in the 56th. Dortmund wins Serhou Guirassy scored his 10th Champions League goal of the season as last year's runner-up Borussia Dortmund beat Sporting Lisbon 3-0. Guirassy scored one goal and set up another for Pascal Gross as Dortmund scored twice in the space of eight minutes, both goals coming from crosses. Karim Adeyemi finished off a rapid counterattack to score Dortmund's third in the 82nd as Sporting tried to get back into the game and left space at the back. Sporting hasn't won in five Champions League games since coach Ruben Amorim left for Manchester United in November. It was the first Champions League game for new Dortmund coach Niko Kovac.","the, league, champions, goal, city, vinicius, minute, junior, bellingham, penalty, madrid, dortmund, kovac, perisic, benitez, manchester, haaland, weston, mckennie, minutes"

The giants are meeting in the two-legged playoffs after struggling in the new-look league phase of the competition. This is the fourth year in a row they have faced each other in the Champions League, with the winner on the three previous occasions going on to lift the trophy. City heads into the first leg in the middle of a disappointing campaign that has seen their Premier League title defense unravel. But Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti still believes his team will have to overcome one of the best in the world to advance to the round of 16. ""They are one of the best teams in Europe and they have the best manager (Pep Guardiola) out there. It's a nightmare preparing for games against him because he always has ideas that make you think,"" Ancelotti said. ""I am convinced the team that goes through from this tie will go on to win the competition."" Guardiola said he did not know what to expect from his team after a troubled season has left it in fifth place in the Premier League, 15 points behind leader Liverpool. ""We've not been consistent, when what's defined the team over the last decade has been we are an incredible machine every three days, otherwise we cannot win six Premier Leagues in seven years or win the incredible trophies we have won,"" he said.

Robert Lewandowski, Fermín López, Raphinha and Eric García scored a goal each as Barcelona took advantage of the 1-1 draw between Madrid and Atletico in the capital derby on Saturday. Third-placed Barcelona is now two points behind leader Madrid and one point behind Atletico. Barcelona had a comfortable away win despite playing with 10 men from the 62nd when López was sent off for a hard foul. The red card was shown after a video review. It was the third straight league win for Barcelona, and its ninth victory in 11 matches across all competitions. Sevilla, in 13th place, has won only one of its last five league games. Lewandowski put Barcelona ahead in the seventh minute with his eighth goal in his last nine games in all competitions. Ruben Vargas equalized a minute later for the hosts before López put Barcelona back in front in the 46th. Raphinha added to the lead in the 55th and García sealed the win in the 89th.

If the Australians win or draw the match they will regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy for the first time since 2014-15. A win by India and a drawn series at 2-2 would allow the visitors to retain the trophy for a record-extending fifth consecutive time, But more importantly for Australia, a win at the SCG would book the team's spot in a second consecutive World Test Championship final. Australia beat India in the 2023 decider. South Africa became the first team to qualify for the WTC final at Lord's in June by winning a dramatic match at home to Pakistan last weekend. On Thursday, Australia allrounder Mitch Marsh was dropped for the final match against India, giving Beau Webster a test debut. Fast bowler Mitchell Starc was also named despite dealing with rib soreness at the Melbourne Cricket Ground during Australia's 184-run win ending Monday to take a 2-1 series lead. The 34-year-old Starc had scans on Wednesday and received the all-clear to take his spot in a bowling lineup with captain captain Pat Cummins, Scott Boland, and Nathan Lyon. Marsh had only been called upon for 13 overs in the past three tests, with his pace appearing well down while not taking a wicket. Debuting in 2014, Marsh has played 46 tests for a batting average of 28.53, highlighted by three Ashes centuries. His bowling was also strong at the start of his career, with 51 wickets at an average of 40.41. ""'Mitchy' obviously hasn't quite got the runs, and perhaps wickets this series,"" Cummins said Thursday. ""So we felt like it was time for a freshen up and Beau's been great. It's a shame for Mitchy, because we know how much he brings to the team, but feel like now it's a good week for Beau (Webster) to get a chance."" Webster has averaged 57.1 in first-class cricket since March 2022, while also picking up 81 wickets at 31.7. Last year, the 31-year-old Webster became the first player since West Indian legend Garfield Sobers in 1963-64 to score 900 runs and take 30 wickets in a Sheffield Shield domestic season in Australia. For India, coach Gautam Gambhir refused to guarantee that captain Rohit Sharma would play in the Sydney test. Gambhir confirmed Thursday that fast bowler Akash Deep would miss the test with a back injury, in one guaranteed change. Sharma has failed to score more than 10 runs in any of his five innings in the series. Asked directly whether Sharma would play, Gambhir said: ""We are going to have a look at the wicket and announce our playing XI tomorrow."" Asked again if he could guarantee the opener's spot, Gambhir responded: ""The answer remains the same.""

After Australia's tail wagged with the bat for a little longer to reach 445 all out early on Monday, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood quickly had India in trouble with a devastating opening spell at the Gabba. Starc (2-25) took the wickets of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill in his first two overs to set the tone, before Hazlewood (1-17) captured the prize wicket of Virat Kohli just before one of many passing rain showers brought on an early lunch with India at 22-3. After removing Jaiswal (4) with the first ball of the innings in the second test at Adelaide, Starc needed just two balls at the Gabba to remove the tourist's opener. The first ball was swiped through gully for a boundary by the 22-year-old but the second he chipped a simple catch to Mitch Marsh at midwicket for a soft dismissal. In his next over, Starc struck again with Marsh diving acrobatically to take a two-handed catch at gully to remove Shubman Gill (1) and India was 7-2. Hazlewood, back in the team after a side strain ruled him out of last week's second test, then rocked India further by teasing an edge from the veteran Kohli to have India three down as rain began to fall and prompted an early lunch. On the resumption, skipper Pat Cummins (1-7) got his first wicket by removing Rishabh Pant caught behind to reduce India to 44-4. Captain Rohit Sharma came out to join KL Rahul but there was only time for a superb cover dive boundary for the latter before another passing shower forced players from the field. The rest of the afternoon saw the weather look to clear but just as play appeared set to resume another passing rain shower would cross over the arena. Play finally resumed at about 5:05 p.m. but only 17 more balls were bowled for three runs, before another passing shower and deteriorating light forced the end of the day's play. Australia now has two days of play remaining, weather permitting, and it's path to a possible victory would seem to be contingent on bowling India out for 245 or less in the first innings and enforce the follow on. ""We've got six wickets to take first,"" Marsh said after play. ""We know we have to take 20 wickets to try and win this test. All our conversations and planning will be how do we do that. ""Hopefully the weather holds off, and tomorrow is coming in, having a crack, and seeing where we get to."" The hosts had resumed Monday at 405-7 and some big hitting by Starc and Alex Carey lifted Australia to 445. Carey was the final wicket to fall, holing out in the deep for an enterprising 70 off 88 balls - his ninth test half century. Jasprit Bumrah added one more wicket to return figures of 6-76, having completed his 12th five-wicket haul in tests the day before to again shoulder the load for India's bowlers. ""We have 11 players, I don't look at it that I have to do extra,"" Bumrah said. ""We are a new team, a lot of new players have come into the side and we have to look at it that they will learn from the experience."" On Sunday's Day 2, Travis Head made a sparkling 152 and Steven Smith completed a long overdue 101, as part of a 241-run stand, to lift Australia to 405-7 at the close after it was a precarious 75-3 earlier in the day. Rain prevented all but 13.2 overs on the opening day Friday after India captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and elected to bowl on a green tinged Gabba wicket. India won the first test by 295 runs at Perth, while Australia came back to win the second day-night test in Adelaide by 10 wickets.","the, day, test, shower, passing, wicket, rain, gabba, wickets, rohit, marsh, first, cummins, opening, players, pat, australia, balls, overs, runs"

Stokes strained his left hamstring while bowling on the third day and could not take the field as England was bowled out for 234 as it chased an impossible target of 658 for victory. New Zealand's winning margin matched its largest test win by runs of a 423-run win over Sri Lanka in 2018 and prevented England from completing a series whitewash. England had an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series after winning the first test by eight wickets and the second by 323 runs. ""You can't fault any of the energies or efforts we put into this game, particularly in the field,"" Stokes said. ""It's obviously not ideal to end the tour on this note but we've come here against a New Zealand team which is very strong and full of confidence after beating India in India 3-0. So to come here and lift that trophy at the end proves we played some very good cricket."" England resumed its second innings Tuesday at 18-2 after losing the wickets of Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley late on day three after New Zealand, leading by 204 on the first innings, was dismissed for 453. Joe Root made 54 and Jacob Bethell 76 in a 104-run partnership for the third wicket which briefly fanned England's hopes that it might somehow endure for two full days to draw the match. But dogged perseverance is not a feature of England cricket in the ""Bazball"" quick-scoring era and instead it maintained a policy of all-out attack before the final wicket fell midway through the second session. After lunch Gus Atkinson blasted 43 from 41 balls with seven fours and a six and Ollie Pope made 17 but wickets fell steadily and the result became inevitable. ""I think anytime you finish a series with a win when you've been behind is pleasing,"" New Zealand captain Tom Latham said. ""We weren't at our best in those first two games but the way we came here on a wicket that was slightly different to the first couple and we adapted was very pleasing."" New Zealand's win owed a great deal to the contribution of Mitchell Santner in the first innings who made 76 batting at No. 8 and worked with Matt Henry, Tim Southee and Will O'Rourke to add 116 runs for New Zealand's three wickets. That allowed New Zealand to reach 347 after losing the toss and being sent in. Santner's last-wicket stand with O'Rourke which lasted 77 minutes at the end of the first day and the start of the second was a display of resilience which had been missing from New Zealand's performances in the first two tests. Santner then took 3-7 while New Zealand's presumptive new-ball pairing of Henry and O'Rourke shared seven wickets as England was bowled out for 143 in a session and a half in its first innings. Southee has been the spearhead of New Zealand's attack for many years, mostly in combination with Trent Boult. But this was his 107th and final test before his retirement from international cricket and Boult no longer is contracted by New Zealand Cricket. That means Henry and O'Rourke likely will share the new ball from now on in a New Zealand pace attack which will be strengthened when Kyle Jamieson returns from a back injury. Kane Williamson scored 156, his 33rd test century and his fifth in consecutive tests in Hamilton, to anchor New Zealand's second innings of 453 in which Will Young and Daryl Mitchell both made 60 and Santner made 49. Santner took 4-85 in the second innings. Brook was named Player of the Series for his centuries in the first two tests which were vital in turning those matches in England's favor. He scored 171 in the first test and 123 in the second, both at times when England had lost early wickets. ""I'm still trying to enjoy my cricket, work hard and get better every day,"" Brook said.","zealand, new, the, cricket, 423, test, series, innings, wickets, first, ben, wicket, hamilton, day, santner, latham, second, win, hamstring, stokes"

To compound an already dimsal day for the tourists, England captain Ben Stokes limped from the field with a recurrence of a hamstring injury. Williamson's 33rd test century was his seventh at Seddon Park and his fifth in consecutive tests on a home ground on which he averages more than 100. New Zealand finally was dismissed for 453 after leading by 204 on the first innings and in five overs before stumps England slumped to 18-2. Tim Southee bowled Ben Duckett (4) off an inside edge in the second over of the England innings as the opener charged the veteran seamer who is playing his final test. Zac Crawley (5) was dismissed by Matt Henry for the sixth time in the series, trapped lbw one over before stumps. Jacob Bethell 9 not out and Joe Root had yet to score were at the crease at the close. ""Whenever you take a wicket for New Zealand it's special,"" said Southee who now has 390 test wickets. ""Playing for New Zealand has been such a big part of my life and it's been such an honor to do what I've been able to do. ""Hopefully the next couple of days will be a good couple of days but an emotional couple of days too."" Stokes was bowling the second ball of his 13th over when, on his follow-through, he clutched at the hamstring of his left leg. He immediately walked from the field with his hand covering the lower half of his face on which was etched both pain and distress. Stokes suffered a serious injury to his left hamstring while playing in The Hundred in August for the Northern Superchargers against the Manchester Originals. He was on crutches for some time and forced to miss England's test series against Sri Lanka and the first test of the subsequent series against Pakistan. Ollie Pope took over the captaincy in Stokes' absence. During his six-hour innings, Williamson overtook South Africa's Graeme Smith to move up to 17th place on the list of leading test run-scorers six behind another South African, Hashim Amla. He shared partnerships on Monday of 107 with Rachin Ravindra (44) and 92 with Daryl Mitchell (60). His century came from 137 balls and his 150 from 196 balls, the third 50 from 59 runs as New Zealand stepped up its scoring towards an expected declaration. The entire first session on the third day was lost to rain and a damp outfield. Play resumed at 1.30 with New Zealand 136-3, Williamson 50 not out and Ravindra 2. Williamson scored fluently throughout the day, hitting 14 fours and a six in his century. He was typically powerful square of the wicket, particularly in his use of the cut shot. Ravindra was sometimes bogged down, at the start of the day when he added only a handful of runs in the first hour and later when he found his scoring options limited. At times England bowled to a 7-2 offside field which plugged some scoring zones. With wide gaps on the leg side, Ravindra tried to drag a ball from Matthew Potts outside his off stump through mid-wicket but edged it from the outside half of the bat to Brydon Carse at mid-off. Mitchell joined Williamson and batted with more urgency which seemed an indication of an impending declaration. He hit two sixes and seven fours in his 60 from 84 balls before holing out to Matthew Potts in the deep to give Jacob Bethell his first test wicket. New Zealand had a 500 run lead by 4.55pm on a day when play could go on until 7.30pm, under lights if necessary, because of the loss of the morning session. It led by 600 at 6.10pm but no declaration came. England took the second new ball after 93.4 overs when the lead was 604 and put in the hands of off-spinner Shoaib Bashir who took 2-170, the most expensive bowling figures against New Zealand. Mitchell Santner took 16 runs from the first over bowled by Joe Root and was out in the same over for 49. That brought Southee to the crease for his final innings in his 107th and last test, needing two sixes to become the fourth player after Stokes, England coach and former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum and Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist to hit 100 sixes in tests. He was welcomed by a guard of honor of England players but made only 2 as the New Zealand innings ended with wicketkeeper Tom Blundell 44 not out. The highest winning fourth innings total in test history is 418.","the, test, his, innings, couple, england, hamstring, declaration, stokes, gilchrist, graeme, mccullum, brendon, ben, scoring, blundell, zealand, day, adam, bashir"

Joe Root completed his 36th century as England batted for less than 30 minutes in the morning before declaring with a lead of 582 runs and New Zealand crumbled under the weight of the deficit and was all out for 259 in its second innings England's win followed its comprehensive eight wicket win in the first test at Christchurch, capping its first series victory in New Zealand since 2008 ahead of the final test in Hamilton which begins on Saturday. The third day differed from the first two in Wellington which were warm and sunny. It was cool, gloomy and windy but otherwise England's thorough command of the series continued. Root resumed on 73 with England already 533 ahead. He sped to his century from 127 balls with 10 boundaries and then was out for 106 at which point Ben Stokes declared England's second innings at 427-6. Stokes left himself high and dry at 49 not out, just short of his 49th half century. Chris Woakes had the job at first of bowling into the Wellington wind and he was rewarded with the wickets of Devon Conway (0) and Kane Williamson (4) as New Zealand slumped to 59-4 by lunch. Brydon Carse removed captain Tom Latham (24) and Rachin Ravindra (6) before the break to lift his tally of wickets for the series to 16 at an average of 12.8. New Zealand showed more resistance in the afternoon and evening as wicketkeeper Tom Blundell, under pressure to hold his place, compiled his fifth test century from 96 balls. Blundell put on 94-run partnership with Nathan Smith which saw England having to chase leather for the first extended period in the series. He was out for 115 which included 13 fours and five sixes and Smith followed for a career-bet 42 just before the end. Carse and Harry Brook have been in the engine room for England throughout the series. Brook's 171 at Hagley Oval in the first test and Carse's 10-106 - his 4-64 in the first innings and 6-42 in the second - propelled England's to its emphatic win. Brook then scored 123 from only 115 balls in the first innings at Wellington to lead England's recovery from 43-4 to 280. ""It's amazing to be stood here winning the series and particularly after being 40-4 on day one and I think looking back to the start of this game I think that's a huge reason why we have (won),"" Stokes said. ""Harry Brook and Ollie Pope were just amazing on day one to play like that. That wicket in cricket terms was what we call a snake pit. Especially on day one it was doing plenty and providing a lot of assistance for the bowlers."" ""To have the bravery and the backing of your own ability and to also have the skill to go out and play like that was just absolutely phenomenal."" Carse took 4-46 and Gus Atkinson took 4-31 including a hat-trick as New Zealand was bowled out for 125, giving England a lead of 155. Atkinson took the last three New Zealand wickets to become the first England bowler since Moeen Ali in 2017 to compete a test hat-trick. England's second innings of 427-6 in the second innings included contributions of 96 by Jacob Bethell - out just short of a maiden century - 92 by Ben Duckett, 55 by Brook and then Root's 106. Brook has scored 349 runs in the series so far at an average of 116 and now has three centuries and three half centuries in four tests against New Zealand. After a stunning 3-0 series win away in India last month, New Zealand has slumped in this series, particularly with the bat and changes may be considered before the final test. ""We're obviously hurting,"" Latham said. ""It's disappointing to lose in that fashion. ""I think after the first innings, putting them under pressure, Harry Brook played a fantastic innings there. Obviously when you only score 125 in the first innings you're on the back foot. It hurts and it's not our best.""","the, wellington, england, test, tom, series, innings, century, 323, blundell, 115, latham, second, win, balls, hat, lead, trick, runs, first"

Brook's fast-paced innings of 123 included a century from 91 balls and set the tempo of a day on which 346 runs were scored and 15 wickets fell. New Zealand finished in trouble at 86-5 in reply to England's 280, having lost Devon Conway, Tom Latham, Rachin Ravindar, Kane Williamson and Daryl Mitchell before stumps. Tom Blundell was 6 not out and nightwatchman Will O'Rourke was unbeaten on 0. Williamson appeared typically solid until he was caught by wicketkeeper Ollie Pope from the bowling of Brydon Carse for 37. Carse had bowled Williamson when he was 20 only to be denied when replays showed he had over-stepped. Brook made the difference in the first test which England won by eight wickets, going to the crease at 45-3 and making 171 to deliver a commanding first-innings lead. On Friday he strode out onto the Basin Reserve with England at 26-3 after New Zealand's seamers had dominated the first hour. He left in the last over before tea, run out after having hit five giant sixes and 74 runs from boundaries. England was 259-7 when Brook was out and, gradually losing momentum after his departure, was finally all out in 53.4 overs. The tourists would have hoped for more but it was a reasonable effort on a lively pitch and after being 43-4 after an hour. Brook helped England loosen New Zealand's strong early grip on the match and his innings was put in perspective by New Zealand's struggles on a drying pitch in the last hour. He took three runs from the first nine balls he faced in deference to England's precarious position when he went to the crease. Matt Henry had taken two wickets in his first four overs, all of which were maidens, as the ball seamed sharply on a greenish pitch. Ben Duckett was caught by Latham at second slip in Henry's second over and Zak Crawley, who had opened the England innings at reckless pace hitting a six from the last ball of the first over, was bowled for 17 when England was 21-2. Joe Root was out with the total only 26, brilliantly caught by Mitchell at second slip from the bowling of Nathan Smith, then Jacob Bethell (16) fell to Smith with the total 43. As he did in Christchurch a week ago, and at the Basin Reserve in February 2023 when he made 186, Brook seized control of a test against New Zealand. At the end of his innings Friday, Brook had scored 437 runs against New Zealand in only six test innings at an average of 72.8. He worked his way cautiously, with a single boundary, to 10 runs from 17 balls and then it began: he sent the 19th ball he faced soaring over extra cover, over the embankment fence and out into the street. There was another six and five fours in his half century from 37 balls and he found a like-minded partner in Pope, with whom he rushed to a half-century partnership from 37 balls and century stand from 97 deliveries. Four of Brook's sixes were lofted over cover or extra cover, including one from the bowling of spinner Glenn Phillips who hopefully shouted ""catch"" before turning to see the ball disappear into the street. Pope made 66, including a half century from 65 balls, before he was caught by Ravindra from the bowling of O'Rourke at the end of a partnership which produced 174 runs in just over 36 overs. Brook had played at missed at times, as did all batters on a seaming pitch. But he looked impregnable, reaching 123 from 115 balls in 194 minutes, when he finally was run out from a direct throw in the 53rd over. Smith finished with 4-86, O'Rourke took 3-49 and Henry, who was the best of New Zealand's bowlers, ended with 2-43. Carse had 2-28 at stumps after taking 10-106 in the first test.","zealand, century, balls, test, brook, runs, innings, pitch, new, the, bethell, first, phillips, jacob, hour, glenn, tom, overs, ollie, pope"

After Jordan Cox broke his thumb ahead of the series opener in Christchurch last week, Ollie Robinson was called up as wicketkeeping cover and was in contention to make his first international appearance in the second test at Wellington's Basin Reserve. However, England kept faith with the same team that won by eight wickets on the fourth afternoon of the first test at Hagley Oval, meaning Pope retained the gloves and Jacob Bethell stayed at No. 3. Pope was solid behind the stumps and hit 77 after moving down to No. 6 in the batting order. Bethell was also impressive on his debut, hitting 50 not out in the second innings. ""They always say when you don't notice a keeper, he's done a good job and Ollie certainly did that,"" England fast bowler Chris Woakes said. ""To step up at short notice like that and do the job he did was fantastic.

Resuming on the fourth day with only a four run lead and four wickets in hand, New Zealand managed to bat through all the first session thanks to Daryl Mitchell who made 84 as a lone rearguard and was the last man out. Playing in just his third test, Brydon Carse took 6-42 for match figures of 10-196 as New Zealand was bowled out for 252 in its second innings, leaving England needing only 104 runs to win. New Zealand managed to claim the wicket of Zak Crawley (1) in the second over of England's innings, then Ben Duckett when the tourists were was 55-2 to create a little suspense before the end. But Jacob Bethell who made an unbeaten 50 from 37 balls, his first half century in his debut test, and Joe Root, who scored 23 after a first innings duck, saw England to 104-2 in only 12.4 overs at a run rate of over eight runs per over. The victory came with more than a day and a half to spare. England's win was made possible by Harry Brook whose innings of 171 in partnerships of 151 with Ollie Pope (77) and 159 with Ben Stokes (88) propelled England to 499 in its first innings in reply to New Zealand's 348, a lead of 151. Carse had three wickets by the end of the third day and took three more Sunday to become the first Englishman since Monty Panesar in 2012 to take 10 wickets in a test overseas. ""Of course I'm very proud of the outcome today and to be able to win as a team is very satisfying,"" Carse said. ""I think we were thrown different challenges throughout the game but I think as a group we stuck to certain plans and we got our rewards during the game."" In a moment of concern for England, captain Ben Stokes completed 6.3 overs during New Zealand's second innings and was unable to continue, calling on Gus Atkinson to complete his seventh over. Stokes remained on the field for the remainder of the innings and showed no obvious sign of injury, though he recently had to overcome a hamstring strain. ""We're very happy with the way we performed through the whole week,"" Stokes said. ""We got put under pressure on day two. We were 40-3 and to go on and get a big first innings score and a pretty likeable lead was very nice. ""I thought our bowlers were pretty relentless the whole time."" England was in a strong position from the first day when, after winning the toss, it had New Zealand 319-5 at stumps on a pitch at Hagley Oval which offered pace and bounce on all four days. Kane Williamson held the New Zealand innings together with 93 while Tom Lathan (47) and Rachin Ravindra made solid starts but didn't go on. Young off-spinner Shoaib Bashir took 4-69, bowling 20 overs in an unusually heavy workload for a spinner on the first day at Hagley Park. On day two, Glenn Phillips completed a half century and finished 58 not out as New Zealand reached 348. New Zealand removed Zak Crawley early but Ben Duckett made 46 at a brisk pace to set the tone for England's first innings which was driven by Brook's 171, his seventh test century. England also was helped to its commanding position by New Zealand's poor catching. It dropped seven catches, including Brook on five occasions, at 17, 41, 70, 112 and 132. ""If we isolate the first two innings, being put in on that sort of surface and to be in the position we were, we were happy with that,"" New Zealand captain Tom Latham said. ""The position we had them in, we had our opportunities. If catches go to hand things could have been different."" Using Bazball principles, England added 180 in 33 overs on the third day at almost six per over. New Zealand then slumped to 64-3 early in its second innings, losing Devon Conway, Latham and Ravindra cheaply. Williamson made 61, compiling half centuries in both innings for the 10th time in his career. But New Zealand was 155-6 at stumps on day three and while Mitchell's gallant effort on the last day was impressive, it ultimately came in a lost cause.

Sri Lanka was set an improbable 516 target and started the fourth day in a deep hole at 103-5. It was all out for 282, hastened by the dismissal of Dinesh Chandimal, who led the resistance with 83. After Chandimal was out caught and bowled by Gerald Coetzee, Sri Lanka's last three wickets folded for 11 runs in the next six overs. Jansen, the 2.06-meter left-armer, took the last two wickets for 4-73 in the innings and 11-86 in the match for his maiden 10-for in his 14th test. ""The conditions were favorable for seamers,"" Proteas captain Temba Bavuma said. ""We were confident that if they could put us in trouble, we could do so. Batting always felt tricky, you never felt in."" South Africa, trying to reach its first World Test Championship final, moved up to second on the table, behind India and above Australia. The Proteas are unbeaten in seven tests since February, winning six. ""The conversation (about the WTC) has been there, we are not too loud about it. It will come,"" Bavuma said. ""Our focus needs to be more internally, what we have been doing as a team and control that, let whatever happens happen."" The second and last test against Sri Lanka starts on Thursday in Gqeberha. Sri Lanka was fighting uphill in Durban from the time it was out for a record-low 42 on Thursday. The odds favored the visitor's second innings ending before lunch on Saturday. But the 10th wicket wasn't taken until about an hour afterward. Only one wicket fell in the morning. Chandimal and captain Dhananjaya de Silva resisted at four runs an over. De Silva started on zero and 29 runs behind Chandimal, and caught up to his partner by mid-morning, notching his 50 in the next over. De Silva couldn't believe it when their 95-run stand ended. He tried turning spinner Keshav Maharaj and chipped the ball instead straight to Tristan Stubbs at midwicket. The captain scored 59 off 81, 42 of those runs to the boundary or beyond. Chandimal fell next. To his 174th delivery, he gave a leading edge back to the bowler Coetzee. His patient 83 included a dozen boundaries. Kusal Mendis lashed out with nine boundaries in his 48 and was the game's 10th wicket for Jansen, who came round the wicket and induced an edge behind. Asitha Fernando was the last man out, bowled by Jansen. ""Never thought I would get 10 wickets (in a match),"" Jansen said. ""It is a dream and that is what we work for.""

Medium pacer Megan Schutt picked 3-12 in four overs, while left-arm spinner Sophie Molineux took 2-20, as Sri Lanka was restricted to 93-7 in 20 overs. In reply, Beth Mooney led Australia's charge as it overhauled the total in only 14.2 overs. It was down to 35-3 at one stage, but Mooney scored 43 not out off 38 balls to lead her side to victory. In the second game of the day, Bangladesh faces England. Opting to bat, Sri Lanka suffered crucial early blows. Skipper Chamari Athapaththu was out lbw to Ashleigh Gardner for just three runs. Schutt and Molineux then combined to hit the top-order hard, as Sri Lanka was down to 25-3 in 6.4 overs. Nilakshi de Silva scored 29 not out off 40 balls, while Harshitha Madavi scored 23 runs. Their 31-run partnership for the fourth wicket saved the Asian champions some embarrassment. Molineux broke that partnership in the 13th over, and then Sri Lanka went down to 89-7 within another 6.2 overs. Its innings struggled on either side of that partnership, thus finishing with a below-par total. In reply, Australia's top-order struggled as well. Skipper Alyssa Healy was dismissed for four, while Georgia Wareham was run out for three runs. When Sugandika Kumari bowled Ellyse Perry for 17 in the sixth over, there was some trouble. But Mooney dug in deep, and found support from Gardner, who put in 12 runs. Together they added 43 off only 40 balls as Australia sped up its chase in the second half.

Bishnoi got support Sunday from left-arm spinner Axar Patel (2-30), while pacers Hardik Pandya and Arshdeep Singh shared four wickets, as Sri Lanka was restricted to 161-9 in 20 overs. Rain impacted the game twice – first, when the start was delayed by 45 minutes without any overs lost. Later, it stopped the game for another 70 minutes with India at 6-0 halfway through the first over of its chase. On resumption, the match was shortened to eight overs with a target of 78 runs under the DLS method. That left India needing 72 runs off 45 balls. Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal scored 30 off 15 balls, while skipper Suryakumar Yadav hit a 12-ball 26. Hardik Pandya smacked 22 not out off nine balls, as India powered to 81-3 in 6.3 overs. India won the first T20 by 43 runs. The third and final T20 will be played on Tuesday, also in Pallekele. The two teams will also play three one-day internationals. Earlier, Pathum Nissanka provided another good start for Sri Lanka after India won the delayed toss and opted to bowl. Opener Shubman Gill was left out owing to a neck spasm. Sanju Samson was his replacement. Nissanka scored 32 off 24 with five fours. After opener Kusal Mendis was out for 10, Nissanka put on 54 runs off 36 balls for the second wicket with Kusal Perera. The latter stroked his way to 53 off 34, hitting two sixes and six fours. Bishnoi got the breakthrough by trapping Nissanka lbw in the 10th over. Perera added another 50 runs with Kamindu Mendis (26), but Bishnoi returned to trigger another middle-order collapse. Prior to that, Pandya broke through with the twin dismissals of Perera and Mendis – both caught in the deep by Rinku Singh. Bishnoi then bowled Dasun Shanaka for a golden duck, immediately following it up with another first-ball dismissal of Wanindu Hasaranga. The player of the match was on a hat trick in the 17th over, but was denied. ""The pitch was turning today. It helped the spinners in the first innings,"" Bishnoi said. ""I love bowling the wrong 'uns and stick to my plans. I enjoy bowling towards the death overs."" Sri Lanka was 130-2 after 15 overs but managed only 31 runs for seven wickets in the final five overs. After the lengthy rain break, India was dealt an early blow in its reduced chase when Maheesh Theekshana bowled Samson for a golden duck in the second over. Jaiswal countered with two sixes and three fours, while Yadav struck four fours and a six. The duo raced to 39 off 19 balls for the second wicket. India lost both Jaiswal and Yadav in successive overs, but Pandya delivered the win to secure the series.","overs, runs, the, balls, t20, fours, jaiswal, bishnoi, pallekele, rain, ravi, suryakumar, axar, hardik, pandya, reduced, yashasvi, opener, kusal, another"

The England captain needed only 24 deliveries Sunday to reach his half-century. He finished on 57 off 28 balls and got the winning runs with a six off Kraigg Brathwaite. Ben Duckett contributed a 16-ball 25. The opening pair scored at a run rate of almost 12 to hit 87-0 in 7.2 overs in England's second innings. Regular opener Zak Crawley fractured his little finger in the field, giving Stokes the opportunity to promote himself to opener and entertain the Edgbaston crowd. West Indies resumed Sunday on 33-2 but collapsed against Wood. He took his wickets in a ferocious spell after lunch, dismissing Josh Da Silva, Alzarri Joseph, Kavem Hodge, Jayden Seales and Shamar Joseph in the space of 21 dramatic deliveries. Wood intimidated the tourists with bumpers, threatened their outside edges with reverse swing and blitzed the stumps when he went full and fast. ""It was an amazing spell. He's got the heart of a lion and that's exactly what you want as a captain,"" Stokes said. By the time Wood was done the tourists had slumped from 156-5 to 175 all out, leaving England chasing just 82 to win. Gus Atkinson claimed 2-28 and Stokes also contributed with the ball by claiming West Indies top-scorer Mikyle Louis for 57. Hodge was caught behind against Wood for 55. Stokes shaved four deliveries off Ian Botham's 43-year-old record of 28 balls for England's fastest ever test half-century. ""I'm pretty chuffed to go past Beefy,"" Stokes said. ""A bottle of champagne would be appreciated."" It was test cricket's third fastest 50 overall. Only Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq, who reached the same landmark in just 21 deliveries against Australia in Abu Dhabi in 2014, and David Warner, who did it in 23 for Australia against Pakistan in Sydney three years later, are ahead of Stokes in the all-time list. Seamer Gus Atkinson was England's player of the series after taking 22 wickets overall. Jayden Seales, who took 13 wickets overall, was West Indies' player of the series. England won the first test at Lord's by an innings and 114 runs, and the second test at Trent Bridge by 241 runs.","deliveries, indies, test, misbah, botham, mikyle, the, england, haq, wickets, louis, west, ian, joseph, zak, atkinson, gus, crawley, spell, century"

Root (122) and Brook (109), the long-reigning king of England's batting unit and his heir apparent, reeled off classy centuries to pave the way for a sprint to victory on the fourth evening of the test. Root hit his 32nd test ton to move only one century behind England great Alastair Cook. England took an insurmountable 2-0 lead in the three-test series. Chasing an unlikely target of 385 after England's second-innings 425 all out, the tourists were demolished for 143 in just 36.1 overs as Bashir did the damage. The 20-year-old, who did not get a single over in the first test at Lord's, justified the selection gamble that saw him fast-tracked ahead of the established Jack Leach this summer as he took the role of fourth-innings finisher. Bashir removed Kirk McKenzie, Kavem Hodge and Alick Athanaze in the space of three overs to derail the tourists before cleaning up Jason Holder and last man Shamar Joseph. ""I think what Bash has done today is to show the world what he can do,"" England captain Ben Stokes said. ""That wicket hardly offered anything for a spinner throughout the whole test match and look at what he was able to do today."" It was a perfect finale for England's first home test without Stuart Broad or James Anderson since 2012. England's attack was in clinical mood as it forced a dramatic West Indies collapse from 61 without loss to 91-6. Chris Woakes got things moving by dismissing both openers, Mark Wood added a dash of raw pace and Gus Atkinson picked up two. But it was fitting for Bashir, the youngest member of a revamped XI, to apply the killer blow as he clean bowled Joseph. Captain Kraigg Brathwaite top-scored for West Indies with 47 before he was caught behind off Woakes (2-28). Holder scored 37. Earlier, England already had a healthy lead of 207 and seven wickets in hand at the start of the fourth day. Yorkshire duo Root and Brook stretched their partnership to 189 as both men progressed to impressive hundreds. A sprinted single on 99 showed Brook's hunger to experience a first test hundred on home soil. Brook's four previous tons had come at Rawalpindi, Multan, Karachi and Wellington, but his fifth will go down as a special one in front of his own fans. Root was more measured, scoring with a gentle ease that made the job look remarkably straightforward. The shot that took him to three figures was just his seventh boundary, though he quickly followed with a trademark reverse scoop to remind onlookers of the higher gears at his disposal. By the end of his stay Root had moved up to eighth on the all-time test run-scorers list, just 13 away from West Indies great Brian Lara. Brook flat-footed on the cut and Root chipped to cover, but they had already done more than enough. The hosts finished on 425, taking a slice of history as the only England side to pass 400 in both innings of a test. It was an unlucky 13 overs for England with the new ball as the West Indies openers rode their luck to make a bright start to their chase. But when it changed, it changed fast. England took wickets in each of their next four overs, turning solid foundations into sand. England won the first test at Lord's by an innings and 114 runs. Edgbaston will host the third and final test, starting Friday.","test, the, england, indies, brook, lara, alastair, overs, cook, leach, shamar, brathwaite, kraigg, fourth, west, brian, bashir, shoaib, joseph, tons"

England won last week's series opener at Lord's by an innings without any batsman scoring more than 76, but Pope rode his luck as his knock of 121 carried the hosts to 416 all out. He saw two regulation chances dropped either side of lunch, by Alick Athanaze with Pope on 46 and Jason Holder on 54. That was all the encouragement he needed to deliver the sixth hundred of his career, anchoring an innings that also included a blistering 71 from Ben Duckett and 69 from skipper Ben Stokes. The West Indies badly needed a strong outing after a demoralizing first test but their handling errors proved costly. As well as Pope's twin reprieve, there were two more drops and a missed stumping as they failed to back their bowlers. Visiting captain Kraigg Brathwaite sprung a surprise at the toss when he sent England in to bat, a gamble that quickly came good when Alzarri Joseph snagged Zak Crawley's outside edge with the third ball of the match. England, though, were unfazed and Duckett set a rollicking pace in the morning session. The left-hander propelled his side to 50 quicker than any other in test history, in just 26 balls, and reached his own half-century in 32. Only Ian Botham and Jonny Bairstow have ever done it faster for England. His hopes of converting his rapid half-century into three figures before lunch were ended by Shamar Joseph, who had him well caught at second slip. Had Athanaze held on to Pope in the last over before lunch, it might have changed things, but the chance tumbled to the turf and allowed England to rest easy on 134-2. Joe Root had a messy exit, hacking Jayden Seales to mid-on, and Harry Brook scooped Kevin Sinclair to short-leg for 36 to tee up an acrobatic somersault celebration from the spinner. Pope, however, matured as the innings went on and picked off a steady supply of loose offerings. He reached his ton in style, sweeping Sinclair for four then stepping back to pull Seales through midwicket. Pope looked in control by the time Alzarri Joseph finally took an edge that stuck but England had plenty in the tank. Stokes pulled powerfully as he ended a run of low scores with a punchy half-century, while Jamie Smith smashed two sixes in a cameo of 36. Both were caught trying to hammer poor deliveries from the slow bowlers, while Gus Atkinson was nicely caught at slip. Mark Wood survived two near misses but Holder clung on to Chris Woakes (37) and Shoaib Bashir to wrap up the innings by stumps.","century, pope, indies, botham, test, ben, brathwaite, kraigg, his, west, ian, zak, joseph, the, stokes, crawley, ollie, sinclair, bowlers, half"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/704-wickets-and-out-england-great-jimmy-anderson-bows-out-of-test-cricket-in-win-over-west-indies,704 wickets and out: England great Jimmy Anderson bows out of test cricket in win over West Indies,Associated Press,2024-07-13 00:31:38,"LONDON, JULY 12 It's 704 wickets and out for Jimmy Anderson. The most prolific fast bowler in test history bowed out of international cricket by helping England complete a win by an innings and 114 runs over the West Indies at Lord's on Friday. The 41-year-old Anderson's 188th and last test ended with him taking 3-32 in the West Indies' second innings as they were dismissed for 136 a little over an hour into the third day's play. One of those wickets came on Friday, with Anderson enticing an edge behind off Joshua Da Silva with a delivery that seamed away. It was classic Anderson - unlike the caught-and-bowled chance he dropped off Gudakesh Motie with England needing just one more wicket for victory. He fell to his knees and covered his face with his hand. Soon, he was walking off the field at the home of cricket - in front of his parents, wife and children - to another standing ovation after Gus Atkinson took the final wicket. The morning started with Anderson, who doesn't like being the center of attention, looking emotional after being given a guard of honor from both teams - and a first standing ovation from the crowd - when he came out at the start of the day's play. Speaking after the match while holding a pint of Guinness in the England dressing room, Anderson said: ""I feel about 55 after the overs I bowled this week. ""Playing for England,"" he added in an interview with Sky Sports, ""is the best job in the world. I've been privileged to have done it for a long time."" Atkinson, who represents the future of English pace bowling, took three of the wickets after the Windies resumed on 79-6 - still 171 runs adrift of making England batting again - and had match figures of 12-106 on test debut. He became the first England bowler to get a 10-wicket haul in a test at home since Alec Bedser in 1946. Anderson finished his test career four wickets behind the late Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne's tally of 708 wickets. Only one bowler has more than them: Former Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralitharan with 800. Anderson ended his test career where it started 21 years ago, when he ran in to bowl against Zimbabwe at Lord's with tinges of blond in his hair. ""I've been lucky to play with some amazing players, some of the most talented cricketers that have ever played the game,"" he said. ""And more importantly some really good blokes and friends I have made for life. ""Part of me is jealous that these lads get to experience that for the next few years,"" he said, looking around the dressing room as his teammates listened to his every word. ""The advice I would pass onto them is just enjoy every moment, because it's a great ride."" Anderson will remain in the England camp for the rest of the West Indies series, which continues with the second test starting on July 18. He will act as a mentor for the team's fast bowlers and said he doesn't know if he will return to domestic cricket with county side Lancashire. India great Sachin Tendulkar was among those paying tribute to Anderson. ""It has been a joy to watch you bowl - with that action, speed, accuracy, swing and fitness,"" Tendulkar wrote on X. ""You've inspired generations with your game. ""Wish you a wonderful life ahead with good health and happiness as you put those new shoes on for the most important spell of your life - the time with family.""","the, indies, test, anderson, west, wickets, shane, warne, sachin, tendulkar, dressing, his, jimmy, bowler, england, wicket, cricket, room, july, bedser"

The home of cricket was primed Wednesday to pay tribute to Anderson - lining up for his country for the final time after a record-breaking 22-year career - but instead witnessed Surrey pacer Atkinson assume center stage as he helped to topple the tourists for 121 all out in the first test. Anderson dismissed No. 11 Jayden Seales to end the innings and give a sellout crowd the moment they came for. England had assumed complete control by the close at 189-3 in its first innings with half-centuries from Zak Crawley (76) and Ollie Pope (57). But the heavy lifting was done by Atkinson, who returned career-best first-class figures as he became the fifth bowler to claim a five-for on debut under Ben Stokes' captaincy. He struck with only his second delivery as a test cricketer, added another before he had even conceded a run and then took three wickets in four balls during the afternoon session. Atkinson was on course for the best figures by an England bowler on test debut, denied only by a late boundary that left Dominic Cork's haul of 7-43 in 1995 intact. While Anderson was upstaged at his own farewell event, he may have enjoyed a moment of nostalgia recalling his own debut five-for at the same ground back in 2003. The country's record wicket-taker was everywhere at the start of play - staring out from the front of the matchday program, featuring in a series of loving television montages and splashed in silhouette across a commemorative hoodie on sale in the club shop. His daughters Ruby and Lola even had the honor of ringing the five-minute bell at the start of the day. Stokes gave fans what they wanted when he won the toss and opted to bowl first under cloudy skies, but all that was missing was an early breakthrough for the man of the moment. Anderson bowled tidily and beat the bat a couple of times in a five-over burst with the new ball but it was not until Atkinson took over that things began to happen. His second ball was little more than a loosener but Windies captain Kraigg Brathwaite waved a crooked bat outside off stump and dragged down his own stumps. Atkinson then picked up a more classical wicket, suckering Kirk McKenzie into a drive and seeing a thick edge sail through to slip. West Indies struggled to 61-3 at lunch, Stokes accounting for debutant opener Mikyle Louis for 27 thanks to a brilliant one-handed slip catch from Harry Brook. Atkinson returned to cause havoc after the interval, finding himself on a hat trick in his ninth over as he had Alick Athanaze and Jason Holder caught in the cordon. Joshua Da Silva kept out a decent hat-trick delivery but succumbed to the next one, to give England's new wicketkeeper Jamie Smith his first catch and Atkinson a place on the honors board. A brilliant reaction catch from Pope claimed Kavem Hodge - taking the score from 88-3 to 88-7 in the space of eight balls. Atkinson snapped up two more, Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph both trying and failing to slog their way out of trouble, before Anderson finished things off by trapping Seales lbw. Seales returned fire when he had Ben Duckett caught behind for three but England stamped its authority with a stand of 94 between Crawley and Pope. Both men survived big lbw appeals from Holder on their way to 50, sharing 19 boundaries as they went. Holder finally got a decision to go his way when he pinned Pope in front of leg stump and Seales yorked Crawley as he began to eye a century, leaving Joe Root (15 not out) and Brook (25 not out) in place at the close.","the, anderson, test, atkinson, cork, his, mikyle, ben, jayden, seales, catch, louis, dominic, five, joseph, farewell, debutant, gus, stokes, hat"

Right on cue, Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick in the fifth of six added minutes sent Sunday's game into extra time, and Harry Kane sealed a 2-1 win that keeps alive England's hopes of a first major trophy since 1966. England was seconds away from slumping to one of the biggest upsets in the history of the European Championship when trailing 1-0 to Slovakia deep into stoppage time in the round of 16. ""I think it was 30 or 20 seconds until we were out of the European Championship,"" Bellingham said. ""It's hard to deny that it was one of the most important moments of my career so far."" He's had a few. The midfielder, who turned 21 on Saturday, has just completed a stunning debut season at Real Madrid, winning the Champions League and the Spanish title. At such a young age, he is already one of England's most important players and delivered a moment of magic when all hope seemed lost. ""His world is different to pretty much every other 21-year-old in the world... what he can provide are these moments where he grabs things by the scruff of the neck and his character and his personality creates moments that can change a big game,"" said England manager Gareth Southgate, who admitted he thought a tired-looking Bellingham was ""out on his feet"" 15 minutes before the end of regulation time. England - one of the pre-tournament favorites and runner-up at the last Euros - trailed to 45th-ranked Slovakia after Ivan Schranz's 25th-minute goal. With the clock running down, Bellingham's time came. Kyle Walker launched a long throw from the right. Marc Guehi leapt to flick the ball on. Bellingham was in the box and had to readjust his body to execute a perfect overhead kick, sending the ball into the bottom corner to leave Slovakia goalkeeper Martin Dubravka stuck on his line as he watched it nestle into the back of the net. Some England fans had already left the stadium. Those inside erupted. ""I had a funny feeling the game wasn't dead and I know that sounds ridiculous. We were pushing and probing,"" Southgate said. Bellingham's goal was England's first shot on target in the match. It didn't have to wait long for its second as Kane headed home to score his seventh goal in his last seven knockout games at major tournaments. It was also a record-extending 65th for his country. England will play Switzerland in the quarterfinals in Duesseldorf on Saturday. But for so long it looked like being a humbling exit for Southgate's team - bringing back memories of its elimination at the hands of Iceland at Euro 2016. ""It's knockout football and anything is possible,"" Southgate said. England had faced fierce criticism for its performances in the group stage and boos rang around the stadium in the first half as frustration grew among its fans following Schranz's strike. It needed to improve in the second half. Phil Foden had a goal ruled out by VAR, Kane headed wide from close range and Declan Rice hit the post in the 81st. Slovakia had already produced a shock by beating No.3-ranked Belgium in the group stage and it looked like doing it again against the No. 5-ranked team in the world. That was until Bellingham struck. ""They scored a goal from a player who is valued at 100 million euros. This was a team worth 1.5 billion (euros). You concede just half a meter and you will get punished,"" Slovakia coach Francesco Calzona said.","bellingham, the, schranz, southgate, england, slovakia, euros, francesco, calzona, his, gareth, dubravka, goal, moments, ivan, martin, knockout, ranked, kick, gelsenkirchen"

Belgium shook off the shock of losing to Slovakia in its opening game of the European Championship by beating Romania 2-0 on Saturday. Kevin De Bruyne's second-half goal completed the win after Youri Tielemans scored in the second minute at Cologne Stadium. Watching on were Belgium's King Philippe and Queen Mathilde. ""We knew what we needed to do. We needed to win otherwise we were going home,"" De Bruyne said. ""I will do everything I can to keep the lads on track."" This was just what Belgium needed after the Slovakia stunner, which raised the prospect of another early exit from a major tournament after being eliminated at the group stage of the 2022 World Cup. Tielemans gave the No. 3-ranked team in the world a flying start with a goal from the edge of the area. De Bruyne converted direct from Belgium goalkeeper Koen Casteels' long kick in the 80th. The result means all four teams in Group E have three points and there is all to play for in the final round of games on Wednesday, when Belgium plays Ukraine and Romania takes on Slovakia. ""I'm very relieved we won the game. It was very important to get the three points,"" Belgium coach Domenico Tedesco said. While Belgium won, there was more frustration for Romelu Lukaku, who had a third goal ruled out by VAR at these Euros. Still, he was at the center of his team's great start when laying the ball off for Tielemans to drive in low from the edge of the box. Belgium has been criticized for failing to live up to expectations in the past, and its opening defeat would not have helped the confidence among the squad going into Saturday's game. Tielemans' goal seemed to lift the pressure, and Belgium ruled the rest of the half with 67% of possession. Lukaku thought he scored after the break, but VAR said he strayed offside before firing past Romania keeper Florin Nita. The longer the game went on without Belgium scoring a second, the more the tension rose. Dennis Man could have evened the score when running through on goal, but was denied by Casteels. The keeper then turned provider with a long punt upfield, which De Bruyne raced on to and fired home. Tedesco thought his team took too long to seal the win. ""Scoring four or five goals tonight was possible,"" he said. ""It is important to create chances, but you have to kill the game earlier for sure."" Under former Belgium coach Roberto Martinez, Portugal advanced to the knockout phase after a 3-0 win against Turkey in Group F. Georgia picked up its first ever point at a major tournament after a drawing the Czech Republic 1-1 and still has hopes of advancing.","belgium, the, cologne, bruyne, florin, domenico, nita, tedesco, casteels, koen, tielemans, goal, keeper, martinez, group, roberto, kevin, mathilde, stunner, kev"

Defender Nico Schlotterbeck leaped up, next to the even more imposing center-back Antonio Rüdiger, who reached highest of all. In front of them both was substitute Niclas Füllkrug. The German trio was circled by three Swiss opponents trying to protect a 1-0 lead two minutes into stoppage time. Six pairs of feet off the ground in unison, straining to be the one to head the ball. It was Füllkrug who won the contest, guiding the ball crossed from another substitute David Raum back across Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer into the top corner of the net. The match ended 1-1. ""We risked a lot in this phase because we could have conceded a second goal,"" Germany coach Julian Nagelesmann said about throwing his defenders into attack. ""Who doesn't dare to risk, doesn't get to draw."" Germany had already advanced to the round of 16 before kickoff Sunday, but a draw felt like a win in the circumstances and kept the momentum of impressive wins against Scotland and Hungary. ""When you see how the Germans celebrated their goal that says everything,"" said Switzerland captain Granit Xhaka, named player of the match. Switzerland impressed while protecting a 28th-minute goal from Dan Ndoye's clever volleyed shot, and chasing a bigger lead. A second goal was denied by a marginal offside ruling against Ruben Vargas and a fine save by Manuel Neuer from Xhaka's shot. The point for each team ensured Germany finished top and Switzerland second in Group A. Hungary took third place in the standings with an even later stoppage-time goal to beat Scotland 1-0 in Stuttgart. Germany now goes to Dortmund for a round of 16 game Saturday against the runner-up in Group C. That opponent can be any of the four teams - England, Slovenia, Denmark or Serbia - playing their final round of Group C games on Tuesday. Nagelsmann acknowledged Germany's opponent might not like having two fewer days of rest, though added: ""We have to prepare for four teams, they only have to prepare for one team."" Switzerland heads to the Olympic Stadium in Berlin to open the round of 16 on Saturday against the runner-up in Group B, likely Italy or Croatia. They meet Monday in their decisive group game. Coach Murat Yakin suggested Switzerland had earned the right to make a higher-ranked opponent concerned about his unbeaten team. ""I think we have a certain standing which we worked hard for. We're on a good path,"" Yakin said, ""without a defeat, with a very good style of play. We like being the dark horse."" Switzerland's goal was made in Bologna, the upstart Italian club that has qualified for its first Champions League entry next season. Ndoye timed his run to meet a floated pass across the goalmouth from his Bologna teammate Remo Freuler. The attack began when Fabian Rieder, making his first start since the 2022 World Cup, won the ball in the German half and then fed Freuler. A video review had denied Germany taking the lead in the 17th. Robert Andrich's long-range shot bounced up and over the dive of Sommer, but the VAR team alerted Italian referee Daniele Orsato to an earlier foul in the goalmouth by Jamal Musiala. The much-criticized Waldstadion playing surface behaved better Sunday and the roof stayed closed to protect it though no more rain is forecast for at least five days. The turf cut up during both previous Euro 2024 games in Frankfurt. It has seemed not to bed in properly since being laid in November after the stadium hosted two NFL games. Frankfurt will host two more games, finishing with a round of 16 match that will include Group F winner Portugal perhaps facing Hungary, which faces a three-day wait to learn its fate.","group, goal, the, switzerland, xhaka, euro, sommer, andrich, murat, nagelesmann, daniele, orsato, granit, yakin, ndoye, schlotterbeck, opponent, rüdiger, yann, füllkrug"

The 34-year-old German midfielder said Tuesday it was a tough decision, but that the timing felt ""somehow perfect."" ""I always wanted to leave at the peak of my abilities and I know, and from a lot of examples you see, that it isn't easy, that you can miss that point in time very quickly,"" Kroos said on a podcast he hosts with his brother. ""I never wanted to have the feeling at the end that the club, the fans, the people around me would have to tell me, 'That's enough,' or that I'd spend another two or three years sitting on the bench."" Madrid thanked Kroos and hailed his achievements with the team. ""Real Madrid would like to express its gratitude and affection to Toni Kroos, a player who will go down in Real Madrid history as one of our club and international football's greatest legends,"" the club said. Kroos was a World Cup champion with Germany in 2014 in Brazil, and had a successful career with Bayern Munich as well, helping it win one Champions League and three German league titles. Madrid will face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final on June 1 in London. His European trophies with Madrid came in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2022. He won the Champions League with Bayern in 2013. Kroos has been with Madrid since 2014, helping it win 22 titles, including four European Cups and four Spanish leagues. He made 463 appearances with the club, which called the midfielder ""a key player in one of the most successful periods of Real Madrid's 122-year history."" ""Toni Kroos is one of the great players in Real Madrid history and this club will always be his home,"" club president Florentino Pérez said. Madrid said Kroos will remain forever in the hearts of every fan ""thanks to his mastery of the game and the fact he has given his all for our jersey, a steadfast example of the values of Real Madrid."" Kroos' contract with Madrid was expiring at the end of this season and the club and the player had reportedly been negotiating an extension. Kroos said in February he agreed to play for Germany at Euro 2024 after a request from coach Julian Nagelsmann. He has not played for for the national team in almost three years, since Germany's loss to England in the second round of the last European Championship. Kroos was named last week in Germany's preliminary squad for the tournament. He had said a few months ago that he didn't know what would happen next season. ""I thought it over for a really long time and in the last few days I've reached the conclusion that this season, this wonderful season, the 10th season with Real, is also my last season with Real,"" Kroos said Tuesday. ""And anyone who has paid attention when listening to me over the last few months or years will have heard the sentence at one time or other that the only option for me was to end my career at Real Madrid. And if you can put one and one together, you know that my last season with Real means it's over this summer. No more Real, no more football.""","kroos, madrid, the, european, season, toni, league, real, florentino, club, champions, nagelsmann, last, julian, pérez, championship, player, cups, titles, german"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/france-and-germany-beat-fierce-rivals-in-nations-league,France and Germany beat fierce rivals in Nations League,Associated Press,2024-10-15 22:16:01,"MUNICH, OCTOBER 15 France and Germany had stand-in forwards to thank for wins over fierce rivals in the Nations League on Monday. With Kylian Mbappé again absent, Randal Kolo Muani started up front for France and scored in each half in a 2-1 victory away to neighbor Belgium. The Belgians must be sick of the sight of Kolo Muani, who also netted in a 2-0 win in the reverse fixture in Lyon last month. It was also the Paris Saint-Germain striker's shot that deflected into the net when France beat Belgium 1-0 in the last 16 at the European Championship during the summer. On his debut for Germany, Jamie Leweling had a second-minute strike ruled out after a video review but had more luck with a rasping drive in the 64th to seal a 1-0 triumph over the Netherlands in Munich. Leweling, a forward for Stuttgart, was one of four players making their first starts for Germany on a night fans paid tribute to four players - Toni Kroos, Manuel Neuer, Thomas Muller and Ilkay Gundogan - who recently retired from national-team duty. Neuer, Muller and Gundogan were at Allianz Arena to receive the acclaim of Germany fans. There were also victories for Italy, which beat Israel 4-1, and Hungary, a 2-0 winner in Bosnia, in the top-tier League A. With two group games remaining in November, France, Italy and Germany all stand on the verge of clinching a top-two finish and spots in the quarterfinals. France holds on France was forced to hang on to preserve its third win in four group matches after Aurélien Tchouaméni, its captain in the absence of Mbappé, was shown a second yellow card in the 76th for tripping Belgium midfielder Youri Tielemans. Tielemans had earlier lifted a penalty kick over the bar in the 23rd, only for Kolo Muani to convert his own spot kick after Wout Faes was penalized for handball after falling to the ground attempting to challenge Bradley Barcola. Loïs Openda headed in the equalizer from Timothy Castagne's cross, with the goal initially ruled out for offside but awarded after VAR check. Kolo Muani, who has started only two games for PSG this season, grabbed the winner in the 62nd in Brussels by heading in Lucas Digne's left-wing cross. New era It felt like a new era for Germany, with Neuer, Muller and Gundogan all given a fond farewell before the game. Together with Kroos, who wasn't there in person due to commitments at his youth academy, the four players won more than 450 caps for Germany. Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann is bringing through younger players, with Aleksandar Pavlovic, 20, and Angelo Stiller, 23, handed first starts and the 23-year-old Leweling making his debut in place of the injured Deniz Undav. At the other end of the age scale, goalkeeper Oliver Baumann became the third oldest debutant for Germany - at 34 years, 134 days - having been on the bench 26 times. Baumann produced a brilliant flying save to deny Netherlands substitute Donyell Malen and keep a clean sheet, ensuring the Oranje's 13-match unbeaten streak in the group stage of the Nations League came to an end. Germany is on 10 points from four games, five more than both the Dutch and Hungary. High alert Stringent security measures, including armed military personnel on the roof of the 25,000-seater stadium in Udine, were in place as Italy hosted an Israel team playing its first match outside neutral Hungary this year. It came amid Israel's ongoing conflict in the Middle East which has spread to Lebanon after more than a year-long war with Hamas in Gaza. Mateo Retegui - from the penalty spot - scored the opener for Italy, which had further goals by Giovanni Di Lorenzo (2) and Davide Frattesi as well as a debut for Daniel Maldini, the son of AC Milan great Paolo Maldini. Around 1,000 people took part in a pro-Palestine demonstration in the city center before the match. Areas around the stadium were blocked off 48 hours before kickoff and declared a ""red zone,"" while hundreds of extra police officers were called up from surrounding areas. Italy is in the same group as France and leads by one point. Belgium is third, five points behind France, while Israel has lost all four games.","the, maldini, kolo, muani, castagne, baumann, leweling, league, deniz, oliver, digne, tielemans, youri, paolo, donyell, toni, starts, kroos, malen, undav"

Denis Undav scored twice and the four-time World Cup winners extended their unbeaten record in the Nations League to three matches after a convincing 2-1 win at Bosnia-Herzegovina on Friday. Reduced to 10 men, the Netherlands managed a 1-1 draw in Hungary. Following the retirements of Manuel Neuer and Toni Kroos, Germany started a new cycle and their clean and fluid display against a spirited Bosnia side bodes well for the future. The Germans top their group after also thrashing Hungary 5-0 and drawing in the Netherlands 2-2. In the absence of several stalwarts, the Germans played with confidence, developed complex attacking moves and gave the impression of enjoying themselves. They had plenty of chances to score more and had a couple of goals disallowed for offside. ""I knew that Bosnia and Herzegovina are good defensively but you have to keep in mind that we had many chances,"" said Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann. ""That's why Bosnia and Herzegovina stayed in the game."" The only downside was the defensive lapse when Hungary's Edin Dzeko pulled one back 20 minutes from time. The visitors took the lead in the 30th minute at the conclusion of a move that showcased Florian Wirtz's cleverness. The unmarked midfielder collected a lofted pass in the box and, instead of trying his luck, cut an unexpected back pass to Undav, who calmly finished the move. Undav, who marked his first start for Germany with a goal against the Netherlands, was clinical on Friday. His Stuttgart clubmate Maximilian Mittelstädt was the provider six minutes later with an excellent cross, and Undav doubled Germany's lead with a clean tap-in from close range. Bosnia's Ermedin Demirovic, another Stuttgart player, hit the woodwork in the 35th, but Dzeko scored in the 70th with a header from a corner, his 67th goal for the national team. Hungary holds the Netherlands The Dutch's unbeaten run was almost stopped at Puskas Arena. The Netherlands won all nine previous meetings with Hungary and enjoyed most of the possession in the first half. But it could not find an edge to get past the staunch Hungarian defense. Roland Sallai put the host in the driver's seat in the 32nd with a close-range finish from Zsolt Nagy's cross. The Dutch looked set for a dreadful evening when defender Virgil van Dijk was sent off for a second yellow card but Denzel Dumfries earned a point for the visitors with a header from Cody Gakpo's curled free kick in the 83rd. ""Even with 10 men, we tried to put pressure forward,"" Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman said. ""I did have the idea: we're going to score. If you have a man less, you are relieved that you still (finish) 1-1."" Germany opened a two-point lead over the Netherlands at the top of the A3 Group. Hungary was third ahead of Bosnia. Ukraine downs Georgia 1-0 Georgia's unbeaten record was ended by Ukraine in Group B1. Georgia, the surprise of this year's European Championship, won its first two games and remained at the top of the group despite the loss. Mykhailo Mudryk scored the winner for Ukraine, earning the war-torn country its first points in the tournament. The Czech Republic won against Albania 2-0. Other results Iceland erased a two-goal deficit to draw with Wales 2-2. Brennan Johnson scored in a seventh consecutive game for club and country as the Tottenham winger put Wales ahead with the opener. Turkey defeated Montenegro 1-0 in the other Group B4 game.

Dortmund had been demolished 5-1 by Stuttgart last week and the pressure on new coach Nuri Sahin seemed to be mounting when his team conceded two early goals against Bochum. In the space of five minutes, Matus Bero scored off a smartly executed one-two through the center, then Dani de Wit made it 2-0 after teammate Myron Boadu had snatched the ball off Dortmund's goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. On the sideline, Sahin spread his arms wide in a gesture of indignation. Dortmund clawed its way back into the game, first with a Guirassy header just before halftime to cut the deficit to 2-1, then a penalty from Emre Can leveled the score after a clumsy foul on Guirassy. It was Dortmund's turn to slice through Bochum on the counter after that, Karim Adeyemi playing a perfect through-ball for Guirassy to make it 3-2 with a shot between goalkeeper Patrick Drewes' legs. A fumble by Drewes let Felix Nmecha's shot roll over the line for Dortmund's fourth. Dortmund rises to second in the table ahead of the weekend's games, behind only Bayern Munich, and has 10 points from five games. Last season's Champions League runner-up continues its campaign in the revamped competition at home to Scottish club Celtic on Tuesday. Bochum is second-to-last in the 18-team Bundesliga with a solitary point under new coach Peter Zeidler.","dortmund, zeidler, nmecha, drewes, sahin, felix, nuri, guirassy, patrick, peter, bundesliga, champions, the, deficit, rival, gregor, boadu, myron, fumble, kobel"

The teenager's double, plus second-half goals from Dani Olmo and Pedri, gave Barcelona a commanding 4-1 win at Catalan rival Girona on Sunday, keeping a four-point lead at the top. Atletico Madrid kept pace by beating last-place Valencia 3-0 with goals from Antoine Griezmann and newly signed players Julián Álvarez and Conor Gallagher, while Real Madrid had won 2-0 at Real Sociedad on Saturday with goals from Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior. Along with Atletico and Madrid, Villarreal was the other team four points behind Barcelona after winning 2-1 at Mallorca on Saturday. ""To help the team it's important to score the goals and to do whatever is needed,"" Yamal said. ""The first match after the international break is always complicated. Now we can start focusing on the match against Monaco (in the Champions League on Thursday)."" Yamal's goals on Sunday were his second and third of the season. The 17-year-old Spain international opened the scoring after stealing the ball from a defender and sending a close-range shot into the net in the 30th minute. He scored again in the 37th after picking up a loose ball inside the area. Olmo's third goal since joining Barcelona this season came from a tight angle in the 47th, and Pedri sealed the easy victory with a goal from inside the area in the 64th. Olmo, who had to be replaced in the second half because of a right leg injury, became the first player to score in his first three league games for Barcelona since Cesc Fabregas in 2011. Only Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in 2009, achieved the same feat this century. Cristhian Stuani scored Girona's lone goal in the 80th. The hosts were initially awarded a penalty kick for a handball inside the area just before halftime, with Barcelona leading 2-0, but the call was reversed by video review. Barcelona played with 10 men from the 87th after Ferran Torres was sent off for a hard foul on an opponent. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski played his 100th match with Barcelona. Girona, a surprise third-place finisher last season, won both league games against Barcelona last season. Atletico Madrid tops Valencia Newly signed Argentina forward Álvarez and England midfielder Gallagher scored their first goals for Atletico Madrid in the team's 3-0 win over last-place Valencia. Álvarez sealed the home victory in stoppage time after Gallagher had opened the scoring in the 39th and Griezmann had doubled the lead in the 54th. ""I didn't feel like I was under pressure to score,"" Álvarez said. ""I was ready for when the opportunity appeared."" It was the second consecutive win for Atletico, and third in five league matches. Diego Simeone's team drew its other two games. Valencia has opened its season with four losses and a draw - 1-1 against Villarreal in the previous round. Earlier Sunday, 10-man Athletic Bilbao won 3-2 at Las Palmas, which hasn't won in 19 straight league games going back to last season. It was the second win for Athletic this season. Celta Vigo beat Valladolid 3-1 at home for its first win after two consecutive losses. It was the fourth straight game without a win for Valladolid after it opened with a victory at Espanyol. It lost three of its next four games.","the, league, season, win, yamal, goals, games, ibrahimovic, zlatan, olmo, bilbao, athletic, girona, madrid, victory, straight, simeone, second, diego, lewandowski"

Ake injured in Netherlands game,Associated Press,2024-09-11 23:10:05,"LONDON, SEPTEMBER 11 Harry Kane marked his 100th game for England with two goals and celebrations with his family in a 2-0 win over Finland in the UEFA Nations League on Tuesday. Presented with a golden cap before kickoff and playing in gold boots at Wembley Stadium, the England captain was swarmed by his teammates after scoring his first goal in true Kane style. He beat a Finnish defender before unleashing a powerful shot which was still rising as it clipped the underside of the crossbar. The Bayern Munich star's second goal came with an assist from one of England's new faces as Noni Madueke played the pass for Kane to hit a shot that took a slight deflection - not that it mattered to the crowd which gave Kane a standing ovation when he was substituted off soon after. ""It was a big night for me, obviously really proud to reach 100 caps. I want to score goals, I want to help the team,"" Kane told broadcaster ITV. It was the second straight 2-0 win for interim England manager Lee Carsley, who took over on a temporary basis after Gareth Southgate stepped down following England's loss to Spain in the Euro 2024 final. Carsley could yet remain in the position for a while longer if the search for Southgate's permanent successor extends beyond the next international break in October. England is playing in the second tier of the Nations League and is level on six points at the top of its group with Greece, which beat Ireland 2-0. Ake injured in Netherlands draw Manchester City defender Nathan Ake went off with an apparent muscle injury shortly before halftime while playing for the Netherlands in a 2-2 draw with Germany. That could be a blow for City ahead of games against Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday and Inter Milan and Arsenal next week. Denzel Dumfries' goal helped salvage a draw for the Netherlands, which had started well when Tijjani Reijnders' goal gave the Dutch the lead after just one-and-a-half minutes in Amsterdam after being left in plenty of space by the German defense. However, Germany had a 2-1 lead at halftime thanks to goals from Deniz Undav and Joshua Kimmich, before Dumfries leveled in the 50th. Germany and the Netherlands were familiar foes who have played seven times since 2018, and most recently in March. For the Netherlands, it was the first game since coach Ronald Koeman ruled forward Steven Bergwijn out of his plans following the forward's move to the Saudi Arabian league. Koeman suggested Bergwijn, who was on the team at Euro 2024, lacked ambition because of the move. Germany was without Niclas Füllkrug after the West Ham striker struggled with an Achilles tendon problem and was replaced in the lineup by Stuttgart's Undav. In the same group, Hungary and Bosnia-Herzegovina drew 0-0 in the other top-tier game. Also Tuesday, Pavel Sulc scored twice to lift the Czech Republic to a 3-2 win over Ukraine, and Georgia beat Albania 1-0.","the, carsley, ake, league, tijjani, dumfries, southgate, koeman, reijnders, denzel, undav, england, goal, ronald, lee, game, tier, nathan, kane, netherlands"

England was 200-5 at the end of the second session, with Root on 81 and in the middle with allrounder Chris Woakes (6 not out) with only the tail to come. Harry Brook (33) and Jamie Smith (21) were the batters to depart after lunch as Sri Lanka continued to prosper after putting England in on a glorious day at the home of cricket in northwest London. Brook was trapped lbw by seamer Asitha Fernando and Smith feathered behind off Milan Rathnayake. Root, who anchored England to victory in the first test in Manchester last week, was set after going past fifty for the 97th time in tests. Only Sachin Tendulkar (119), Jacques Kallis (103), Ricky Ponting (103) and Rahul Dravid (99) have done so more times. England was its own worst enemy before lunch. While probing bowling by recalled pacer Lahiru Kumara accounted for Dan Lawrence nicking behind for 9, stand-in captain Ollie Pope and Ben Duckett will feel an element of regret after choosing the wrong shot and getting themselves out. Pope (1) got cramped up after opting to pull Fernando and misjudged his shot that looped up into the hands of Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva running to square leg. That made it 42-2, and it was 82-3 when Duckett (40) top-edged a reverse sweep off the fourth ball of spinner Prabath Jayasuriya's first over and was caught near the boundary by Kumara. Sri Lanka's bowling attack was offering more penetration than in the five-wicket loss at Old Trafford.","lanka, sri, asitha, kumara, lahiru, prabath, jayasuriya, 33rd, dhananjaya, fernando, london, woakes, the, ollie, test, silva, pope, chris, lord, dravid"

Opening batter Ibrahim Zadran smashed the tournament's highest-ever individual score of 177 off 146 balls with 12 fours and six sixes and led Afghanistan to 325-7. England was bowled out for 317 with Joe Root's 120 off 111 balls going in vain. Root had kept England in the hunt, but once he gloved fast bowler Azmat Omarzai (5-58) behind the wickets in the 46th over, Afghanistan kept its nerve despite a few fumbles in the field to record a memorable win with one ball to spare. It was Afghanistan's second win against England in a major 50-over ICC tournament; it recorded a 69-run victory in the 2023 World Cup in India. ""As a team we are happy and I'm sure the whole nation will be happy with this win,"" Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi said. ""The beauty of our team is we have talented youngsters and at the same time we have senior guys who are at the top level. Hopefully we take this momentum with us for the next game against Australia."" Afghanistan must beat two-time champion Australia in its last Group B match at the same venue Friday to seal its second straight semifinal in an ICC tournament after playing last year's T20 World Cup playoffs. England, which lost a high-scoring game to Australia at the same venue, will wrap up its disappointing run in the tournament with the match against semifinal contender South Africa at Karachi on Saturday. Root's century in vain Root held the chase together after England lost Phil Salt (12) and newly promoted No. 3 Jamie Smith (9) in a wobbly start to a tall chase. Omarzai knocked back the top of Salt's stumps in his second over and England's experiment with Smith at No. 3 didn't work for second straight game when he skied Mohammad Nabi's (2-57) first ball to Omarzai at backward point. Ben Duckett, who hit 165 against Australia last Saturday, couldn't capitalize on a dropped catch at 30 before Rashid Khan (1-66) had won a leg before wicket through television review, but captain Jos Buttler (38) put the chase back on track with 83-run partnership with Root. Omarzai broke the threatening stand in his return spell when Buttler top-edged the fast bowler just after Root had raised his century off 98 balls with 10 fours. Afghanistan was sloppy in the field for a while but Omarzai's dismissals of Root and Jamie Overton (32) sealed the win. Omarzai completed his five-wicket haul when Zadran caught No. 10 Adil Rashid. ""Another fantastic game of cricket, but disappointing to come out on the wrong side,"" Buttler said. ""He (Root) played an unbelievable innings tonight (but) he needed one of the other top six batters to stay in with him and take the game deeper."" Zadran leads the way The 23-year-old Zadran absorbed the pressure of losing three wickets inside the batting powerplay and anchored Afghanistan to a strong total with his sixth ODI hundred. Jofra Archer's (3-64) triple strike in his first five overs had reduced Afghanistan to 39-3 with fast bowler Mark Wood (0-50) also squeezing the runs in his tidy four-over spell for 14 runs before struggling in his return spell with his left knee heavily strapped. Zadran, who returned to international cricket in this tournament after ankle surgery in September, and Shahidi (40) revived Afghanistan with a 103-run partnership. But Shahidi misjudged the length of leg-spinner Rashid while going for a reverse sweep and was clean bowled. Zadran pushed up the scoring rate with better than run-a-ball 72-run partnership with Omarzai, who made 41 off 31 balls. Zadran continued to bat with lot of determination and charged against Archer and Wood in the final 10 overs once he completed his century off 106 balls. He smashed Archer for 20 runs in one over with a straight six and followed it up with three cracking boundaries behind point as Afghanistan notched 113 runs off the final 60 balls. Nabi scored 40 with three sixes and two fours and Zadran smashed Archer for 20 runs in one over that featured straight six and three crisp boundaries behind point. Zadran surpassed Duckett's record of 165 made against Australia last Saturday with another attractive straight six against Archer as the fast bowler was smashed for 43 runs off his final five overs. ""I wanted to bat longer and longer and that 177 is a special moment for me,"" Zadran said. Wood also struggled in his four-over spell with pain in his knees and went for 36 runs off his four overs before Livingstone stepped in to bowl the final over. The spinner conceded just two runs and had Zadran caught at deep backward square leg and Nabi holed out at deep mid-wicket. ""They got away from us there in the last 10 overs,"" Buttler said. ""Credit to Ibrahim, he played a fantastic innings. If we look back and reflect, 113 off the last 10 pushed them up to a score that was a very good on that pitch.""","the, run, runs, rashid, balls, omarzai, zadran, root, archer, tournament, overs, his, wood, jamie, azmat, spell, hashmatullah, adil, shahidi, nabi"

The victory with nearly four overs to spare also advanced India to the semifinals and eliminated tournament host and defending champion Pakistan and Bangladesh from contention. Ravindra took a blow on the forehead in a game 16 days ago and missed the last three one-day internationals, but recovered to strike 112 off 105 balls and carry New Zealand to 240-5 in 46.1 overs in reply to Bangladesh's 236-9. Bangladesh's middle order capitulated against the off-spin of Michael Bracewell, who took 4-26 in 10 overs. Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto led with 77. The 25 extras were the fourth highest tally in the innings. Ravindra stands tall Fast bowlers Taskin Ahmed (1-28) and Nahid Rana (1-43) jolted New Zealand to 15-2 when Will Young, who made a century against Pakistan, went for a duck and Kane Williamson fell for rare consecutive single-digit scores in ODIs, 5 after 1. Taskin clean-bowled Young with a nip-backer into the right-hander and Williamson edged the tall Rana, whom New Zealand batters were facing for the first time in an international. But Ravindra combined with Devon Conway to revive the chase. They shared 57 in 12 overs before Pakistan's third pace bowler, Mustafizur Rahman, got Conway to chop on on 30. Tom Latham (55) then joined Ravindra and they shared a match-winning 129-run stand. The left-handers thwarted the pace of Nahid and were equally good against the spin of Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Rishad Hossain. Ravindra, who batted at No. 4 in place of Daryl Mitchell, got a lucky escape on 93 when Miraz couldn't hold onto a sharp low catch at point. He completed his fourth ODI century off 95 balls with 11 fours and a six. Ravindra was dropped again after his century by Mahmudullah at mid-on, and the batter finally holed out in the deep to give Rishad his only wicket. Latham was run out for 55, his third consecutive half-century, when New Zealand was just 23 runs shy of the target. Bracewell baffles batters Bracewell squeezed Bangladesh after its promising start in his unchanged 10-over spell. The off-spinner bowled 43 dot balls and conceded just one six and a boundary. Shanto struggled to up the ante in his 110-ball knock as he couldn't accelerate against Bracewell, who struck off his second ball when captain Mitchell Santner introduced the off-spinner inside the powerplay. Tanzid Hasan (24) got Bangladesh going with a 45-run opening stand with Shanto before Williamson made a diving catch as the batter tried to play Bracewell across the line. Bracewell dried up the runs and strangled the middle order with his deceptive pace, dismissing Towhid Hridoy (7), Mushfiqur Rahim (2) and Mahmudullah (4) cheaply. Hridoy, who scored a century against India in the first match, was brilliantly snapped up by Williamson over his shoulder when he ran backwards from cover. Bracewell caught Shanto after he top-edged O'Rourke. Jaker Ali (45) and Rishad Hossain (26) counterattacked against the pace, but New Zealand allowed them only 64 runs in the last 10 overs. On Tuesday, South Africa and Australia, which won their opening Group B games, face each other at the same venue.","the, century, overs, taskin, hossain, bracewell, mitchell, pace, santner, najmul, shanto, hasan, off, his, ahmed, balls, odi, spin, captain, fourth"

Fast bowler Mohammed Shami took 5-53 as Bangladesh was dismissed for 228 runs. At one stage, the Tigers were 35-5 in the ninth over but Towhid Hridoy's maiden international hundred helped them escape embarrassment. In reply, Gill steered India's chase with an eighth one-day international hundred and was unbeaten on 101 off 129 balls. India finished on 231-4 with 21 balls to spare. Gill hit nine fours and two sixes. He shared 69 off 59 balls with captain Rohit Sharma in an opening partnership that put India ahead of the run rate required, and 87 off 98 with Lokesh Rahul, who was 41 not out and hit the winning runs, a hook for six. ""Gill, we know the class he has,"" Sharma said. ""What he showed us, it shouldn't surprise anyone. What was good to see was he was there till the end."" Bangladesh won the toss and opted to bat at Dubai International Cricket Stadium but was in trouble immediately. Soumya Sarkar was caught behind off Shami in the first over. Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto was caught at short cover in the second over bowled by Harshit Rana. In the seventh over, Shami had Mehidy Hasan Miraz caught in the slips. The ninth should have ended Bangladesh. Tanzid Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim were caught behind and left-arm spinner Axar Patel was on a hat trick. The Champions Trophy has had one hat trick, 19 years ago. Patel induced an edge off Jaker Ali and the ball flew to the slips but Sharma dropped the regulation catch. ""I may take Axar for a dinner tomorrow,"" Sharma said. ""That was an easy catch, I should have taken that."" Instead of it being 35-6 inside the powerplay, Bangladesh earned a life and took advantage. Ali put on 154 runs off 206 balls with Hridoy for the sixth wicket as India stepped off the accelerator. Hridoy was also dropped by Hardik Pandya, in the 20th over off Kuldeep Yadav. Ali wasn't out until he reached 68 when he was caught at long on off Shami, who grabbed his 200th ODI wicket. Hridoy carried on and reached his hundred, not just his first in ODIs, but first in all formats. His 100 in 118 balls included six boundaries and two sixes. He and Ali helped Bangladesh cross 200 in the 45th over, but despite the team scoring 63 runs in the final 10 overs, the score was under par. ""The first powerplay, the way we batted, the game cost us at that point,"" Shanto said. ""Very hard for the lower order to recover. We were 25 to 30 runs short. The way Hridoy and Jaker batted was brilliant."" Beside Shami's sixth five-wicket haul in ODIs, on a turning pitch to boot, Rana took 3-31 and Patel 2-43. Gill and Rahul unbeaten Chasing 229, Sharma set the early pace and India raced to 50 off 48 balls. He was out caught at cover point in the 10th over. Virat Kohli scored 22 off 38 balls, helping India past 100, but then was caught off Rishad Hossain's leg spin. Shreyas Iyer and Patel fell cheaply and India was 144-4 in the 31st over after losing three wickets for 32 runs across 45 deliveries. Gill dropped anchor, reaching 50 off 69 balls. Rahul, too, made a sedate start at the other end, and enjoyed a life in the 37th over when he was dropped off Taskin Ahmed. Gill and Rahul avoided any further hiccups and cruised home. Gill reached his century off 125 balls, India's slowest in an ODI in six years. India next plays archrival Pakistan on Sunday, also in Dubai. Bangladesh will take on New Zealand in Rawalpindi on Monday.","balls, hossain, shami, the, runs, dubai, trophy, rishad, champions, axar, powerplay, najmul, shanto, shubman, gill, hasan, patel, hat, century, cover"

Latham smashed unbeaten 118 off 104 balls and Young hit 107 in New Zealand's total of 320-5 after Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan won the toss and elected to field. Glenn Phillips muscled 61 off 39 balls with his power-hitting in the death overs against the pace of Shaheen Shah Afridi (0-68) and Haris Rauf (2-83) that saw New Zealand rack up 113 runs in the last 10 overs. Pakistan struggled to get early momentum due to an injury to opening batter Fakhar Zaman before it got bowled out for 260 in 47.2 overs. Captain Mitchell Santner (3-66) and fast bowler Will O'Rourke (3-47) shared six wickets while Matt Henry clipped Pakistan in the powerplay and finished with 2-25. Babar Azam's struggle in his new role as an ODI opener continued as he made a scratchy 64 off 90 balls. It was only due to late countercharge by No. 7 Khushdil Shah (69 off 49 balls) that pushed Pakistan beyond 250-run mark in an otherwise disappointing batting by the top-order. ""The way Young and Latham rotated the strike and got the odd boundary, it really set us up,"" Santner said. ""We were thinking 260-280, but it shows what you can do if you have a platform and wickets in hand."" Pakistan, which co-hosted the World Cup with India and Sri Lanka in 1996, is the defending champion after it beat India in the final the last time the Champions Trophy was played - in England in 2017. New Zealand is on a high in Karachi after winning the tri-nation series in Pakistan last week. Zaman injury hits Pakistan Zaman walked off the field due to a muscular sprain in his left ribcage in the first over of the game as he ran after the ball in the outfield and fell awkwardly. He returned late in New Zealand's innings but, according to the rules, he wasn't allowed to open the innings until 20 minutes into Pakistan innings. Fast bowlers Henry and O'Rourke pinned down Pakistan to 22-2 in the first 10 overs with makeshift opener Saud Shakeel (6) and Mohammad Rizwan (3) both struggling to negotiate the pace. ""Losing Fakhar Zaman (as opener) was crucial,"" Rizwan said. ""We lost momentum twice, first in the death overs and then in the powerplay with the bat."" Shakeel sliced O'Rourke to third man and an airborne Phillips took a stunning left-handed catch at point to dismiss Rizwan as New Zealand shut down home team's chase early. Left-handed Zaman was visibly in discomfort and struggled to score 24 off 41 balls before he was clean bowled by Michael Bracewell (1-38) a ball after he got dropped by diving Devon Conway at mid-wicket. Babar's struggling knock finally ended in the 34th over when he top-edged a sweep against Santner as Pakistan continued to lose wickets with regular intervals before eventually getting bowled out with 16 balls to spare. Latham and Young stand tall Latham and Young rebuilt brilliantly with their 118-run stand after New Zealand ran into early trouble and lost the big wickets of Conway (10), in-form Kane Williamson (1) and Daryl Mitchell (10). Williamson, who had scored a century and a half-century in New Zealand's tri-nation series win in Pakistan last week, lasted for only two balls before he edged Naseem Shah (2-63) behind the wicket for his rare single digit score in ODIs. But Latham and Young then batted solidly in the middle overs as Young raised his fourth ODI century and first outside New Zealand with a sweep against leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed. Young, who smashed 12 fours and a flicked six off Naseem to mid-wicket in his 113-ball knock departed in the 38th over when he holed out in the deep, but setup an ideal platform for Phillips' blitz. ""The pitch was not easy to bat early on, but Will Young and Latham's innings were crucial,"" Rizwan said. ""We tried, but they played very smartly ... our execution in the end overs was not good, and that's why they made that score."" Latham, who used his feet well against spinners and swept with ease raised his century off 95 balls before Phillips took centerstage. Phillips was severe against the pace of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Rauf in the last seven overs and raised a brisk 124 runs stand with Latham. Pakistan was also behind the over-rate that cost it an additional fielder in the 30-yard circle in the last two overs. Rauf, who had earlier dismissed Mitchell with his deceptive pace, was erratic in his second spell before Phillips mistimed a reverse lap shot and was caught at short fine leg in the last over after striking four sixes and three fours.","overs, balls, the, century, zaman, zealand, latham, centuries, phillips, shah, babar, odi, his, khushdil, pakistan, innings, will, mitchell, abrar, yard"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/west-indies-levels-series-with-a-120-run-win-against-pakistan-in-2nd-test-within-three-days,West Indies levels series with a 120-run win against Pakistan in 2nd test within three days,Associated Press,2025-01-27 22:01:23,"MULTAN, JANUARY 27 West Indies spun out Pakistan for 133 on a rank turning pitch to record a series-leveling 120-run win inside three days of the second and final test on Monday. Pakistan, which needed a further 178 runs for an improbable win on its own engineered spinning wicket, fell quickly to Jomel Warrican's left-arm spin on Day 3 as the West Indies gained its first test win in Pakistan in over 34 years. ""We haven't won here in a while so to come here and do it as a young group is incredible,"" West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said, referring to the tourists' last win in Pakistan by seven wickets at Faisalabad in Nov. 1990. ""On this pitch, there's a ball with your name on it around the corner... it was a good experience. When you get on better pitches, you can have a similar mindset and it will help you in the long run."" Warrican claimed 5-27 to finish the series with a series-leading 19 wickets and also pushed Pakistan to the bottom of the World Test Championship table as both teams ended its two-year campaigns. Resuming at 76-4 Monday, Pakistan lost both overnight batters without adding to the total, as Kevin Sinclair (3-61) had Saud Shakeel caught in the slips off the third ball of the morning and Warrican clean bowled nightwatchman Kashif Ali in the next over. Mohammad Rizwan (25) and Salman Ali Agha (15) added 39 runs while trying to use their feet against the spinners before both fell to the left-arm spin of Warrican. Salman had already survived a close stumping chance off Warrican but was finally deceived by a looping delivery and was out lbw, while Rizwan couldn't read Warrican's brilliant delivery that spun back into him and knocked back the stumps. The spinner then wrapped up West Indies' famous win with more than an hour to go until lunch on Day 3 by clean bowling Sajid Khan. It was a remarkable turnaround for West Indies which lost the first test by 127 runs at the same venue and were 7-38 on Day 1 of the second test before its tailenders lifted them to 163 all out for a slender first innings lead of nine runs. Captain Kraigg Brathwaite's half century in the second innings then led West Indies to post 244 for an overall lead of 253 runs before Pakistan's batters fell into their own trap of a turning pitch against the tourists spinners. Pakistan captain Shan Masood believed his bowlers allowed the opposition's tailenders too many runs in the first innings and that pushed his team behind in the game. ""Yes, they batted well, but we have to learn too,"" Masood said. ""It's been a habit, it happened in South Africa as well."" West Indies finished eighth on the WTC table and Pakistan was at No. 9 with Australia and South Africa already qualifying for the final at Lord's in June. Masood defended Pakistan's ploy of making spin pitches which saw them using industrial-sized fans and patio heaters against both England and West Indies which earned them three successive home wins before Monday's defeat. ""We've won three out of four tests, but even in the game we've lost, on the first day we were in the position we wanted,"" he said. ""One bad performance can't have a domino effect. We still have to be brave and replicate conditions. ""Even when we fail, there are a lot of learnings. Now we realize as a team that one extra wicket, one extra partnership, can have a huge effect on the game.""","warrican, test, indies, kraigg, brathwaite, the, west, win, runs, jomel, ali, kashif, sajid, spin, tailenders, pitch, series, captain, pitches, masood"

Masood progressed to a defiant 137 off 232 balls and led Pakistan to 312-3 at lunch with Saud Shakeel getting a lucky escape and staying unbeaten on 16. South Africa enforced the follow-on after Pakistan collapsed to 194 on a dry wicket in reply to the home team's massive first innings score of 615. Shakeel could have been out leg before wicket to Kwena Maphaka in the penultimate over before the break, but South Africa didn't go for a television review against Indian on-field umpire Nitin Menon's not out decision. TV replays clearly showed the ball would have hit the leg stump of the left-hander and earned South Africa its third wicket of the session. But Masood stood firm and continued to lead Pakistan's strong fightback on Monday after sharing a record-breaking double century opening partnership with Babar Azam (81) that had anchored the tourists to 213-1 on Day 3. Nightwatchman Khurram Shahzad (18) frustrated South Africa in the morning before Marco Jansen (2-74) had him caught at point. Jansen came close to getting Kamran Ghulam (28) out without scoring in the same over, but David Bedingham missed a sitter in the first slip. Ghulam hit four boundaries but was undone by Kagiso Rabada's (1-81) off a delivery that just came back enough to hit the off stump as the batter attempted a loose drive and missed the line of the ball. Masood, resuming on 102, kept batting solidly against the pace and left-arm spin of Keshav Maharaj as the left-hander hit just two boundaries in the first session in his patient knock. South Africa sealed its place in June's World Test Championship final against Australia after narrowly beating Pakistan by two wickets in the first test at Centurion. Australia booked its place in the WTC final at Lord's after it clinched a six-wicket victory against India on Sunday in the fifth and final test at Sydney. Australia also regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with the 3-1 series win against India for the first time in 10 years.","test, the, masood, menon, nitin, khurram, nightwatchman, stump, rabada, kagiso, shan, pakistan, wicket, deficit, first, boundaries, kwena, sitter, maphaka, 232"

Pakistan, which was forced to follow on after 194 in the first innings, fought hard to avert an innings defeat with only 10 batters after Saim Ayub was injured on the first day. It was bowled out for 478 in the last session, leaving South Africa only 58 runs to win. David Bedingham and Aiden Markram knocked off the runs in just 7.1 overs to wrap up the series after their narrow two-wicket win at Centurion, also inside four days. ""It's satisfying, good old test cricket that we're used to,"" South Africa captain Temba Bavuma said. ""There was something for the new-ball bowlers and then it flattened out ... late on day four there was some spin and it's what we were accustomed to growing up."" Since beating the West Indies by 40 runs at Providence last August, South Africa has achieved 2-0 series wins against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan and qualified for its first World Test Championship final in June at Lord's. Ryan Rickelton's 259 in South Africa's decisive first innings total of 615 earned him the player of the match, but he didn't take the field on Monday because of a groin injury. Pakistan's long resistance on the flat, dry pitch was largely based on a determined century from captain Shan Masood, who batted for just over six hours before falling for 145 to 18-year-old debutant Kwena Maphaka after lunch. ""Maphaka is a guy who's super confident and wants to be in the contest,"" Bavuma said. ""He never had his head down and always wanted to make a play for the team."" Pakistan started the day on 213-1 and nightwatchman Khurram Shahzad frustrated South Africa in the morning before Marco Jansen had him caught at point on 18. Jansen came close to also dismissing Kamran Ghulam without scoring in the same over but Bedingham missed an easy catch at first slip. Ghulam hit four boundaries in a 28 but was undone by Kagiso Rabada off a delivery that just came back enough to hit the off stump as the batter attempted a loose drive and missed the line of the ball. The Proteas took the new ball after lunch and struck twice in the next two overs. Rabada found the outside edge of Saud Shakeel on 23 and the left-hander was caught in the slips, then South Africa got the big wicket of Masood. A successful lbw referral showed Maphaka's sharp delivery hit the Pakistan captain on the front pad. Masood helped to narrow the deficit to 109 but Pakistan was five wickets down with only four wickets left. Salman Ali Agha (48) and Mohammad Rizwan (41) survived close lbw reviews early in their innings before spinner Keshav Maharaj, who bowled long spells on Monday, dismissed both batters. No. 9 batter Mir Hamza (16) smashed Rabada for a straight six before he was the last man out, top-edging the pacer, who finished with 3-115. Maharaj (3-137) and Jansen (2-101) also helped as the South Africa bowlers had to grind out 122.1 overs. Bedingham opened the batting for the Proteas in the absence of the injured Rickelton and hit an unbeaten 44 off 30 balls with four boundaries and two sixes. ""With (our) backs against the wall we did well,"" Masood said. ""We didn't start off well and conceded too many runs initially, then we folded with the bat on a really nice surface. We need to learn how to land the first punch.""

Jansen (16 not out) overshadowed Abbas' brilliant figures of 6-54 with a square driven boundary against the fast bowler as South Africa reached 150-8 just after lunch on Day 4 and escaped with a close win in the opener of the two-match series. ""Quite an emotional moment for me, good advert for test cricket,"" said South Africa captain Temba Bavuma, who made 40. ""We haven't been ruthless but have found a way to ensure the result was on our side. Lot of joy and happiness on our side, a bit of a rollercoaster, glad that we were able to get the result."" Abbas, making a comeback after more than three years in the test wilderness, had knocked back South Africa's tricky chase of 148 runs in a marathon 13-over spell before lunch on Day 4 as the home team limped to 99-8, losing four wickets for three runs. However, Rabada changed gears in an unbroken 51-run stand with Jansen and made an unbeaten 31 off 26 balls with five fours to seal a memorable victory and denied Pakistan its first test win in South Africa in almost 18 years. South Africa had started this WTC cycle with a 1-1 drawn series against India before getting swept 2-0 in New Zealand. But since then the Proteas have beaten West Indies, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to stay on top of the table. ""It (WTC final) is a big one, not just for myself but also the team and the coach,"" Bavuma said. ""The way we started our campaign, against India and then New Zealand with a not-so-strong team, and the way we have gone through with our performances, not many gave us a chance."" India, Australia and Sri Lanka are the other teams still in contention for next June's WTC final against South Africa at Lord's. Captain Temba Bavuma (40) and Aiden Markram (37) had thwarted Abbas for an hour after South Africa resumed at a wobbly 27-3, still needing 121 for victory. Bavuma's controversial dismissal punctuated a South Africa collapse in the latter half of first session with Abbas grabbing three off his six balls in a sensational home team collapse. Bavuma, who made 40, surprisingly didn't request a television review when replays suggested that Abbas' ball had brushed the batter's pocket and didn't make contact with the inside edge of the bat but the South African skipper walked back to the dressing room. Abbas bowled an unchanged marathon spell of 13 overs, but had to wait as Markram and Bavuma saw off eight overs from the fast bowlers. Resuming at 27-3, Bavuma and Markram showed plenty of patience against Abbas' probing line and length before the fast bowler finally got the breakthrough after the first drinks break. Abbas was rewarded for his brilliant seam bowling when he beat the outside edge of Markram's bat and knocked back the off stump. Bavuma survived a couple of close chances when he successfully overturned an on-field lbw decision against him early in the day and Naseem Shah couldn't hold onto a sharp catch at fine leg as he overstepped the boundary cushion while grabbing the ball over his head. South Africa had controlled the game at 96-4 before Bavuma's dismissal saw Abbas finding the outside edges of David Bedingham (14) and Corbin Bosch's (0) bat off successive deliveries and in between Kyle Verreynne dragged Naseem Shah's delivery back onto his stumps. Abbas found the outside edge of Rabada's bat in his first over after lunch that fell just short of wicketkeeper Rizwan before both tailenders took the team home. ""Extremely proud of the efforts, but going forward we need to be ruthless,"" Pakistan captain Shan Masood said. ""We keep making the same mistakes but we have to get over the line, seize moments.""

Nissanka's 89, his seventh test fifty behind two centuries, easily shone in a steady effort by the top order to reduce the deficit to 116 runs by stumps. Unbeaten in the middle were Angelo Mathews, on 40 after becoming the third Sri Lankan man to pass 8,000 test runs, and Kamindu Mendis, on 30. South Africa started the day on 269-7 and Kyle Verreynne on 48. The prospect of reaching 300 looked difficult with the tail exposed and Sri Lanka brandishing the second new ball. But Verreynne was brilliantly supported by fast bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Dane Paterson to get the Proteas to a competitive 358, of which an unbeaten 105 was his.","africa, sri, verreynne, south, test, dane, paterson, bonus, 116, lankan, lanka, proteas, kyle, pathum, nissanka, rabada, kagiso, mathews, runs, kamindu"

The Sri Lankans, who have not lost three previous tests in Durban, won a crucial toss and opted to bowl in overcast conditions with a pace-heavy attack. Fast bowlers Asitha Fernando and Vishwa Fernando, no relation, removed the openers by the fourth over. Lahiru Kumara got the other two wickets and could have had captain Temba Bavuma on 20, but Kumara was no-balled for overstepping. Bavuma rode his luck to 28 and Kyle Verreynne was on 9 - they were a combined 26 off 21 balls - when stumps were called after a 3 1/2-hour wait. Aiden Markram, who has one century and one half-century in five previous tests this year, hit a couple of boundaries through cover and point in the first over but then edged Asitha Fernando to first slip on 9. Two balls later, fellow opener Tony de Zorzi gave a thick edge off Vishwa Fernando to second slip and South Africa was 14-2 in the fourth over. Tristan Stubbs was joined by Bavuma, who was dropped on 1 off Vishwa Fernando by Dimuth Karunaratne at second slip. With the sun out, Lahiru Kumara's first over went for 17 runs, including a couple of Stubbs boundaries, but he claimed Stubbs on 16 in his second over and Karunaratne made amends with the catch at third slip. When Kumara bowled David Bedingham at 54-4 in the 18th over, Kyle Verreynne came in. Verreynne and Bavuma plunded 17 runs off another over by Kumara, who should have made Bavuma his third wicket for a catch behind, but he was no-balled.","fernando, zorzi, durban, stubbs, tony, bavuma, lahiru, kumara, asitha, temba, slip, tests, catch, verreynne, tristan, bedingham, aiden, vishwa, sri, hour"

Root overtook Alastair Cook as England's top run-scorer in tests to make an unbeaten 176 and his Yorkshire teammate Harry Brook compiled a spectacular 141 not out off 173 balls on a placid pitch of Multan Cricket Stadium. The two have combined for a 243-run partnership, hitting 24 boundaries between them, and made Pakistan bowlers toil hard on a benign wicket which hasn't deteriorated over the last three days. England now trails Pakistan by 64 runs through its usual ""Bazball"" aggressive batting in 3 1/2 sessions, in comparison to the home team's score of 556 over 5 1/2 sessions. Root overcame cramps in intense hot weather to bat the entire day after resuming on 32. He also featured in two other century-stands with Ben Duckett (84) and Zak Crawley (78), who were the only wickets to fall in the first two sessions. ""It's pretty cool being out there in the middle with him (Root),"" Duckett said after sharing a 136-run partnership with Root. ""One of the greats of the game and certainly greats of English cricket."" Brook followed his 108 at the same venue two years ago, with another belligerent century as Pakistan couldn't separate his pairing with Root even after taking the second new ball. But Pakistan head coach Jason Gillespie hoped his fast bowlers will not let England run away with a meaningful lead when play resumes on Thursday. ""If we can take a couple of wickets early and get into their all-rounders, we can build from there,"" Gillespie said. ""We still have a ball that isn't too old. Our (fast) bowlers haven't had a heavy workload ... they'll come back ready to go, and we'll try to crack it open tomorrow morning."" However, both fast bowlers Naseem Shah (1-87) and Shaheen Shah Afridi (1-88) were ineffective after hardly finding any reverse swing with the old ball. Leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed also couldn't find any turn of the hard surface, which had some cracks, as England plundered the leggy for 0-174 off his 35 wicketless overs. Brook had a lucky escape on 75 in an otherwise flawless knock when Aamer Jamal's short ball gently rolled back to the stumps but didn't dislodge them after ricocheting off the batter's chest. Root survived two leg before wicket reviews in a patient knock of 277 balls. Naseem was mighty close to getting the England star batter lbw on 168 and Jamal went for unsuccessful television referral before Root had surpassed Cook's run-tally of 12,472 in the first session. Root crossed Cook's tally with a straight-driven boundary before lunch off Jamal to reach 71 and then completed his first test century in Pakistan with a reverse sweep after the break. Brook was aggressive from the onset and didn't hesitate to loft Abrar for a straight six as he raised his sixth test century - and fourth against Pakistan - off 118 balls with Pakistan captain Shan Masood running out of ideas to break the partnership. Both batters didn't give Pakistan any chance with the second new ball, taken in the latter half of the final session, as England scored at a brisk pace of 4.87 an over in a dominant day for the visitors. Earlier, Duckett recovered from a thumb injury which denied him opening England's first innings on Tuesday afternoon and smashed 84 off 75 balls before he was pinned lbw by Jamal when he came round the wicket to the left-hander in the second session. England lost the wicket of Crawley inside the first half hour when he chipped a catch of Afridi after adding 14 runs to his overnight score of 64. Jamal pounced on the opportunity on a second attempt at short mid-wicket as Crawley tried to whip the fast bowler on the on-side. But Root stayed calm and Brook showed plenty of aggression to take England into a dominant position.","century, the, cook, multan, bowlers, greats, gillespie, sessions, aamer, balls, test, cricket, abrar, his, jason, ball, fast, first, run, jamal"

Pakistan started the day on 328-4 and was spearheaded by Salman Ali Agha's unbeaten 104 and Saud Shakeel's 82. On a pitch which still looks good for batting with little help for fast bowlers or spinners, England raced at nearly five runs per over as Zac Crawley smashed 11 fours in his unbeaten 64. Joe Root was not out on 32. England lost stand-in captain Ollie Pope without scoring in the second over to a stunning one-handed catch by a diving Aamer Jamal at midwicket off Naseem Shah. England trails Pakistan by 460 runs. Pope had to open the innings after Ben Duckett injured his left thumb while grabbing a sharp chest-high catch of No. 11 Abrar Ahmed in the slips that finally ended England's sweaty 5 1/2 sessions on the field at humid Multan Stadium. Fast bowler Brydon Carse was hopeful Duckett will recover overnight and bat on day three. ""He's just taken a knock on his thumb, but he will be assessed overnight and he'll be back batting tomorrow,"" Carse said. England's Jack Leach took 3-160 and Shoaib Bashir 1-124 but Pakistan dominated both spinners. Carse's long wait for his first wicket in his debut test came on Tuesday, which he finished with 2-74. Gus Atkinson (2-99) and Chris Woakes (1-69) toiled without finding any reverse swing on the green square. ""Last two days have been immensely tough conditions for everyone out there,"" Carse said. ""We didn't get that much out of it (pitch) over the couple of days, but credit to the team and everyone for keep coming back in each session. There's some tired bodies in the camp at the moment, but the lads will rest up and come again tomorrow."" England did well in the first session and allowed Pakistan only 69 runs with Carse breaking the resistance of nightwatchman Naseem, who gloved a legside catch after his test-best 33. Naseem denied England a breakthrough for 1 1/2 hours and braved a couple of blows. He got a knock on the back of his helmet when he was struck hard by an Atkinson short ball and also received brief treatment when Carse struck the batter's right thumb off another short ball before round-the-wicket worked for the right arm fast bowler. Leach had Mohammad Rizwan caught at mid-off for a 12-ball duck. Shakeel, who began the day on 35, showed plenty of resistance and raised his half-century with a swept boundary off Bashir. Shakeel was undone by the off-spinner after lunch and feathered a low catch to Root in the slips. Agha, dropped early by Woakes on the boundary, took charge with meticulous drives and sweeps. His third test century followed tons by captain Shan Masood (151) and Abdullah Shafique (102) on day one. Agha gave Pakistan an ideal finish on the benign pitch. In the company of Shaheen Shah Afridi (26), Agha hit 10 boundaries and three sixes in his 119-ball knock to propel Pakistan past 500. ""I believe I can take on spinners, no matter what the situation is, and that's exactly what I did,"" Agha said. ""I have been playing (batting) with tailenders for the last two years, so when the tail comes it brings the best out of me."" England was scratchy late in Pakistan's innings as wicketkeeper Jamie Smith missed an easy stumping of Abrar, and Atkinson couldn't judge a catch over his shoulder before Root folded up the innings.","catch, the, thumb, multan, carse, century, test, aamer, leach, pitch, couple, his, agha, brydon, naseem, jamal, bashir, masood, shoaib, shan"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/ghulams-dream-debut-ton-on-recycled-wicket-carries-pakistan-to-259-5-in-2nd-test-against-england,Ghulam's dream debut ton on recycled wicket carries Pakistan to 259-5 in 2nd test against England,Associated Press,2024-10-15 22:01:03,"MULTAN, OCTOBER 15 Debutant Kamran Ghulam scored a resolute century on a tricky recycled wicket and carried Pakistan to 259-5 at stumps on Day 1 of the second test against England on Tuesday. Ghulam answered Pakistan's batting problems at No. 4 with a patient 118 off 224 balls. He became the 13th Pakistan batsman to score a century on test debut and is the first to do so against England. Off-spinner Shoaib Bashir (1-66) broke through Ghulam's defenses late in the final session when he tickled the leg bail with the second new ball just four overs old. Mohammad Rizwan, who could have been out caught behind early but England didn't go for the television referral, was unbeaten on 37 and first test century-maker Salman Ali Agha was 5 not out at stumps. The 29-year-old Ghulam had long been knocking at the doors of test cricket with 16 first class centuries before he was finally given a chance after Pakistan left out Babar Azam for the remaining two matches of the series because of his lean patch in red-ball cricket. ""Babar Azam is a legend, but on the back of my mind I was thinking to give my 110%,"" Ghulam said. ""I had waited for four years after scoring consistently in first class cricket. I wasn't worried about the wicket or the opposition, I just desperately wanted to get a chance and perform."" Ghulam reached his memorable century off 192 balls in the final session when he drove Joe Root to mid-wicket boundary for his ninth four. He knelt down and kissed the turf. England squeezed the runs early in the final session through some impeccable reverse swing of Brydon Carse (1-14 in 11 overs) and Matthew Potts (1-36 in 17 overs) as Pakistan lost Saud Shakeel cheaply when the left-hander got a thick edge off Carse. Jack Leach (2-92) had taken two wickets inside the first 45 minutes to give Pakistan an early shock at 19-2 after captain Shan Masood won the toss and elected to bat on a dry wicket tailor-made for Pakistan's spin-heavy bowling attack. Ghulam blunted the spin of Leach and Bashir by combining in a 149-run stand with Saim Ayub, who raised his third half century in the last four test matches and made 77. ""There was pressure when I walked out to bat because we had lost two quick wickets,"" Ghulam said. ""The ball was reversing good and it was also keeping low, but I was focused to do well and played with a positive frame of mind."" England captain Ben Stokes, back after two months out injured, kept on pressing for the breakthrough with an umbrella field in front of both sides of the wicket. It was without success before Ayub chipped an easy catch to Stokes at short mid-off at the stroke of tea interval. But Ghulam didn't feel the pressure and waited patiently for the loose balls to hit 11 fours and a six in his memorable debut before he was undone by Bashir. Earlier, Leach knocked back the off-stump of Abdullah Shafique (7) in his second over and Masood (3) fell to the trap of close-in fielders when Zak Crawley pounced on a low catch at short mid-wicket. England deployed both spinners with the new ball after just five overs after Pakistan opted to reuse the same wicket on which it suffered a historic innings and 47-run defeat in the first test last week. Potts, one of the two changes made by England, and Carse, virtually found no seam movement or swing on a dry wicket before Stokes turned to his spinners and even Root bowled two overs of off-spin before lunch. Ghulam struck a straight six against Leach in a show of rare aggression. Stokes, who missed England's 2-1 win at home against Sri Lanka and also last week's victory in Multan, replaced Chris Woakes. Fast bowler Gus Atkinson made way for Potts. Pakistan, which is on an 11-match winless streak at home, made four changes after it became the first test-playing nation to lose a match by an innings after scoring 500-plus runs in the first innings. Four senior players, including out-of-form Babar, were rested for the remaining two tests of the series. The spin trio of Sajid Khan, Noman Ali and Zahid Mahmood, who haven't played first-class cricket for nine months, were included in the playing XI with Agha and Ayub the other spin options for Pakistan.","the, test, ghulam, spin, wicket, century, first, ali, overs, cricket, debut, ball, multan, agha, two, four, bashir, masood, shoaib, shan"

Masood, who compiled his first test ton in four years, smashed 151 off 177 balls while Shafique made a fluent 102 to help the home team reach stumps on 328-4. England took three wickets in the final session, after Masood and Shafique had shared a huge stand of 253 for the second wicket as the visitors toiled in the searing heat of Multan. Saud Shakeel was unbeaten on 35 and nightwatchman Naseem Shah yet to score at the close of play. Fast bowler Gus Atkinson, playing his first overseas test, claimed 2-70 while Jack Leach, returning after a spell out of the team, picked up 1-61 on a wicket which had a tinge of grass but gave little assistance to pace or spin. Chris Woakes trapped Babar Azam lbw for 30 with the second new ball in the penultimate over of the day. Pakistan's former captain hasn't scored a half-century in his last 17 innings. Masood, who hit 13 fours and two sixes, and Shafique got on top of off-spinner Shoaib Bashir, who was wicket-less in his 18 overs and conceded 71 runs. ""The way Shan and I made the partnership, it was crucial for us,"" said Shafique. ""Red-ball cricket is not an easy game. The main thing I was focusing on was the process. If I do good things in the process then I'm able to do well in the match."" Debutant Brydon Carse twice came close to a wicket. Masood successfully overturned on-field umpire Kumar Dharmasena's lbw decision through a TV referral early in his knock, while stand-in skipper Ollie Pope couldn't hold onto a low catch at short cover off the same batter. Shafique also survived a run-out chance when Pope's under-arm throw from close range missed the stumps at the non-striker's end, with the batter well-short of his crease in the first session. Atkinson enjoyed early success when he had Saim Ayub (4) caught by keeper Jamie Smith down the leg side in his second over. England then had to wait until the final session when Shafique, struggling with cramp soon after reaching his hundred with a six over long-on, offered a tame catch in the covers and fell after hitting 10 fours and two sixes. Masood also struggled with cramp and followed Shafique when Leach grabbed a low return catch. Masood, whose last test century came against England in Manchester in 2020, had been under the microscope after losing five successive tests since he was appointed captain last year. Pakistan's top-order was also criticised after losing the home series to Bangladesh 2-0, during which Shafique scored 42 runs in four innings. Masood used his feet well against Bashir and pierced the gaps on the off side with precision against the pace bowlers as he reached his century after lunch off 102 balls. Both teams picked three fast bowlers and two spinners, with Pakistan including pacemen Aamer Jamal, returning from a back injury, Naseem and Shaheen Shah Afridi, along with slow bowlers Abrar Ahmed and Salman Ali Agha. England test captain Ben Stokes missed the series opener because of a hamstring injury, but he presented a maiden test cap to Durham team-mate Carse, who bowled consistently at 140mph early in his spell. It is the first test of a three-match series.","test, the, shafique, his, masood, dharmasena, pope, aamer, century, abrar, catch, captain, bowlers, multan, naseem, carse, shah, bashir, jamal, shoaib"

On a day when 17 wickets fell, India was dismissed for 376 early in the morning session with Ravichandran Ashwin hitting 113 and later reached 81-3 at stumps - for an overall lead of 308 - having decided against enforcing the follow-on. Shubman Gill was unbeaten on 33 and Rishabh Pant was 12 not out. In between all that, Bumrah ran through Bangladesh's lower-middle order in a fine all-round bowling performance by the Indians that bundled out the visitors early in the third session. Pacers Mohammed Siraj (2-30) and Akash Deep (2-19) weighed in with economical figures. Shakib al Hasan's 32 was the top score for Bangladesh, which slumped to 26-3 at lunch and couldn't stem the fall of wickets, losing two more quick after the resumption of play. Siraj had captain Najmul Hossain Shanto caught at slip for 20 before Bumrah dismissed Mushfiqur Rahim in a similar fashion for 8, leaving Bangladesh at 40-5 after 12.5 overs. Shakib and Litton Das resisted with a 51-run partnership for the sixth wicket. Das scored 22 off 42 balls, including three fours. Spin then did the trick for India as Ravindra Jadeja (2-19) removed Das, who was caught at square leg by substitute fielder Dhruv Jurel. Jadeja picked up a second when Shakib was caught at short leg two overs later. At 92-7, Bangladesh was staring down the barrel, though Mehidy Hasan Miraz scored 27 off 52 balls to save the team from complete embarrassment. He maneuvered the lower order to add another 57 runs for the final three wickets while also denying Bumrah a five-wicket haul. India's star-studded top-order faltered once again in the second innings. Rohit Sharma was caught at slip for 5, unable to fend off extra bounce from Taskin Ahmed (1-17). Yashasvi Jaiswal chased a wide delivery from Nahid Rana and was caught behind for 10, while Virat Kohli scored 17 runs - and added 39 for the third wicket with Gill - before falling lbw to Mehidy Hasan (1-16). Replays suggested an inside edge and Kohli didn't ask for a DRS review despite India having a full quota of three reviews available. Gill and Pant closed out the day without further damage. Bangladesh pace bowler Hasan Mahmud earlier picked up his second straight five-wicket haul in India's first innings, which saw Ashwin get to his sixth test hundred and a personal best at his home ground. After miscuing a pull to mid-off, Ashwin walked off to a rousing reception from his hometown crowd. Resuming on 339-6 from overnight, India lost Jadeja early, caught behind for 86 off 124 balls. That ended the 199-run seventh-wicket partnership with Ashwin which had turned things around for India from a precarious 144-6 on the first day. Mahmud finished with 5-83, becoming the first Bangladesh bowler with a five-wicket haul in India. It was also his second five-wicket performance in as many innings after he took 5-43 against Pakistan in Rawalpindi. Taskin Ahmed had figures of 3-55. The second of two tests will be played in Kanpur and begins on Sept. 27, with three Twenty20 matches to follow.","hasan, wicket, the, bangladesh, innings, dhruv, jurel, mahmud, mehidy, najmul, siraj, first, shanto, hossain, balls, test, day, mohammed, order, runs"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/indias-modi-focuses-on-jobs-creation-in-first-budget-after-winning-polls,India's Modi focuses on jobs creation in first budget after winning polls,Associated Press,2024-07-23 14:34:26,"NEW DELHI, JULY 23 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's newly formed government presented an annual budget to Parliament that raises spending to generate more jobs and spur economic growth, while aiming to appease coalition partners it needs to stay in power. In her budget speech Tuesday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government is focused on driving domestic growth through jobs, training and small businesses. India's inflation rate is stable and moving toward the government's 4% target, she said, while the economy grew at a sizzling 8.2% rate in the last fiscal year. ""India's economic growth continues to be the shining exception and will remain so in the years ahead,"" Sitharaman said. More than a decade after he first took office as prime minister, Modi is under pressure to generate more jobs to help sustain growth. The proposed budget includes a $24 billion package for job creation over the next five years and raises spending on loans for small and medium-size businesses. It allocates $18 billion to support agriculture and farm technology, such as climate-resilient seed varieties. It also would raise spending, to $133 billion, on construction of thirty million homes for the poor, schools, airports, highways and other infrastructure. The budget would cut taxes on big corporations and allocate more funds to two states, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, that are governed by the Modi government's biggest coalition partners. The government plans to build new airports, medical colleges and sports and tourism facilities in eastern India's Bihar state, which is ruled by the Janata Dal (United) party. Sitharaman also announced special financial support for southern India's Andhra Pradesh state, ruled by the Telugu Desam party. Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party is relying on those two regional parties to keep its coalition government in power after it failed to win a majority on its own in recent national elections. India's economy - the fifth largest in the world - is projected to grow at an annual rate of between 6.5% to 7% in the fiscal year ending in March 2025. But experts say the benefits of its rapid growth are shared unequally, as wealth of already affluent Indians has risen steadily without reaching the the majority of Indians who toil in the country's large informal sector, where the quality of jobs is poor and precarious. Billions of dollars worth of subsidies to manufacturing have not led to creation of enough jobs. To mitigate rising unemployment, the government said it will provide 12-month paid internship opportunities to 10 million young people in India's top 500 companies for a five-year period. Sitharaman said the training cost will be borne by the companies. According to the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy, youth unemployment was at 9.2% in early July, underscoring the challenge of delivering jobs in the world's most populous country, where millions graduate every year. Inequality has surged in India in the last decade. According to a report by World Inequality Lab, wealth concentrated in the richest 1% of India's population is at its highest in six decades. The government is aiming for a fiscal deficit of 4.9% of India's gross domestic product for the 2024-25 financial year, lower than the 5.1% figure in February's short-term budget, Sitharaman said. India is one of the highest current sources of emissions that lead to global warming, but the government announced plans Tuesday to set up a new 800-megawatt coal-fired thermal power plant. Sitharaman said the government will also support development of small and modular nuclear reactors to help meet India's future energy demand. The budget also allocates $1.37 billion to address damage from floods. India, which is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts, has suffered an increase in flooding due to extreme rains and glacier melt in the last few years. The budget requires approval from both houses of Parliament, but it is bound to be enacted as Modi's coalition government holds a majority.","the, budget, india, modi, economy, coalition, janata, andhra, telugu, nirmala, sitharaman, desam, government, growth, year, jobs, megawatt, fiscal, dal, pradesh"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/prime-minister-olis-visit-to-the-us-heading-for-a-mixed-accomplishment,Prime Minister Oli's visit to the US: Heading for a mixed accomplishment?,Jiba Raj Pokharel,2024-09-25 11:39:51,"Prime Minister K P Oli has embarked on a 10-day visit to the United States beginning from September 20 to participate in the 79th session of the General Assembly at the United Nations headquarters. He is accompanied by Minister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Deuba Rana who has shot into prominence recently by being able to complete a successful visit to neighbouring India marked by the meeting with the Prime Minister, a privilege which few foreign ministers enjoyed in the past. Along the sidelines, his programme is to meet the world leaders, including the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, and Chief Advisor of Bangladesh Mohammad Yunus, also a Noble Peace Laureate. Yunus has emerged into the political scene following a three-month-long nationwide protest. It was so violent that it led to the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hassina, leading to self-imposed exile in neighbouring India despite riding on the crest of a two-thirds majority. The objectives of the visit are two-fold. Firstly, it is to highlight the problems of the climate change before the UN Assembly that has dealt fatal blows to the already sagging and fragile economy of the country. The spotlight will be on the flood caused by the glacial lake outburst on the picturesque village of Thame, the birthplace of an illustrious personality like Tenzing Norgay who scaled Mount Everest, the highest peak of the world, with Edmund Hillary of New Zealand. Secondly, it is to address the Nepali community as well as the University of Columbia, highlighting on the Journey of Nepal's Democracy and Economic Prosperity. Such visits have been undertaken regularly in the past, but they have left much to be desired. One of the examples is the visit of Prime Minister Prachanda last year. Prachanda had planned to tour with a Jumbo team initially and had to trim down the numbers to calm down the criticism. His address to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit as the head of the Least Developed Countries followed by the one in the United Nations General Assembly were not considered to be as innovative as they should have been. It may be remembered that he tried to project the problems Nepal is facing due to climate change despite its zero contribution to carbon emission, which is held responsible for the burgeoning climate change problem. In fact, it had already obtained the world's attention following the visit of the United Nations General Secretary Antonio Guterres to Nepal. He had addressed the Nepali Parliament after flying past Mount Everest and visiting the base camp of Mount Annapurna. Moreover, his two-week-long visit to China as if cruising for a personal vacation was considered to be too long, giving the impression that the Prime Minister had no pressing problems at home. Oli's visit has, however, met with initial success due to the meeting already held with Indian Prime Minister Modi, the first of its kind after he became the Prime Minister leading a coalition government of the Nepali Congress (NC) and the Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) parties. This coalition of two large political parties has raised political eye brows as they usually share opposite benches in the Parliament. No wonder then that the opposition, the Maoist Centre, has labelled it as coming together to cover up the corruption allegations made against the two leaders – Oli and Sher Bahadur Deuba – on the Giri Bandhu and Wide body scams. Oli and Modi agreed on resolving the outstanding problems by creating a suitable machinery in the future. Modi said that they had a good meeting focussing on issues such as energy, technology and trade. He further opined that Nepal-India friendship was very robust and looked forward to adding more momentum to the existing ties. Modi has also reportedly agreed to visit Nepal on a convenient date. It has brought great relief to the government camp, in general, and the UML, in particular, as Prime Minister Oli has not received any invitation from India after becoming the Prime Minister in view of the age-old tradition of first visiting India after assuming the coveted position. Moreover, the Indian government is said to be disappointed with Nepal and more with Prime Minister Oli for raising the issue of the pointed map unilaterally without proper political dialogue with India. It has been held responsible for the unwillingness of India to receive the report prepared by Eminent Persons Group (EPG) which was formed with the mutual agreement between India and Nepal. Oli's visit to US will be successful if he can raise the climate change issue effectively and not as a mere eye wash as has been the case in the past. The carbon emitting countries, because of their excessive use of fossil fuels, are reluctant to fund countries like Nepal that have been facing daunting problems. Moreover, it remains to be seen how he will present Nepal's journey to Democracy and Economic Prosperity. Democracy is about giving high regard to the rule of the law, but Oli has undermined the Supreme Court verdict by dissolving the House on two occasions when the court had declared it unconstitutional in the first instance. That bad governance dominated by corruption has been a stumbling block for attaining economic prosperity is accepted by all alike in the country. But the delay in addressing it after Oli came to power when it had generated some momentum in the last government's tenure headed by prime minister Prachanda coupled with the agreement signed between the UML and NC at midnight as if to avoid corruption charges alleged against these parties do not auger well towards this end. When judged against the glaring realities, Oli's visit may be at best a mixed one marked by initial success with failure following it.","the, prime, prosperity, visit, minister, problems, oli, hassina, leninist, journey, noble, marxist, two, bandhu, united, court, climate, nations, change, deuba"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/how-a-student-run-uprising-led-to-the-ouster-of-bangladeshs-longest-serving-prime-minister,How a student-run uprising led to the ouster of Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister,Associated Press,2024-08-06 21:27:03,"NEW DELHI, AUGUST 6 In a video that lit up social media feeds in Bangladesh, jubilant protesters climbed atop a statue of Sheikh Mujib Rahman, the country's first leader after independence, and beat it with iron rods and axes as people below hooted and cheered. Crowds across the nation have attacked symbols of Rahman, as they sought to literally dismantle his legacy and that of his daughter, Sheikh Hasina, the country's prime minister until Monday when she resigned and fled in the face of the unrest. The anger that pushed Hasina from power - and that is behind the drive to erase her and her family - is rooted in deep economic distress felt by the majority of people in Bangladesh, as well as the perception that while they suffered, the elites aligned with Hasina prospered, analysts said. ""It created a deep-seated resentment against the government,"" said Ali Riaz, an expert on Bangladeshi politics who teaches political science at Illinois State University. That eventually triggered a full-scale rejection of Hasina and her increasingly autocratic turn. Monday's extraordinary scenes - when crowds ransacked her official residence, her party offices and a museum to her father while she fled to India in a helicopter - capped weeks of protests that began with discontent over a quota system for allocating government jobs that critics said favored those with connections to Hasina's party. Hundreds of people were killed as security forces cracked down on the demonstrations - violence that only fueled them, even after the quota system was dramatically scaled back. It showed that her government ""wildly underestimated just how much anger there was among the public, and the sources of the anger which went beyond the issue of job quotas,"" said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. The 76-year-old, the longest-serving prime minister in the predominantly Muslim country of 170 million, has prided herself on how she transformed Bangladesh's economy into a global competitor - fields turned into garment factories, bumpy roads became winding highways, more girls went to school, and electricity reached rural villages. But that transformation was not shared by all and it belied fragilities in the economy, like its dependence on exports and persistently high youth unemployment. Those were exposed after the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine drove her government to seek a $4.7 billion IMF bailout. Eighteen million young people - almost a fifth of the population - are not working or in school, according to Chietigj Bajpaee, who researches South Asia at the Chatham House think tank. And the fact that the allocation of government jobs was at the center of the initial protests is no coincidence: They were seen as most stable and high-paying, revealing the widespread insecurity that persisted. Under Hasina, ""the benefits of growth were limited to a small elite in or close to the regime,"" said Uday Chandra, assistant professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar. Critics also complained she touted the economic advances to cover up her crackdown on dissent, accusing her of curtailing press freedoms, shrinking civil society and jailing thousands of opposition members ahead of the January election in which she won a fourth consecutive term. The economic successes were ""inflated to justify her rule, and to try and push development as an alternative to democracy,"" Riaz said, adding that allegations of vote-rigging and a boycott by the main opposition parties in the past three elections contributed to a sense that she lacked legitimacy. For now, Hasina's departure is being seen as a resounding victory for the protesters. ""Everyone is celebrating,"" shouted Juairia Karim, a student, as she rejoiced with others in the streets Monday. ""This has to be a historical day."" But Hasina's ouster has also plunged the nation into uncertainty. The ceremonial president dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, as he and the military chief promised to announce an interim government that would lead the country until new elections can be held. It's not clear how long that process could take - but it could be months or years. The president also released Hasina's archrival, Khaleda Zia, the chief of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, from house arrest where she languished for years. Meanwhile, student protesters demanded that Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus - a longtime opponent of Hasina - be put in charge of the interim government. He could not immediately be reached for comment, but one student leader said Yunus has agreed to step in. As for Hasina, it's unclear what's next. On Tuesday, India's foreign minister confirmed that she had arrived in the country the day before but did not say whether she would stay or head elsewhere. And more unrest could yet come - especially if the influential military attempts to go beyond its role of mediator. Bangladesh has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. ""In a fraught political environment, uncertainty can breed volatility and volatility can provoke more violence,"" said Kugelman, of the Wilson Center. ""The last thing Bangladesh can afford right now is a broader security crisis ... and this will come down to what role the army plays in addressing the serious threats to stability.""","the, hasina, her, anger, mujib, party, protesters, bangladesh, chatham, student, ouster, house, opposition, rahman, nobel, yunus, center, muhammad, unrest, government"

The failed coup was a watershed moment, not only for its immediate impact but also for its lasting implications on Türkiye's political, social, and economic landscape. The Night of the Coup On the night of 15 July 2016, a faction within the Armed Forces, who are affiliated with Fethullahist Terrorist Organization (FETÖ), attempted to overthrow the legitimate and democratically elected Turkish Government. Tanks rolled onto the streets of major cities, fighter jets roared overhead, and soldiers took control of key infrastructures, including bridges, airports, and media outlets. The coup plotters, ironically claiming ""to protect democracy and secularism"", faced immediate and fierce resistance from loyal military units, police forces, and, notably, ordinary citizens who heeded President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's leadership and His call to take to the streets. The night ended with over 250 people dead and more than 2,000 injured. By the morning of 16 July, the Turkish Government had regained control, and the coup attempt was quashed. The images of civilians standing in front of tanks and confronting armed soldiers became iconic symbols of the people's resistance. Commemoration and Legacy Each year, 15 July is commemorated as Democracy and National Unity Day in Türkiye. Ceremonies and events are held across the country to honor the heroes who fell for their country and celebrate the resilience of the Turkish Nation. The anniversary serves as a reminder of the robustness of democracy and the importance of vigilance against threats to national sovereignty, stemming from terrorist organizations such as FETÖ. The fight against FETÖ continues worldwide The sacrifice of the Turkish Nation ensured victory against the enemies of democracy that night. However, efforts to completely eliminate the FETÖ threat continue all over the world. FETÖ's network had reached throughout more than 160 countries since 1990s, via so-called educational institutions, health centers, business and media outfits. Contrary to their ""innocent"" and ""altruistic"" appearance, these institutions are exploited by FETÖ members to undermine the country they have nested for their own interests. Moreover, FETÖ presents an essential threat to the Muslim communities in the countries other than Türkiye, since they abuse the religious sentiments of Muslims who are unaware of their cultist agenda. Türkiye's fight to disrupt and defeat FETÖ's vile schemes continue unabatedly for long time. Thanks to these efforts, the whole world is much more sensitive and conscious about FETÖ than in the past. The awareness on FETÖ by friendly countries strengthened the cooperation between Turkish Government and their governments and this cooperation has led to the either the closure of FETÖ structures or their transfer to Turkish authorities. Maarif Foundation's efforts The contributions of Maarif Foundation, the sole entity authorized by the Turkish Government to provide educational services abroad, deserve to be especially lauded in this process, since education is the top priority area and a vital front to defeat FETÖ. Through Maarif Schools, students can access to an official and competent education, on contrary to the questionable education that FETÖ schools offer with questionable staff. In this regard, so far, the Maarif Foundation has achieved to take over 228 schools from FETÖ in 20 countries. Additionally, Maarif Foundation has established 215 new schools around the world. Currently, around 53 thousand students receive education at 443 schools, 1 university and 21 education centers under Maarif Foundation. The Importance of Türkiye-Nepal Cooperation against FETÖ Since the coup attempt, Turkish Government has increased its diplomatic efforts to raise the awareness of the Nepalese Government, against FETÖ's presence in the country. By virtue of the cooperation between Turkish and Nepalese authorities, the influence of FETÖ in Nepal was diminished in the past years. We are looking forward to strengthen our cooperation in countering terrorism, especially against FETÖ, with our Nepalese friends in the future as well. Conclusion As Türkiye marks the eighth anniversary of the coup attempt, it stands at a crossroads, reflecting on its past and contemplating its future. The events of 15 July 2016 have left an indelible mark on the nation's psyche, serving as a stark reminder of the price of freedom and the enduring spirit of its people. However, the fight of Turkish Nation against FETÖ, which is still lurking in other parts of the world, continues. Thus, we expect friendly countries to support our efforts in eradicating this terrorist organization once and for all.","fetö, the, coup, turkish, maarif, türkiye, schools, anniversary, cooperation, nation, attempt, night, foundation, terrorist, importance, erdoğan, tayyip, recep, fight, nepalese"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/donald-trump-appeared-to-be-the-target-of-an-assassination-attempt-heres-what-to-know,Donald Trump appeared to be the target of an assassination attempt. Here's what to know,,2024-07-14 12:34:51,"WASHINGTON, JULY 14 What began as a jubilant rally Saturday for Donald Trump days before he becomes the official Republican presidential nominee ended in mere minutes with the former president bloodied and a suspected would-be assassin shot dead by the Secret Service. There was also one spectator killed and two others who were critically injured in the shooting at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The former president was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the shots, at least five, were fired. Trump was seen holding his ear and got down on the ground. Agents quickly created a shield around him. When he finally stood, his face bloodied, he pumped his fist to cheering supporters. Trump and his motorcade left the scene and he was checked into a medical facility. The attack was the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. Here's a look at what we know so far: What is Trump's condition? Steven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, released a statement Saturday evening that Trump was fine and being looked at at a medical facility. Trump also released a statement on his Truth Social platform thanking the Secret Service and all law enforcement. ""I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,"" he wrote. ""Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!"" Trump also extended his condolences to the family of the person killed at the rally. Trump flew to New Jersey after visiting the Pennsylvania hospital, landing shortly after midnight at Newark Liberty International Airport. Who is handling the investigation? The FBI is set to lead the investigation and said its working with the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle briefed President Joe Biden and are working with law enforcement partners to respond to and investigate the shooting, Mayorkas said on X. ""We are engaged with President Biden, former President Trump, and their campaigns, and are taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security."" Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson also said the House will conduct a full investigation of the attack on Trump's campaign rally. ""The American people deserve to know the truth,"" Johnson said. ""We will have Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle and other appropriate officials from DHS and the FBI appear for a hearing before our committees ASAP."" What do we know about the shooter? The FBI early Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter, who fired from an elevated position outside the rally venue, a farm show. The shooter had fired multiple shots from ""an elevated position outside of the rally venue,"" the U.S. Secret Service said in a statement. Two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation said the shooter was engaged by members of the U.S. Secret Service counterassault team. The heavily armed tactical team travels everywhere with the president and major party nominees and is meant to confront any active threats while other agents focus on safeguarding and evacuating the person at the center of protection. Law enforcement recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person was not authorized to discuss details of the investigation. Why was Trump in Butler? Trump was holding his final rally ahead of the Republican National Convention that begins Monday in Milwaukee. Pennsylvania is one of the most important states in the presidential race and Trump has had at least two rallies in the state this year so far. The convention is slated to continue despite the shooting and Trump advisers said he looks forward to attending. What has been the reaction to the shooting? The overall response from both sides of the aisle was one of gratitude that Trump wasn't hurt, highlighting the issue of gun violence in America. Former lawmakers and presidents including Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as well as the foundation set up by 99-year-old Jimmy Carter, were also appreciative that the outcome wasn't worse. Several of Trump's fellow party members sent well wishes and prayers. Trump's possible running mates - North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. JD Vance - also sent statements. Even as the motivation behind the shooting wasn't clear, Vance and some other Republicans assigned blame to the Biden campaign's anti-Trump rhetoric. ""Today is not just some isolated incident,"" Vance wrote on X. ""The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination."" Biden spoke in a press briefing roughly three hours after the shooting. He said ""everybody must condemn"" the suspected assassination attempt. He said he had been unable to reach Trump before his remarks but did speak to Trump several hours later, according to the White House.","the, secret, trump, service, president, enforcement, rally, shooter, kimberly, cheatle, biden, assassination, law, republican, truth, burgum, mayorkas, fbi, dakota, shots"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/asias-richest-man-mukesh-ambani-is-set-to-throw-a-grand-wedding-for-his-son-heres-what-to-know,Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani is set to throw a grand wedding for his son. Here's what to know,Associated Press,2024-07-07 22:53:05,"NEW DELHI, JULY 7 In March, Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani threw a three-day prenuptial bash for his son that included a 1,200-person guest list, including former world leaders, tech tycoons and Bollywood's megastars, and a performance by renowned singer Rihanna. It was only the start of their months-long lavish pre-wedding celebrations which have grabbed headlines and set off a social media frenzy. In May, the family took guests on a 3-day pre-wedding cruise from Italy to France, which included a DJ set from David Guetta, Katy Perry belting out her hit song ""Firework"" and a performance by Pitbull to cap it off, according to media reports. Finally, the wedding is set for next week, with Anant Ambani, 29, marrying his longtime girlfriend, Radhika Merchant, in what many have dubbed the wedding of the year. Here's what we know: Who are the Ambanis? The father of the groom is Mukesh Ambani, 66, currently the world's 9th richest man with a net worth of $116 billion, according to Forbes. He is also the richest person in Asia. His Reliance Industries is a massive conglomerate, reporting over $100 billion in annual revenue, with interests ranging from petrochemicals, and oil and gas to telecoms and retail. The Ambani family owns, among other assets, a 27-story private apartment building, named Antila, worth $1 billion in Mumbai. It has three helipads, a 160-car garage, a private movie theater, a swimming pool, and a fitness center. Ambani's critics say his company has flourished mainly because of political connections during the Congress governments in the 1970s and 80s and subsequently under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rule after 2014. They say ""crony capitalism"" in India has helped certain corporations, such as Ambani's, thrive. The family patriarch has started passing the torch to his two sons and daughter. The oldest son, Akash Ambani, is now chairperson of Reliance Jio, their telecoms business; his daughter, Isha, oversees retail, while the groom Anant, the youngest, has been inducted into the new energy business. Who are the bride and groom? Anant has a bachelor's degree from Brown University, according to Reliance Industries' website, and oversees the conglomerate's renewable and green energy expansion. He also runs a 3,000-acre (nearly 1,200-hectare) animal rescue center called Vantara in Gujarat state's Jamnagar, the family's hometown where guests in March spent days celebrating in the extravagant pre-wedding party. The bride, Radhika Merchant, 29, is the daughter of pharmaceutical tycoon Viren Merchant and is the marketing director for his company, Encore Healthcare, according to Vogue. She told the magazine that the two were introduced through mutual friends in 2017. ""That first meeting just sparked something special between us, and it wasn't long before we started dating,"" she said. When's the wedding and what's expected? The main wedding ceremony is set for July 12, followed by a grand reception on July 14, according to local media. Celebrations are expected to be split between the Ambani's Jio World Convention Center in Mumbai city and their family home. The dates were reportedly chosen based on the couple's birth charts, as is typical in Hindu custom, and deemed auspicious. Also keeping with tradition, the wedding will be preceded by days of traditional wedding events and rituals. On Friday, Indian social media was abuzz with videos from the couple's sangeet, a ceremony where the bride and groom's families perform dances for the guests. It also included performances by Bollywood stars like Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh and Salman Khan as well as Justin Bieber, who flew to Mumbai for the event, according to local media. The family also organized a mass wedding for more than 50 underprivileged couples last week, as part of the pre-wedding celebrations. Extravagant parties are the Ambanis' specialty and next week's events are expected to draw more celebrities, billionaires and world leaders. In March for the pre-wedding bash, the guest list included Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, former leaders of Canada and Qatar as well as Bollywood's A-list stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone. In addition to Rihanna, Akon and Diljit Dosanjh, a Punjabi singer who shot to international fame when he performed at Coachella, also took the stage. In 2018, when his daughter married, Ambani made the headlines because of the grand celebrations, with pop sensation Beyoncé performing at the pre-wedding festivities. At the time, former U.S. Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among those who rubbed shoulders with Indian celebrities and Bollywood stars in the western Indian city of Udaipur.","wedding, ambani, the, reliance, pre, jio, bride, groom, industries, celebrations, family, merchant, bollywood, center, anant, conglomerate, acre, hectare, viren, ambanis"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/what-to-know-about-vladimir-putins-visit-to-china,What to know about Vladimir Putin's visit to China,Associated Press,2024-05-17 22:09:32,"BEIJING, MAY 17 Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China starting Thursday underlines an increasingly close partnership between the two allies who oppose the U.S.-led democratic order. China, led by President Xi Jinping, has offered robust diplomatic support to Moscow after its invasion of Ukraine and has emerged as a top export market for Russian oil and gas, helping fill the Kremlin's war coffers. Russia also has relied on China as the main source of high-tech imports to keep its military machine running. Once Communist rivals, the two countries that share a 4,200-kilometer (2,600-mile) border have become closer in recent years. A look at that relationship: 'DEAR FRIENDS' Putin and Xi have met over 40 times and developed strong personal ties to bolster their ""strategic partnership"" as they both face soaring tensions with the West. Xi last traveled to Moscow in March 2023, where they addressed each other as ""dear friend"" and exchanged compliments. Putin went to Beijing in October for a summit of China's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Putin told China's official news agency Xinhua before Thursday's two-day visit that his meetings with Xi are ""a dialogue between old friends"" and a ""fruitful exchange of views on the most topical issues on the bilateral and international agenda."" A PARTNERSHIP AGAINST THE WEST Putin said he chose China for his first trip abroad after being inaugurated to a fifth term in office this month because of the ""unprecedented level of strategic partnership between our countries."" Beijing has declared it a ""no-limits"" friendship. Both Xi and Putin see Western efforts to spread democracy as an attempt to de-legitimize them, and they believe that authoritarian regimes are better for confronting the challenges of the modern world. While China hasn't provided Russia with arms to use in Ukraine, it has backed Moscow diplomatically, blaming the West for threatening Russia's security. China also has strongly condemned Western sanctions against Moscow. Russia, in turn, has consistently voiced support for Beijing on issues related to Taiwan. After Kyiv's Western allies halted oil and gas imports from Russia, China has become Moscow's top energy customer. China, in turn, has become a top supplier of machinery and electronics to Russia after sanctions curtailed high-tech supplies. FEEDING RUSSIA'S WAR MACHINE The U.S. says China has greatly expanded supplies of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology to Russia that is used to make missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weapons. According to U.S. assessments, Russia got about 90% of all microelectronics and about 70% of machine tools from China in 2023. While visiting Beijing last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that ""Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China's support."" He said he told Chinese officials that ""if China does not address this problem, we will."" MILITARY COOPERATION Amid their strengthening ties, Russia and China have held a series of war games in recent years, including naval drills and patrols by long-range bombers over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. Russian and Chinese ground forces also have gone to each other's territory for joint exercises. Putin said Moscow has been sharing highly sensitive military technology with China that significantly bolstered its defense capability, including an early warning system to spot ballistic missile launches. The ground-based radar and satellites previously were only used by Russia and the U.S. In November, Putin suggested that Moscow and Beijing should expand cooperation on military satellites and other technology used for defense. CHINA'S VIEW ON UKRAINE China proclaims its neutrality in the Ukrainian conflict, but it also refuses to condemn Russia's action or even call it an invasion. Beijing blames the hostilities on the West and also strongly criticizes economic sanctions on Russia. Last year, Beijing proposed a 12-point peace plan that echoed Moscow's arguments and would secure Russia's territorial gains. It was quickly rejected by Ukraine and the West. China also has turned a cold shoulder to a Ukraine peace conference that is set to be hosted by Switzerland in June and snubs Russia. Beijing has said it supports a conference that's accepted by both Russia and Ukraine.","putin, machine, china, russia, partnership, vladimir, military, dear, the, friends, sea, war, kilometer, imports, russian, sanctions, mile, tech, jinping, visit"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/on-the-eve-of-his-visit-to-china-putin-says-russia-is-prepared-to-negotiate-over-ukraine,"On the eve of his visit to China, Putin says Russia is prepared to negotiate over Ukraine",Associated Press,2024-05-15 22:58:40,"BEIJING, MAY 15 Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Kremlin is prepared to negotiate over the conflict in Ukraine in an interview with Chinese media on the eve of visit to partner Beijing that has backed Moscow in its full-scale invasion of its neighbor. ""We are open to a dialogue on Ukraine, but such negotiations must take into account the interests of all countries involved in the conflict, including ours,"" Putin was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua News Agency on Wednesday. The Russian leader's two-day trip starting Thursday comes as his country's forces have pressed an offensive in northeastern Ukraine's Kharkiv region that began last week in the most significant border incursion since the full-scale invasion began, forcing almost 8,000 people to flee their homes. Along with Moscow's efforts to build on its gains in the nearby Donetsk region, the 2-year-old war has entered a critical stage for Ukraine's depleted military that is awaiting new supplies of anti-aircraft missiles and artillery shells from the United States. ""We have never refused to negotiate,"" Putin was quoted as saying by Xinhua. ""We are seeking a comprehensive, sustainable and just settlement of this conflict through peaceful means. We are open to a dialogue on Ukraine, but such negotiations must take into account the interests of all countries involved in the conflict, including ours."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said any negotiations must include a restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression, and security guarantees for Ukraine. China claims to take a neutral position in the conflict, but has backed Moscow's contentions that Russia was provoked into attacking Ukraine by the West, despite Putin's public avowals of his desire to restore Russia's century-old borders as the reason for his assault. Putin has blamed the West for the failure of negotiations in the opening weeks of the war and praised China's peace plan for Ukraine that would allow Moscow to cement its territorial gains. ""Beijing proposes practicable and constructive steps to achieve peace by refraining from pursuing vested interests and constant escalation of tensions, minimizing the negative impact of the conflict on the global economy,"" he had said. Putin said a Chinese proposal in 2023, which Ukraine and the West rejected, could ""lay the groundwork for a political and diplomatic process that would take into account Russia's security concerns and contribute to achieving a long-term and sustainable peace."" The Kremlin said in a statement that during their talks this week, Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will ""have a detailed discussion on the entire range of issues related to the comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation and determine the new directions for further development of cooperation between Russia and China and also have a detailed exchange of opinions on the most acute international and regional issues."" The visit furthers the effort by China and Russia to topple the U.S.-led Western democratic order in favor of a more authoritarian model that crushes political opposition, human rights and freedom of speech. Putin began a fifth term in office this month. Speaking Tuesday in the upper house of Russian parliament, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow and Beijing are ""objectively interested in maintaining our lead in efforts to establish a more fair and democratic world order."" ""Russia and China aren't alone in their efforts to reform an international system and help establish a multipolar global order,"" he said. Lavrov noted that the ""duet of Moscow and Beijing plays a major balancing role in global affairs,"" adding that ""the Russian president's forthcoming visit to (China) will strengthen our joint work."" Moscow has forged increasingly close ties with Beijing as the war has dragged into a third year, diverting the bulk of its energy exports to China and relying on Chinese companies for importing high-tech components for Russian military industries to circumvent Western sanctions. The Russia-China military ties have also strengthened. They have held a series of joint war games in recent years, including naval drills and patrols by long-range bombers over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. Russian and Chinese ground forces also have deployed to the other country's territory for joint drills. China remains a major market for Russian military, while also massively expanding its domestic defensive industries, including building aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines. Putin has previously said that Russia has been sharing highly sensitive military technologies with China that helped significantly bolster its defense capability. In October 2019, he mentioned that Russia was helping China to develop an early warning system to spot ballistic missile launches - a system involving ground-based radar and satellites that only Russia and the U.S. possessed.","russian, the, chinese, military, ukraine, russia, drills, lavrov, sea, putin, xinhua, sergey, kremlin, its, industries, negotiations, president, visit, invasion, aircraft"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/russia-declares-a-72-hour-ceasefire-in-ukraine-for-next-week-to-mark-victory-day-in-world-war-ii,Russia declares a 72-hour ceasefire in Ukraine for next week to mark Victory Day in World War II,Associated Press,2025-04-28 22:32:27,"KYIV, APRIL 28 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday declared a unilateral 72-hour ceasefire next week in Ukraine to mark Victory Day in World War II as the U.S. presses for a deal to end the 3-year-old war. Kyiv insisted on a longer and immediate truce. The Kremlin said the truce, ordered on ""humanitarian grounds,"" will run from the start of May 8 and last through the end of May 10 to mark Moscow's defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 - Russia's biggest secular holiday. That timing translates to start at 2100 GMT, or 5 p.m. EDT, on May 7, lasting until 2100 GMT, or 5 p.m. EDT on May 10. Ukraine, which has previously agreed to U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal of a full 30-day ceasefire, dismissed Putin's move as window dressing. ""If Russia truly wants peace, it must cease fire immediately,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said, according to the ministry. He emphasized that Kyiv is ready for a ""lasting, reliable, and complete ceasefire"" for at least 30 full days. ""Why wait for May 8? If we can cease fire now from any date and for 30 days - so that it is real, and not just for a parade,"" he said without specifying whether Ukraine would be ready to accept the Moscow-proposed truce. The Kremlin had urged Ukraine to follow suit. ""Russia believes that the Ukrainian side should follow this example,"" it said, warning that ""in case of violations of the ceasefire by the Ukrainian side, the Russian armed forces will give an adequate and efficient response."" Putin previously announced a unilateral 30-hour Easter ceasefire and Ukraine voiced readiness to reciprocate any genuine truce at the time, but it said Russian attacks continued. Moscow, in turn, accused Ukraine of failing to halt its attacks. Russia and Ukraine had also earlier pledged to observe a 30-day halt on strikes on energy infrastructure that was brokered by the Trump administration, but they repeatedly accused each other of massive violations until the measure expired. The truce attempts underlined the massive challenges for monitoring any possible halt to hostilities along the more than 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) line of contact. Up until now, Putin had refused to accept a complete unconditional ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies to Ukraine and Ukraine's mobilization effort. The Kremlin reaffirmed that ""the Russian side again declares its readiness for peace talks without preconditions aimed at removing the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis and constructive cooperation with international partners."" Just before the ceasefire announcement, Ukraine and Russia targeted each other with long-range strikes. Russia's drone attack early Monday damaged an infrastructure facility in Cherkasy, central Ukraine, disrupting gas supplies to households in the city, Mayor Anatolii Bondarenko said. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces downed 119 Ukrainian drones overnight, most of them over Russia's Bryansk border region. In Ukraine, air raid sirens rang out across the country Monday morning. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Rubio says this week is 'very critical' The outcome of a push by Trump's administration to swiftly end the fighting, which has cost tens of thousands of lives, remains unclear, clouded by conflicting claims and doubts about how far each side might be willing to compromise amid deep hostility and mistrust. The clock is ticking on Washington's engagement in efforts to resolve Europe's biggest conflict since World War II. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that this week would be ""very critical."" The U.S. needs to ""make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" American military aid has been crucial for Ukraine's war effort, and further help could be at risk if the Trump administration walks away from attempts to end the war. Trump's doubts about Putin's intentions Trump said over the weekend he harbors doubts about Putin's sincerity in pursuing a deal, as Russian forces have continued to strike civilian areas of Ukraine with cruise and ballistic missiles while the talks have proceeded. But on Friday, Trump described a brokered settlement on the war as ""close."" Western European officials have accused the Kremlin of dragging its feet on peace talks so that Russia's larger forces, which have battlefield momentum, can seize more Ukrainian land. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed the war in a phone call Sunday with Rubio, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. They focused on ""consolidating the emerging prerequisites for starting negotiations,"" the statement said, without elaborating. Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting by imposing far-reaching conditions. Ukraine has accepted it, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says. A French diplomatic official said over the weekend that Trump, Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed ""to pursue in the coming days the work of convergence"" to obtain ""a solid ceasefire."" The diplomat said a truce is a ""prior condition for a peace negotiation that respects the interest of Ukraine and the Europeans."" The official was not authorized to be publicly identified in accordance with French presidential policy. Ukraine unwilling to give up land Ukraine, meanwhile, has balked at surrendering land to Russia in return for peace, which Washington has indicated could be necessary. A key point of leverage for Ukraine could be a deal with Washington that grants access to Ukraine's critical mineral wealth. Ukraine and the U.S. have made progress on a mineral agreement, with both sides agreeing that American aid provided so far to Kyiv will not be taken into account under the terms of the deal, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Sunday. ""We have good progress,"" he said after talks with U.S. Treasury Under Secretary Scott Bessent in Washington. ""The main thing is that we clearly defined our red lines: The agreement must comply with Ukraine's Constitution, legislation, and European commitments, and must be ratified by Parliament,"" Shmyhal said. Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022 has developed a significant international dimension, further complicating negotiations. Putin on Monday thanked North Korea for sending what the U.S. estimates are thousands of troops to help defeat Ukraine, as well as allegedly supplying artillery ammunition. Iran has also helped Russia in the war, with Shahed drones, and China has sold Russia machinery and microelectronics that Moscow can use to make weapons, Western officials say. The U.S. and Europe have been Kyiv's biggest backers.","ceasefire, the, truce, russian, ukrainian, ukraine, 30, halt, trump, russia, putin, war, may, hour, bondarenko, bessent, sybiha, anatolii, western, forces"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/ukraine-will-send-a-team-to-the-us-next-week-for-talks-on-a-new-draft-mineral-deal,Ukraine will send a team to the US next week for talks on a new draft mineral deal,Associated Press,2025-04-06 22:25:58,"KYIV, APRIL 6 Ukraine will send a team to Washington next week to begin negotiations on a new draft of a deal that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine's valuable mineral resources, Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko told The Associated Press. ""The new draft agreement from the U.S. shows that the intention to create a fund or jointly invest remains,"" Svyrydenko said Saturday, during a trip to northern Ukraine. The delegation from Kyiv will include representatives from the Ministries of Economy, Foreign Affairs, Justice and Finance. The long-running negotiations over a mineral deal have already strained relations between Kyiv and Washington. The two sides had been preparing in February to sign a framework agreement but the plan was derailed following a contentious meeting in the Oval Office between U.S. President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. After some Ukrainian lawmakers leaked the new draft, critics slammed it as little more than an attempt to strip Kyiv of control over its own natural resources and infrastructure. According to the leaked document, the new draft includes not only rare-earth minerals but gas and oil. Ukraine holds significant deposits of more than 20 minerals deemed strategically critical by the U.S., including titanium, which is used to make aircraft wings, lithium, key to several battery technologies, and uranium, used in nuclear power. New draft only gives the U.S. side of the deal Despite the disruption following the Oval Office meeting, Ukrainian officials showed interest in signing the framework deal at any time, seeing it as an important step to win the favor of President Donald Trump and shore up U.S. backing in the war against Russia's full-scale invasion. After weeks of silence on the status of the deal, the U.S. sent a new draft to Kyiv, which goes further than the original framework. It's unclear why the U.S. chose to bypass the signing of the framework deal and instead moved forward with a more comprehensive draft agreement, which would likely require ratification by Ukraine's parliament. However, Ukrainian officials have been cautious about commenting on the contents of the draft, stressing that it currently reflects only one side's position. ""What we have now is a document that reflects the position of the U.S. Treasury legal team,"" said Svyrydenko. ""This is not a final version, it's not a joint position."" She said that Ukraine's task now is to assemble a technical team for negotiations, define its red lines and core principles, and send a delegation to Washington for technical talks as early as next week. ""It's clear that the full parameters of this agreement can't be discussed online,"" Svyrydenko said. ""We need to sit down with the teams and continue the conversation in person."" Legal, investment, and financial advisers are being selected, she said. ""This marks a new stage in relations with the United States - one that requires expertise across multiple areas,"" she said. ""Ultimately, everything will be decided through the course of negotiations."" Ukraine seeks terms acceptable to both sides Svyrydenko declined to elaborate publicly on Ukraine's official evaluation of the new draft, but noted that there is now a more detailed document outlining the fund's creation. And while the initial draft focused primarily on the intention to establish the fund, Svyrydenko said the latest version lays out how American advisers envision its structure and operation. It remains unclear what role Ukraine would play in managing the fund under the newly proposed U.S. draft. However, analysts who reviewed the leaked document said Kyiv's involvement would likely be minimal - a point Ukraine hopes to challenge in upcoming negotiations, using the previously agreed framework as its reference. A previous version of the framework agreement, obtained by The Associated Press, outlined plans for a jointly owned and managed investment fund between the United States and Ukraine, intended to support the reconstruction of Ukraine's war-torn economy. Under the terms, Ukraine would allocate 50% of future revenues generated from key national assets - including minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas, and other extractable resources - to the fund. The framework agreement, which was never signed, stated that revenues from its natural resources would go into the fund and be used for the reconstruction of the country, not that ownership or control of those resources would be transferred to the United States. ""We're very focused on ensuring that the final draft of the agreement, after negotiations, fully aligns with our strategic interests,"" Svyrydenko said. ""I believe the work on the previous memorandum showed that both teams are capable of reaching these goals and agreeing on terms acceptable to both sides.""","draft, the, agreement, framework, ukraine, deal, mineral, resources, document, fund, svyrydenko, yuliia, economy, oval, advisers, ukrainian, version, treasury, vance, donald"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/worlds-largest-deforestation-project-fells-forests-for-bioethanol-fuel-sugar-and-rice-in-indonesia,"World's largest deforestation project fells forests for bioethanol fuel, sugar and rice in Indonesia",Associated Press,2025-04-07 12:35:48,"JAKARTA, APRIL 7 Indonesia plans to clear forests about the size of Belgium to produce sugarcane-derived bioethanol, rice and other food crops, potentially displacing Indigenous groups who rely on the land to survive. Local communities say they're already experiencing harm from the government-backed project, which environmental watchdogs say is the largest current planned deforestation operation in the world. A vast tropical archipelago stretching across the equator, Indonesia is home to the world's third-largest rainforest, home to many endangered species of wildlife and plants, including orangutans, elephants and giant forest flowers. Some live nowhere else. Indonesia has been building food estates, massive plantations designed to improve the country's food security for decades, with varying level of success. The concept was revived by former President Joko Widodo during his 2014- 2024 administration. The current president, Prabowo Subianto, has expanded such projects to include crops to produce bioethanol, a renewable fuel made from plants like sugar cane or corn, in pursuit of Indonesia's ambition to improve its energy mix and develop more renewable sources. ""I am confident that within four to five years at the latest, we will achieve food self-sufficiency,"" Prabowo said in October 2024. ""We must be self-sufficient in energy and we have the capacity to achieve this."" Biofuels, such as bioethanol, play an important role in decarbonizing transport by providing a low-carbon solution for sectors that heavily rely on fossil fuels such as trucking, shipping and aviation, according to the International Energy Agency. But the agency also cautions expansion of biofuel should have minimal impact on land-use, food and other environmental factors in order to be developed sustainably. That's of particular concern in Indonesia, where more than 74 million hectares (285,715 square miles) of Indonesian rainforest - an area twice the size of Germany - have been logged, burned or degraded for development of palm oil, paper and rubber plantations, nickel mining and other commodities since 1950, according to Global Forest Watch. Indonesia has vast potential for bioethanol production due to its extensive agricultural land but currently lacks sustainable feedstocks, like sugarcane and cassava. A previous attempt to introduce bioethanol-blended fuel in 2007 was discontinued a few years later due to a lack of feedstock supply. Since then, the government has accelerated work on its food and energy estate mega-project, which spans 4.3 million hectares (about 10.6 million acres) on the islands of Papua and Kalimantan. Experts say the combined size of the numerous project sites makes the mega-project the largest current deforestation project in the world. The largest site, called the Merauke Integrated Food and Energy Estate, will cover more than 3 million hectares (7.4 million acres) in the far-eastern region of Papua, according to the international environmental organization Mighty Earth. Overlapping with the Trans-Fly ecoregion, it's home to critically endangered and endemic mammals, birds and turtles and to several Indigenous groups who rely on traditional ways of living. ""Imagine every piece of vegetation in that area being completely cleared ... having all the trees and the wildlife erased from the landscape and replaced with a monoculture,"" said Glenn Horowitz, CEO of Mighty Earth. ""It's creating a zone of death in one of the most vibrant spots on Earth."" An unpublished government feasibility assessment obtained and reviewed by The Associated Press estimates that carbon dioxide emissions from clearing land for the project will total 315 million tons of C02 equivalent. An independent assessment by the Indonesia-based think tank Center of Economic and Law Studies estimated double that. Deforestation contributes to erosion, damages biodiverse areas, threatens wildlife and humans who rely on the forest and intensifies disasters from extreme weather. Hashim Djojohadikusumo, Subianto's brother and envoy for energy and the environment, said the government will reforest 6.5 million hectares (16 million acres) of degraded and deforested land. ""Thus, the food estate program continues while we mitigate the possible negative impacts with new programs, one of which is reforestation,"" he said. But experts warn that reforestation, while essential, cannot match the ecological benefits of old-growth ecosystems, which store vast amounts of carbon in their soils and biomass, regulate water cycles and support biodiversity. Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture, which oversees the food and energy estate project, did not respond to requests for comment from The AP. Merauke Sugar Group and Jhonlin Group, the two main Indonesian companies in charge of the project in Merauke, did not respond to requests for comment from The AP. Local communities in Papua that rely on the area for hunting, fishing and other aspects of their cultural identity say their basic needs have been harmed by the projects. Vincen Kwipalo, 63, a villager living in the area, said that land he and other villagers used for hunting was turned into sugarcane nurseries guarded by groups of men, preventing them from engaging in their usual ways of surviving. ""We know the forests of Papua are one of the biggest lungs of the world, yet we are destroying it,"" Kwipalo said. ""Indonesia should be proud to protect Papua ... not destroy it."" Environmental watch groups say the projects' development will impact generations of Indigenous groups for generations to come ""Where are they going to hunt, fish and live?"" said Horowitz. ""For an Indigenous community that's relied on the rainforest to provide for centuries, are they supposed to live in a sugar plantation?""","the, food, bioethanol, estate, acres, million, indonesia, energy, hectares, sugar, rainforest, land, deforestation, project, watch, size, widodo, indonesian, joko, subianto"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/what-we-know-about-the-fire-that-brought-londons-heathrow-airport-to-a-standstill,What we know about the fire that brought London's Heathrow Airport to a standstill,Associated Press,2025-03-23 22:04:04,"LONDON, MARCH 23 Heathrow Airport was up and running Saturday and airlines worked to clear the backlog after a fire at a nearby electricity substation knocked out power to Europe's busiest airport, disrupting travel plans for hundreds of thousands of people around the world. The airport said it had made space for extra flights, but it is expected to take days to get stranded passengers to their destinations and displaced aircraft into the proper locations. Here's a look at what happened and its impact on air travel. What happened? A fire at an electrical substation in west London, about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from the airport, cut power to Heathrow Airport late on Thursday. Residents reported an explosion and a fireball just before midnight. The London Fire Brigade said a transformer holding 25,000 liters (5,000 gallons) of cooling oil caught fire. It said 10 fire engines and 70 firefighters brought the blaze under control after seven hours, but isolated hotspots were still alight 24 hours after the fire started. National Grid, which maintains energy infrastructure in Britain, said the blaze damaged equipment at the substation and cut power to 67,000 properties, including Heathrow. It said power was restored to all of them by Saturday morning. The ""significant power outage"" initially forced Heathrow officials to announce that the airport would be closed until 11:59 p.m. on Friday, but some flights began to resume on Friday evening. What caused the fire? Officials said there was no suggestion of foul play, but the cause is still under investigation. The fire brigade said its investigation would focus on the electrical distribution equipment at the substation. Even so, London's Metropolitan Police Service said counterterrorism detectives were leading the investigation because of the fire's impact on critical national infrastructure. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was ""an unprecedented event."" ""Obviously, with any incident like this we will want to understand why it happened and what if any lessons it has for our infrastructure,"" he told Sky News. How was Heathrow affected? The closure disrupted the travel plans of around 200,000 people who were expected to travel through Heathrow on Friday. Heathrow advised passengers not to travel to the airport and to contact their airlines to rebook flights. With all takeoffs and landings canceled, the first impact was on dozens of long-haul flights from North America and Asia that were in the air when the airport was shut down. Some were forced to turn around, while others were diverted to airports around the United Kingdom and Europe. Heathrow-bound aircraft landed at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam; Shannon Airport in western Ireland; Glasgow, Scotland; Manchester, England; Charles de Gaulle in Paris; Lyon, France; and Frankfurt, Germany, among others. About 4,000 tons of cargo were also stranded by the closure, according to Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and leadership consultant. How long will the disruptions last? The disruptions are expected to last for days as airlines move stranded aircraft and flight crews back into position and work to accommodate passengers whose flights were canceled. Mendiratta estimated that it would take two to four days to clear all the backlogs. ""This is an extreme situation where the entire aviation ecosystem is impacted,"" she said. ""There will be two things that will be happening as a priority No. 1. First is airport operations and understanding, from an electrical system point of view, what has been impacted, if anything,"" she said. ""Did anything short out, for instance? What needs to be reactivated? And then how do you literally turn the airport back on again?"" How big is Heathrow? Heathrow was Europe's busiest airport last year, with 83.6 million passengers traveling through it. Its closure will have far-reaching impacts because it's a major hub for connecting flights to cities throughout the U.K. and around the world, as well as for travel to London. Does London have other airports? Yes. Five other air hubs in southeastern England identify themselves as London airports, but they are much smaller than Heathrow. London Gatwick, Britain's second-biggest airport, handled 43.2 million passengers last year. It's located in the town of Crawley, 28 miles (45 kilometers) south of London. What's the bigger picture? The fire raises concerns about the U.K.'s ability to withstand attacks or natural disasters that damage critical infrastructure such as communications and power networks, analysts said. The incident is particularly worrisome given recent comments by Britain's security services that Russia is conducting a reckless campaign of sabotage across Europe, said Alan Mendoza, the executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, a London-based security think tank. ""The U.K.'s critical national infrastructure is not sufficiently hardened for anywhere near the level it would need to be at to give us confidence this won't happen again,"" he said. ""I mean, if one fire can shut down Heathrow's primary systems ... it tells you something's badly wrong with our system of management of such disasters."" Robin Potter, an expert on resilience at London-based think tank Chatham House, said that successive governments have been slow to respond to repeated recommendations from the National Infrastructure Commission to strengthen the ability of Britain's power, communications, transport and water networks to withstand major shocks. ""We still have yet to see a kind of clear response from the government to those recommendations,"" he said. ""And we hope that maybe in the government's upcoming resilience review, which we expect will be published at some point this year, it might seek to address some of those questions."" Heathrow defended its response. Its CEO Thomas Woldbye said ""the same would happen in other airports"" faced with a similar fire.","fire, london, airport, heathrow, the, infrastructure, substation, flights, brigade, closure, britain, 000, woldbye, miliband, electrical, aircraft, chatham, passengers, travel, airports"

FEBRUARY 27 Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman, his wife and their dog were found dead in their New Mexico home, authorities said Thursday. Foul play was not suspected, but authorities did not release circumstances of their deaths and said an investigation was ongoing. Hackman, 95, was found dead with his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog when deputies preformed a welfare check at the home around 1:45 p.m., Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Denise Avila said. The gruff-but-beloved Hackman was among the finest actors of his generation, appearing as both villains, heroes and antiheroes in dozens of dramas, comedies and action films from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s. He was a five-time Oscar nominee who won for ""The French Connection"" and ""Unforgiven"" 21 years apart. His death comes just four days before this year's ceremony. The couple's home is in a gated community just outside New Mexico's capital city. Hackman moved to the area in the 1980s, where he was often seen around town and served as a board member of the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in the 1990s, according to the local paper, The New Mexican. Aside from appearances at awards shows, he was rarely seen in the Hollywood social circuit and retired about 20 years ago. His was the rare Hollywood retirement that actually lasted. In his later years, he wrote novels from the hilltop ranch that provided a view of the Rocky Mountains. An email sent to his publicist was not immediately returned early Thursday.","hackman, santa, gene, mexico, oscar, avila, denise, fe, sheriff, the, retirement, hollywood, his, county, actor, new, villains, hilltop, ranch, keeffe"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/russias-putin-and-chinas-xi-discuss-their-close-ties-in-chat-after-trumps-inauguration,Russia's Putin and China's Xi discuss their close ties in chat after Trump's inauguration,Associated Press,2025-01-21 20:51:07,"MOSCOW, JANUARY 21 Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping and emphasized their close ties a day after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th U.S. president. The two leaders discussed their prospective contacts with Trump's administration during the video call that lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, the Kremlin said. They have developed strong, personal links that brought their relations even closer after Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. China has become a major customer for Russian oil and gas and a source of key technologies amid sweeping Western sanctions on Moscow. In the call with Xi, Putin emphasized that Russia-China relations are based on shared interests, equality and mutual benefits, noting they ""don't depend on internal political factors and the current international environment."" ""We jointly support the development of a more just, multipolar global order, and work to ensure indivisible security in Eurasia and the world as a whole,"" Putin told Xi in remarks carried by Russian state TV. ""Joint efforts by Russia and China play an important stabilizing role in global affairs."" Xi similarly praised their close cooperation, expressing his readiness to work together with Putin to ""lead China-Russia relations to a higher level, to cope with the uncertainty of the external environment with the stability and resilience of China-Russia relations,"" and to ""safeguard international fairness and justice."" He emphasized that Russia and China should ""continue to deepen strategic cooperation, firmly support each other, and safeguard the legitimate interests of the two countries."" While neither leader directly mentioned Trump in the televised fragment of their call, the Kremlin said they touched upon prospective contacts with the new U.S. administration. The Chinese president spoke by phone Friday with Trump and expressed hope for positive ties with the U.S. Trump had threatened to impose tariffs and other measures against China in his second term, while also hinting at ways in which the two rival powers could cooperate on issues such as regional conflicts and curbing the export of substances used in the production of fentanyl. Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters the Putin-Xi call had been planned in advance and wasn't specifically linked to Trump's inauguration. But he noted that Xi briefed Putin about it. Putin and Xi discussed ""certain issues related to possible contacts with the U.S. administration,"" Ushakov added Putin and Xi expressed readiness to develop ties with Washington on the basis of mutual benefit and respect if Trump's team shows interest in that, he said. Putin, who has yet to talk to Trump, congratulated him on taking office in televised remarks during a video call with officials and welcomed his intention to open a dialogue with Moscow. Trump told reporters Monday after taking office that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had told him he wanted to make a peace deal and voiced hope that Putin would follow suit. He added that Putin would be destroying Russia by failing to make a deal, pointing out Russia's economic troubles, including high inflation. Ushakov dodged commenting on Trump's statement, saying the Kremlin is waiting for ""concrete proposals that could form the basis for contacts."" ""We are open and ready for serious dialogue with the new U.S. administration on the Ukrainian conflict, and if relevant signals come from Washington, we would pick them up and stand ready to conduct talks,"" he said, adding that the Kremlin hasn't received any such signals yet. On Monday, Putin praised Trump's openness to dialogue as he spoke to Russia's Security Council shortly before the inauguration. ""We hear the statements from Trump and members of his team about their desire to restore direct contact with Russia, which were halted through no fault of ours by the outgoing administration,"" Putin had said. ""We also hear his statements about the need to do everything to prevent World War III. We certainly welcome such an approach and congratulate the U.S. president-elect on taking office."" He also stressed that dialogue should be based on ""equal basis and mutual respect, taking into account the important role our countries play on some key issues on the global agenda, including the strengthening of global stability and security."" Moscow is open to dialogue with the Trump administration on Ukraine, Putin said, emphasizing the need to respect Russia's interests and adding that ""the most important thing is to remove the root causes of the crisis."" ""As for the settlement of the situation, I would like to underline that its goal should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but a long-term peace based on respect for the legitimate interests of all people, all nations living in this region,"" he said.","the, trump, putin, russia, call, administration, xi, contacts, president, ushakov, yuri, signals, interests, russian, security, statements, inauguration, stability, jinping, basis"

When I visited the place in October 2024, the only word I could think of was 'breathtaking'. The Dead Sea, a landlocked salt lake bordering Jordan, Israel and the West Bank, lies 1,300 feet below sea level, making it the lowest point on Earth. The water is 9.6 times saltier than the ocean, and you can float effortlessly. Honestly, floating on the Dead Sea was scary. The ""what if"" question circled my mind. But its dense water makes sinking impossible. In Hebrew, the Dead Sea is called ""Yam Ha-Melakh"". Many visit the sea for its therapeutic benefits and wellness treatments. The Dead Sea isn't only a natural wonder; it's also a gateway to understanding ancient history and faith. Around three million years ago, a shift in the Earth's crust created a basin that became the Dead Sea. Water from the Jordan River and streams flowed in, but intense desert heat caused it to evaporate. Minerals like salt, magnesium and bromine concentrated over time. Today, this process makes the Dead Sea the saltiest water body on Earth. In the Bible's book of Genesis, God destroyed the sinful cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, warning Lot's family to flee without looking back. The Bible portrays Lot as a righteous person who did not fully participate in the sins. Lot's wife disobeyed and was turned into a pillar of salt. This story is seen as a symbolic lesson about the dangers of holding on to the past and the consequences of immorality. In 1947, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the Qumran caves became one of the greatest archaeological events of the 20th century. These scrolls, preserved for 2,000 years, offer a glimpse into ancient Jewish beliefs and life during the time of Jesus. Interestingly, the Dead Sea also connects with Nepal through a unique monument at the Ecological Park near the Dead Sea. It features two stones: one from Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth, and the other from the Dead Sea, the lowest. On May 30,2013, a ceremony was held here in which Israel's Tourism Minister Uzi Landau, Nepali Ambassador to Israel Prahlad Kumar Prasai, Mayor Dov Litvinoff, diplomats and other distinguished guests were present. Similarly, in Nepal, stones brought from the Dead Sea have been installed as a monument at the Headquarters of Sagarmatha National Park in Namche Bazaar. As a Nepali, this was such a proud moment to see. This project not only promotes international tourism but also honours the friendship between the two nations and the shared wonder of these heavenly sites.","sea, dead, the, scrolls, litvinoff, uzi, dov, landau, bible, monument, prasai, wonder, stones, water, crust, caves, prahlad, qumran, melakh, tourism"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/the-cult-of-trump-selling-the-myth-of-american-glory,The cult of Trump: Selling the myth of American glory,Sakshat Pant,2024-11-22 12:58:42,"As Donald Trump strides back into office, it's clear that the Make America Great Again (MAGA) has transformed from a slogan into a creed, a kind of civil religion for those who long for sepia-toned visions of an America that might never have existed. This revival raises a nagging question: When, exactly, was America ever truly great? Was it during the post-World War II boom, when economic prosperity skyrocketed, mostly for white Americans, while Black families were systematically sidelined by redlining? Or perhaps it was during the Vietnam War, when young Americans were sent to drop napalm on civilians, all in the name of containing a threat that never materialised, while the government concealed the true cost of the war? For MAGA devotees, however, America reached its ""greatness"" on January 6, 2021, when rioters stormed the Capitol in service of a single man: the very man who now once again holds the highest office in the land. To them, that day wasn't an attack on democracy, it was a revival, a righteous defence of an America they feel is slipping through their fingers. It is but a warped narrative that paints the violent insurrection as a noble act of rebellion rather than a direct assault on the foundations of the American republic. At its core, MAGA and Trump embody the ""us"" versus ""them"" mentality. The ""us"" can do no wrong, exempt from the rules and standards that apply to ""them."" Take, for instance, the double standard on age. Joe Biden's advanced years are relentlessly criticised by Trump supporters, with ""Sleepy Joe"" caricatured as too frail to govern. Yet Trump, who will be 82 when his second term ends, faces no such scrutiny from his base. Why? Because in the MAGA universe, truth is malleable. It's not about logic or consistency, but loyalty to the tribe. If Biden stumbles, he's senile; if Trump does, he's relatable, even charming in his vulnerability. This is the beauty of the cult of personality. MAGA thrives on the belief that America is being stolen from its true heirs. The America that was never quite theirs in the first place. It tells them the American way of life is under siege. These supposed threats conveniently include people of colour, LGBTQ+ members, women and immigrants. Essentially, anyone who stands outside the white, Christian, heteronormative ideal that MAGA cherishes. It's no surprise that the saviours of these supposed threats are often billionaires, mega-corporations, conservative elites and any other entity that thrives on the systemic inequalities inherent in the American way of life. Take for example, yet another commodification of religion. Trump intends to make school prayers and bibles mandatory in schools. But not just any bible, it has got to be the ""Trump endorsed Bible"". This isn't a matter of personal judgement; it's supported by empirical data. As outlined in his policies, Trump advocates for lowering corporate taxes and imposing tariffs, which ultimately passes the cost to the consumers. When asked about making health care more affordable, he claims to have ""a concept of a plan,"" but offers little substance beyond that. The reality is that MAGA is a mirage, an illusion of greatness that thrives on fear and division. Trump's return to power isn't a revival; it's a reckoning. It serves as a reminder of what happens when a nation falls for the oldest trick in the book: selling nostalgia to those too desperate to demand something real. Not to mention, the MAGA crowd might just have the most perfect shade of rose-tinted glasses I have ever seen. They somehow manage to overlook the fact that a man with children from three different women, a history of pending legal cases, a known sexual assaulter and a convicted felon is not only running for president but is also leading the charge for a return to ""traditional values."" Then there is the sheer commodification of patriotism, a phenomenon Trump has mastered. From MAGA branded hats to Trump-branded NFTs, the movement has turned loyalty into a marketable product. It is not just about political allegiance; it's merchandise, rally tickets and exclusive clubs where belonging comes with a price tag, turning political engagement into a transaction, where loyalty to a leader is measured by how much you can spend. In this twisted version of democracy, influence is not earned through ideas or ideals; it is bought and sold. The inevitable result is that MAGA supporters are left with little more than a hollow, overpriced trinket to mark their allegiance, a symbol of devotion that costs more than it is worth. Elon Musk's involvement in Trump's return to power takes this narrative a step beyond. By funnelling $200 million into America Pac, Musk didn't just fund a campaign; he rewrote the rules of engagement entirely. Musk's reward? A $60 billion surge in his net worth and a front-row seat in shaping a second Trump administration. For Musk, power isn't just political; it's incredibly profitable. His financial influence has blurred the line between political power and corporate interests, creating a toxic cocktail where the rich shape the fate of the nation, while the masses are left in the dust. His involvement underscores just how much democracy has been captured by the elite, where a single individual can tilt the scales of justice with a few hundred million dollars and little regard for the truth. For those who yearn for an America that truly fulfils its promises, the challenge is clear. True greatness doesn't lie in a mythical past, but in building a future that's fair, inclusive and just. But then again, the alternate choice is no saint either. The greatest country in the world, the land of freedom, yet it never quite figured out how to practise what it preaches. Caught in its own contradictions, an outsider might feel both sympathy and perhaps offer a gentle critique, which is something I've tried to do throughout this piece. sakshatofficial@gmail.com","the, maga, america, trump, musk, war, commodification, allegiance, sleepy, greatness, joe, make, revival, elon, americans, american, his, true, narrative, involvement"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/donald-trump-has-sweeping-plans-for-a-second-administration-heres-what-hes-proposed,Donald Trump has sweeping plans for a second administration. Here's what he's proposed,Associated Press,2024-11-06 20:36:00,"WASHINGTON, NOVEMBER 6 Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration. The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role. Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers. A look at what Trump has proposed: Immigration ""Build the wall!"" from his 2016 campaign has become creating ""the largest mass deportation program in history."" Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He's pitched ""ideological screening"" for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he'd reinstitute first-term policies such as ""Remain in Mexico,"" limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall. Abortion Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman's federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump's insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Still, Trump has not said explicitly that he would veto national abortion restrictions if they reached his desk. And in an example of how the conservative movement might proceed with or without Trump, anti-abortion activists note that the GOP platform still asserts that a fetus should have due process protections under the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. That constitutional argument is a roadmap for conservatives to seek a national abortion ban through federal courts. Taxes Trump's tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That's mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden's income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change. Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It's noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income - a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers. Tariffs and trade Trump's posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods - and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the Food and Drug Administration buy ""essential"" medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of ""any vital infrastructure"" in the U.S. by Chinese buyers. DEI, LGBTQ and civil rights Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage. On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end ""boys in girls' sports,"" a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration's policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth. Regulation, federal bureaucracy and presidential power The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households' utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration - even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations - though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end ""frivolous litigation from the environmental extremists."" The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House. He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government's power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain. Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers' budget actions ""set a ceiling"" on spending but not a floor - meaning the president's constitutional duty to ""faithfully execute the laws"" includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress. As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work. Education The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding ""for any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children."" In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his ""secret weapon"" against the ""Marxist Maniacs and lunatics"" he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect ""billions and billions of dollars"" from schools via ""taxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments"" at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights. As in other policy areas, Trump isn't actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online ""American Academy"" offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. ""It will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed-none of that's going to be allowed,"" Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid but his first administration, in general, defaulted to approving state requests for waivers of various federal rules and it broadly endorsed state-level work requirements for recipients. Affordable Care Act and Health Care As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the ""concepts of a plan."" In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of ""making America healthy again."" Climate and energy Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a ""hoax,"" blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy – and transportation infrastructure spending – anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. ""Drill, baby, drill!"" was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards. Workers' rights Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America's workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden's push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump ""the union bosses and CEOs"" together as complicit in ""this disastrous electric car scheme."" In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, ""I'm telling you, you shouldn't pay those dues."" National defense and America's role in the world Trump's rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield - an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia's war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: ""peace through strength."" But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. ""I don't consider them leaders,"" Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans ""see on television."" He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary's Viktor Orban and Russia's Vladimir Putin.","federal, trump, the, abortion, tax, biden, spending, taxes, workers, americans, income, protections, administration, policy, his, auto, wages, energy, drill, president"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/rioters-who-stormed-capitol-after-trumps-2020-defeat-toast-his-white-house-return,Rioters who stormed Capitol after Trump's 2020 defeat toast his White House return,Associated Press,2024-11-08 21:58:17,"WASHINGTON, NOVEMBER 8 As it became clear Donald Trump was returning to the White House, the Florida man who posed for photos with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lectern during the Capitol riot popped a bottle of Trump-branded sparkling wine. ""Y'all are in trouble,"" he said after taking a sip in a video shared on social media. Rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, are celebrating Trump's victory and hoping he makes good on his campaign trail promise to pardon them. Trump didn't mention the Jan. 6 defendants, whom he has called ""hostages"" and ""patriots,"" during his victory speech on Wednesday. But his defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris throws into doubt the future of the largest prosecution in Justice Department history over the unprecedented assault on a seat of American democracy. More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Joe Biden's 2020 victory. More than 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial of charges, including misdemeanor trespassing offenses, assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy. Trump's praise of Jan. 6 defendants was a centerpiece of his campaign, with rallies honoring them as heroes featuring a song he collaborated on with a group of jailed rioters. Trump hasn't explained how he will decide who gets pardoned. But he has suggested he would consider granting them even for those accused of assault as well as the former Proud Boys leader convicted of orchestrating a violent plot in 2020 to keep Trump in power. During his first term as president, Trump deployed his pardon power in overtly political ways, granting clemency in his final days in office to a broad range of political allies -- including five defendants convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation -- as well as celebrities, Republican members of Congress and the father of Jared Kushner, his son-in-law. Jacob Lang, a Capitol riot defendant who's jailed while awaiting a trial in Washington, posted within hours of Trump's victory that he and other Jan. 6 ""political prisoners"" were ""finally coming home."" ""There will be no bitterness in my heart as I walk out of these doors in 75 days on inauguration day,"" Lang wrote. Lawyers for some Jan. 6 defendants cited Trump's victory in requests to hold off on sentencing their clients. Defense attorney Marina Medvin said her client, Christopher Carnell, is ""expecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office."" Michelle Peterson, an assistant federal public defender, argued it would be ""fundamentally unfair"" to sentence a client whose case may be dismissed by Trump's Justice Department. Judges swiftly denied both requests and refused to delay separate hearings for their respective cases on Friday. Other defense attorneys on Wednesday asked for a Jan. 6 defendant's trial to be postponed. They argued that their client, Mitchell Bosch, cannot receive a fair trial in Washington so soon after the election given that voters in the nation's capital overwhelmingly supported Harris over Trump. ""Mr. Bosch understands that the President-elect's proclamations of stolen elections and pardons for patriots are not relevant evidence in his trial. However, they are highly relevant to the ability of the jury pool to be fair and impartial,"" the lawyers wrote. A trial is scheduled to start next week for Steve Baker, a writer charged with Capitol riot-related misdemeanors. Baker, who has written articles about the Jan. 6 riot for the conservative outlet Blaze News, posted a photo of a press credential for him to cover Congress. ""I plan on covering J6, 2025 'inside' the Capitol,"" he wrote on Wednesday, adding a winking face emoji. Of the more than 1,000 convicted rioters who have been sentenced, over 650 have received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years. Hundreds of people who went into the Capitol but did not attack police or damage the building were charged only with misdemeanors. The violence and destruction by other members of the mob have been documented in videos and other evidence heard in court, including testimony from police officers about being beaten and scared for their lives as they defended the Capitol. Trump has said he would issue pardons to Capitol rioters on ""Day 1"" of his presidency. He told Time Magazine he would consider pardoning all of the Jan. 6 defendants, though later added: ""If somebody was evil and bad, I would look at that differently."" He told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" last year that he would consider pardoning former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison after being convicted of seditious conspiracy. Trump said Tarrio was treated ""horribly."" When pressed during an event in July, Trump said he ""absolutely"" would pardon rioters accused of assaulting police - if they were ""innocent."" When the interviewer noted she was talking about convicted rioters, Trump replied that they were convicted ""by a very tough system."" Kim Wehle, a University of Baltimore law professor and author of a book about presidential pardons, said presidents have the unfettered power to issue mass pardons. ""The pardon system is set up for winners and losers. Who gets them and who doesn't get them is completely subjective. It's completely arbitrary and based on the whims of the president,"" Wehle said. ""Donald Trump could fashion the pardon however he wants to fashion the pardon, and the general public wouldn't be able to challenge it."" Presidents have used their power to issue mass pardons for the sake of promoting national unity. George Washington pardoned Whiskey Rebellion rebels. Abraham Lincoln pardoned former Confederate soldiers after the Civil War. Jimmy Carter pardoned Vietnam War draft dodgers. Many of those expressing support for Jan. 6 defendants also echoed Trump's campaign talk of seeking retribution against political foes. Julie Kelly, a right-wing political commentator who calls herself a ""J6 conspiracy theorist"" on her social media profile, posted that Washington-based U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves' ""reign of terror is going to end soon."" ""Then we turn the tables,"" Kelly wrote.","capitol, jan, riot, rioters, the, defendants, trial, trump, pardon, client, his, than, attorney, graves, mueller, whiskey, pardons, pelosi, tarrio, medvin"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/with-china-and-the-us-at-intense-economic-odds-other-nations-are-being-forced-to-choose-sides,"With China and the US at intense economic odds, other nations are being forced to choose sides",Associated Press,2025-04-28 20:41:32,"WASHINGTON, APRIL 28 One went to the United States. The other went to China. It was a sign of the times. While the Swiss president was in Washington last week to lobby U.S. officials over President Donald Trump's threatened 31% tariff on Swiss goods, the Swiss foreign minister was in Beijing, expressing his nation's willingness to strengthen cooperation with China and upgrade a free trade agreement. As Trump's trade war locks the world's two largest economies on a collision course, America's unnerved allies and partners are cozying up with China to hedge their bets. It comes as Trump's trade push upends a decade of American foreign policy - including his own from his first term - toward rallying the rest of the world to join the United States against China. And it threatens to hand Beijing more leverage in any eventual dialogue with the U.S. administration. With Trump saying that countries are ""kissing my ass"" to negotiate trade deals on his terms or risk stiff import taxes, Beijing is reaching out to countries far and near. It portrays itself as a stabilizing force and a predictable trading partner, both to cushion the impact from Trump's tariffs and to forge stronger trade ties outside of the U.S. market. ""America and China are now locked in a fierce contest for global supremacy,"" Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in an April 16 speech. ""Both powers claim they do not wish to force countries to choose sides. But in reality, each seeks to draw others closer into their respective orbits."" The tariffs on Chinese goods are off the charts Trump has paused some of his steepest tariffs on most American partners for 90 days after global financial markets melted down. But the Republican president has raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, drawing rebukes from Beijing, which has vowed to ""fight to the end."" U.S. companies are warning of higher prices, meaning Trump could face both higher inflation and empty store shelves. The magnitude of the taxes are already dramatically affecting American imports, with the shipping containers set to arrive at the Port of Los Angeles down nearly 36% over the past two weeks, according to Port Optimizer, which tracks vessels. It's lending urgency for both the U.S. and China to bolster support from alternate partners. While Trump administration officials suggest the president could ease the duty rates on Chinese goods at his discretion, there has been no indication he's yet looking for a reduction. That, after all, could suggest his protectionist policies were hurting the American economy. ""They want to make a deal obviously,"" Trump told reporters Sunday, saying the U.S. had gone ""cold turkey"" on trade from China. ""Right now, they're not doing business with us."" The White House has framed any negotiations as being between the U.S. president and Chinese President Xi Jinping, but neither leader seems willing to make the initial outreach without some kind of concession. The two countries can't even agree publicly whether they are holding talks. Earlier this month, Xi - on his first foreign trip this year - visited Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, resulting in mutual pledges for closer economic and trade ties. In Vietnam, which faces the 46% tariff from the U.S., Beijing and Hanoi agreed to strengthen industrial and supply chain cooperation. In Malaysia and Cambodia, Xi secured similar agreements. Cambodia is faced with a 49% tariff from the U.S., and Malaysia 24%. Then there's Japan: Despite its long-standing enmity towards the nation that once colonized parts of it, the Chinese government has reached out to Tokyo and urged a coordinated response, according to Kyodo News. China is digging in China is ready to use the stick, too. A South Korean newspaper has reported that China is demanding South Korean businesses not to ship goods containing China's rare earth minerals to U.S. defense companies or face likely sanctions. Earlier this month, Beijing warned that no country should reach a deal with the U.S. at China's expense and vowed to take countermeasures in a ""resolute and reciprocal manner"" should such a situation arise. Hal Brands, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said China will ""try to exploit Trump's abrasive behavior to make inroads with U.S. allies and countries in the Global South."" Some scholars say Beijing is already gaining. ""People lost the confidence, or even trust, for the United States, particularly for Donald Trump in the U.S. Not for China,"" said Li Cheng, professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong. ""So in that regard, China gains in the geopolitical landscape."" Countries have to choose, but it's difficult China is the world's largest exporter and the U.S. the largest importer. Total trade for China reached a record 43.85 trillion yuan (US$6 trillion) in 2024, and the country is the biggest trading partner for most of the world, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea and the grouping of the 10 Southeast Asian countries known as ASEAN. The U.S. is the biggest destination for China's exports, though China is only the third-largest trading partner with the U.S., behind Mexico and Canada. Total trade for the U.S. last year was US$5.4 billion, with a record deficit of $1.2 trillion. For ASEAN countries, trade with the U.S. totaled $477 billion in 2024, including $352 billion worth of goods sold to the U.S. But China does more business with ASEAN. Countries caught between the U.S. and China are in ""an impossible situation"" because they need to stay economically connected both to China, ""a source of a lot of their input and imports"" and to the powerhouse U.S. market, said Matthew Goodman, director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""They cannot choose one or the other, because they need both,"" Goodman said. In Europe, China is preparing to lift sanctions to revive a trade deal, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. Chinese state media have been calling on European leaders to join China in safeguarding the multilateralism. Back in Beijing, Xi has been receiving foreign leaders. On Thursday, he told Kenya's president that China's market has always kept its door open to high-quality products from Kenya and that China encourages more capable Chinese enterprises to invest and start businesses in Kenya, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. On Wednesday, Xi met Azerbaijan's president. Xi criticized the trade war as undermining the rights and interests of all countries. Beijing sounds resolute On Friday, when Xi presided over a key economic meeting, Beijing's leadership struck a positive tone but acknowledged ""increasing impact from external shocks"" and ""urged preparing for worst-case scenarios with sufficient planning,"" according to Xinhua. Wang Yiwei, a senior fellow at Beijing's Center for China and Globalization, said China, after dealing with Trump's first term, is prepared for his latest tariff approach. ""China is prepared for the worst,"" Wang said, ""and it is no longer living in the fantasy of globalization."" Victor Gao, vice president of the Center for China and Globalization, said Beijing is prepared for decoupling. ""What will be the end? It's a complete halt, meaning no more U.S exports to China, no more China exports to the United States,"" he said. And, despite high costs to China's economy, China will survive, Gao said. ""For a country especially like China with a history of 5,000 years, what kind of people have we not seen? Whatever invaders, robbers, and barbarians,"" Gao said. ""But at the end, they all leave. They all disappear, all get defeated.""","the, trump, trade, china, president, tariff, center, south, chinese, swiss, american, foreign, tariffs, port, yuan, exports, hong, kong, countries, geoeconomic"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/the-bankariya-community-and-the-forest-carbon-partnership-facility,The Bankariya community: And the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility,"Indira Kumari Shreesh, Simone Galimberti",2025-04-11 09:38:37,"In 2021, the World Bank announced a groundbreaking new financial commitment to help Nepal promote afforestation practices and the overall protection of forests across the country. Based on the agreement, the government was set to receive $45 million under the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF). The FCPF is a financial vehicle to implement the so-called REDD+ framework, a global mechanism of ""reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries"" while, in addition, ensuring the sustainable management and conservation of forests. In lay terms, a recipient nation in a developing nation, if it proves to protect its forest, becomes eligible to get ""results-based payments"". The truth, however, is that carbon credits in general are extremely complex mechanisms with plenty of technicalities and with hard-to-understand details. We are talking of what is called ""avoidance carbon credits"" that in practice reward local communities for not destroying their forests and, therefore, help to avoid the emission of carbon dioxide. In 2023, a study published in Science and widely disseminated by Mongabay and the Guardian, among others, questioned the efficacy of REDD+ carbon credits.""Action needed to make carbon offsets from forest conservation work for climate change mitigation"" was the revealing title of the article accompanying the research. ""Researchers found that about 94% of the credits from the projects they looked at don't represent real reductions in carbon emissions"" explained a story on Mongabay about the research. Moreover, beyond the legitimate doubts and concerns about the impact of REDD + carbon credits, it is also paramount to ask two other paramount questions. Even if some real benefits would be accrued from these schemes, are indigenous peoples, guardians of many national ecosystems, in a position to benefit from them? The web page describing the potential impact of FCPF in Nepal explains that ""the program's interventions include improving the management practices on existing community forests building on traditional and customary practices; localizing forest governance through the transfer of national forests to community and collaborative forest user groups; scaling up pro-poor leasehold forestry; improving integrated land use planning to reduce forest conversion associated with advancing infrastructure development; and strengthening the management of protected areas"", among others. But are indigenous people fully involved and engaged in the implementation of these projects? The experience of one of the most vulnerable indigenous nationalities of the country, the Bankariya, is proving that, on the matter of Indigenous Peoples-led conservation and roll out of forests-related carbon credits, there is still an extremely long way to go. As one of the most endangered indigenous peoples, the Bankariya massively suffered the consequences of the creation of the Parsa National Park, which caused their forced eviction from their ancestral land. With 180 members, the whole survival of the Bankariya might soon be in jeopardy. Till now, the Bankariya live on leased land on the buffer zone alongside the park.The whole area is part of the Tarai Arc Landscape (TAL), a transboundary zone that should, at least in theory, benefit from the REDD+ funding channeled through FCPF. Their situation is a model template of marginalisation and exclusion linked to the implementation of carbon credit mechanisms experienced by indigenous peoples not only in Nepal but also in many other nations in the Global South. In a context like Nepal, there is an urgent need for REDD+-related schemes, including financial disbursement mechanisms like FCPF, to become much more inclusive and be truly used to empower indigenous nationalities like the Bankariya. We should not forget that on April 27, 2015, the Supreme Court, acting on a public interest litigation filed by CEMSOJ, a not-for-profit defending the rights of indigenous peoples in Nepal, had ordered the government to ensure that any action to conserve the environment, to sell, trade or consume forest products, including carbon, should also be consistent with and comply with the international legal commitments, including the Paris Agreement, taken by the country. In a recent public event held in Kathmandu, a member of the community, Ram Bankariya, expressed his dismay about how his community had been deceived by state policies that, while designed to protect parks, have proved to severely impact the whole Bankariya community. ""We live in the forest or nearby forest, however, the policies that the government makes are never consulted with us. Due to the current policies, we cannot take anything from the forest, we are sent to jail and criminalised,"" he shared. ""Even though the government protects wild animals, humans near the forest don't even get the basic human rights ensured."" Bankariya concluded his intervention with a strong statement, ""Our forests aren't for carbon trade; they are our life resources."" This is the sober reality about a tool that is supposed to protect forests and benefit their ancestral guardians. The survival of the whole Bankariya community is now even more at risk because the lease on the land they are currently inhabiting, that has been in place for 20 years, will soon expire in Baisakh 2082, or April 14. Can mechanisms like FCPF be reformed not only to be more impactful to reduce carbon emissions but truly become platforms to enable local indigenous peoples, especially their female members, to benefit from the financial windfall? Yet, the only way to start finding an answer to it is to ensure that the whole governance framework of FCPF is reformed, making it more decentralised and truly designed to genuinely engage and involve indigenous peoples like the Bankariya.

The funding aims to enhance the resilience of bridges in the Strategic Road Network, ensuring safer and uninterrupted connectivity across Nepal's dviverse and challenging terrain. Nepal's bridge infrastructure plays a crucial role in connecting remote and urban communities to essential services, including healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. However, frequent climate-induced disasters, such as floods, landslides, and earthquakes, pose significant threats to these structures. The program, led by Department of Roads, will focus on climate-resilient measures such as enhanced structural designs and real-time monitoring systems to protect bridges from extreme weather events. Additionally, bridge designs will prioritize accessibility, ensuring better connectivity for marginalized communities. According to a World Bank press release, the initiative will also include capacity-building programs for the Department of Roads, promoting innovative solutions and strengthening institutional systems for effective infrastructure management. David Sislen, the World Bank's Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, emphasized the importance of resilient infrastructure development in ensuring safe and sustained connectivity. He highlighted that the program would support access to markets and essential services for vulnerable communities, contributing to Nepal's sustainable growth.

Every year, social media is flooded with their photos of acceptance letters in hand, smiles as wide as their dreams and aspirations. At first, it's exciting to watch. I cheer them on, inspired by their success and determination. But the more I see it, the more it makes me wonder: why do so many of our brightest students leave Nepal? It feels strange, doesn't it? A country like ours, so rich in culture, beauty and community, somehow doesn't feel like enough for many of us when it comes to opportunities. I started thinking about this more deeply because I'll soon be at that crossroads myself. Should I stay or should I leave, just like them? Why do students want to leave? Talking to my seniors, I hear the same reasons again and again. The first one is education. Sure, Nepal has schools and colleges, but let's be honest-most of us don't believe they can compete with what's out there in the United States, Canada or Australia. I've heard most of my seniors talk about how jobs here don't pay any good. They argue, ""Why would a rational person stay in Nepal earning Rs. 25,000 a month when you could make ten times that somewhere else?"" For them, leaving feels like the smart, obvious choice. What happens to Nepal when they leave? When I think about the students who leave, I feel bittersweet. On one hand, they are going for a better future and that's great for them. On the other hand, Nepal loses something every time a talented student leaves the nation. Brain drain will inevitably spell doom for Nepal. Our healthcare, technology and innovation will lack skilled manpower for steady development. Who will solve our problems if the people who can make a difference aren't here? Who will bring fresh ideas to our hospitals, tech companies, or government offices if everyone's working in Silicon Valley or Toronto? It's not just a loss of people-it's a loss of potential. It's strange to think about all this while still in school, but it feels personal. I want to believe that I don't have to leave to chase my dreams. I want to live in a Nepal where staying feels just as exciting as going abroad. When my seniors leave, I cheer them on because I know they're doing what's best for them. But deep down, I hope that one day, the story will be different. I hope that instead of watching everyone pack their bags, we'll start unpacking the potential of our own country.

Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts. ""This bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,"" Rowland told Parliament. ""There is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,"" she added. The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction. ""For too many young Australians, social media can be harmful. Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits,"" Rowland said. Government research found that ""95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their toughest parenting challenges,"" she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she said. ""This is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we're in their corner when it comes to supporting their children's health and wellbeing,"" Rowland said. Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks. Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users. ""We are not saying risks don't exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,"" Rowland said. The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages. In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said. Age Check Certification Scheme's chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age. Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes. Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said. Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for ""meaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation."" ""Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,"" DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. ""A blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it,"" Bose added.","age, online, ban, bose, platforms, inference, australians, bill, digital, sunita, industry, technologies, the, young, content, melbourne, social, curation, olds, givers"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/indias-ban-on-salman-rushdie-the-satanic-verses-may-end-thanks-to-missing-paperwork,India's ban on Salman Rushdie 'The Satanic Verses' may end - thanks to missing paperwork,,2024-11-10 11:36:09,"NEW DELHI, NOVEMBER 9 The decades long ban of Salman Rushdie's ""The Satanic Verses"" in his native India is now in doubt - not because of a change of heart more than two years after the author's near-fatal stabbing, but because of what amounts to some missing paperwork. Earlier this week, a court in New Delhi closed proceedings on a petition filed five years ago that challenged the then-government's decision to ban the import of the novel, which enraged Muslims worldwide because of its alleged blasphemy, just days after its 1988 publication. In a ruling issued Tuesday, according to the Press Trust of India news agency, a bench headed by Justice Rekha Palli said authorities had failed to produce the notification of the ban. ""We have no other option except to presume that no such notification exists,"" the judges concluded. The petitioner, Sandipan Khan, had argued that he couldn't buy the book because of a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on Oct. 5, 1988, which forbade its import into India, adding that he was unable to locate the notification on any official website or through officials. Khan's lawyer, Uddyam Mukherjee, said that the court's ruling meant that as of now, nothing prohibits anybody from importing the novel into India. ""But whether this means it will be sold in bookstores - I don't know, that depends on the publishers or sellers,"" he told The Associated Press. When reached by phone, several bookstores in the country's capital were unaware of the news. An employee of Jain Book Agency in New Delhi said that they did not know whether this news meant that the novel would be available again in stores in India, adding that if that was the case, it could still take time and that they would need to hear from the publisher. ""What the ruling does is open up a potential path for the book to become available here,"" Mukherjee said, but added that any aggrieved individual, group or the government can also appeal against it. Rushdie's literary agent, Andrew Wylie, declined comment to the AP. Rushdie, now a citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States, has yet to comment publicly. He has more than 1 million followers on his X account, on which he last posted in September. Rushdie's publisher in India, Penguin Random House India, issued a statement Friday called the ruling a ""significant new development"" and adding that it was ""thinking through next steps."" This week's ruling adds a new twist to Rushdie's complex relationship with India, where he was born in 1947, just before the country's independence. He left as a child and was living in the United Kingdom at the time of his breakout novel, ""Midnight's Children,"" which came out in 1981 and infuriated India's prime minister at the time, Indira Gandhi, who was satirized in the book. After she sued over a reference to her having caused her husband's death, Rushdie agreed to remove it and the case was settled. When India banned ""The Satanic Verses,"" Rushdie condemned the action and doubted whether his censors had even read the novel. In an open letter to then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, published in The New York Times in 1988, he alleged the book was ""being used as a political football"" and called the ban not only ""anti-democratic, but opportunistic."" Over the years, Rushdie has made private trips to India and attended the Jaipur Literary Festival in 2007. But five years later, he canceled plans to attend the Jaipur gathering because of security concerns. The festival did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. Besides the ban in his native country, ""The Satanic Verses"" elicited a fatwa calling for Rushdie's death from Iran's Ayotollah Ruhollah Khomeini, forcing the author into hiding in 1989. He gradually resumed a normal life, especially after Iranian officials announced in 1998 that the government had no plans to enforce it. But his relative calm abruptly ended in 2022, when he was stabbed repeatedly onstage by a young assailant during a literary festival in western New York. Rushdie survived the attack, which left him blind in one eye, and wrote about it in the memoir ""Knife,"" a finalist this year for the National Book Award. On Friday, Khan's lawyer said that his client was an avid book reader driven to find answers after he found out the novel was banned. He filed numerous requests for information with various authorities - and tried for over a year to get a hold of the notification. Mukherjee said Khan was told by authorities that it was not traceable. ""When we realized there was no hope, we proceeded to go to court and challenge the notification,"" Mukherjee added. The court also said that Khan has the right under law to procure this book. So how does he plan to get it now? ""He doesn't have a clear answer to this yet - if it becomes available in India, he will buy a copy of it,"" Mukherjee said. ""But he can also potentially buy it from international booksellers online, as it's no longer illegal to import the book into the country.""","rushdie, the, satanic, verses, book, salman, notification, gandhi, literary, new, ruling, publisher, ruhollah, palli, khomeini, penguin, paperwork, ayotollah, festival, ban"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/british-writer-samantha-harveys-space-station-novel-orbital-wins-the-booker-prize-for-fiction,British writer Samantha Harvey's space-station novel 'Orbital' wins the Booker Prize for fiction,Associated Press,2024-11-13 15:56:53,"LONDON, NOVEMBER 13 British writer Samantha Harvey won the Booker Prize for fiction on Tuesday with ""Orbital,"" a short, wonder-filled novel set aboard the International Space Station that ponders the beauty and fragility of Earth. Harvey was awarded the 50,000-pound ($64,000) prize for what she has called a ""space pastoral"" about six orbiting astronauts, which she began writing during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The confined characters loop through 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets over the course of a day, trapped in one another's company and transfixed by the globe's ever-changing vistas. ""To look at the Earth from space is like a child looking into a mirror and realizing for the first time that the person in the mirror is herself,"" said Harvey, who researched her novel by reading books by astronauts and watching the space station's live camera. ""What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves."" She said the novel ""is not exactly about climate change, but implied in the view of the Earth is the fact of human-made climate change."" She dedicated the prize to everyone who speaks ""for and not against the Earth, for and not against the dignity of other humans, other life."" ""All the people who speak for and call for and work for peace - this is for you,"" she said. Writer and artist Edmund de Waal, who chaired the five-member judging panel, called ""Orbital"" a ""miraculous novel"" that ""makes our world strange and new for us."" Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation, noted that ""in a year of geopolitical crisis, likely to be the warmest year in recorded history,"" the winning book was ""hopeful, timely and timeless."" Harvey, who has written four previous novels and a memoir about insomnia, is the first British writer since 2020 to win the Booker. The prize is open to English-language writers of any nationality and has a reputation for transforming writers' careers. Previous winners include Ian McEwan, Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and Hilary Mantel. De Waal praised the ""crystalline"" writing and ""capaciousness"" of Harvey's succinct novel - at 136 pages in its U.K. paperback edition, one of the shortest-ever Booker winners. ""This is a book that repays slow reading,"" he said. He said the judges spent a full day picking their winner and came to a unanimous conclusion. Harvey beat five other finalists from Canada, the United States, Australia and the Netherlands, chosen from among 156 novels submitted by publishers. American writer Percival Everett had been the bookies' favorite to win with ""James,"" which reimagines Mark Twain's ""Huckleberry Finn"" from the point of view of its main Black character, the enslaved man Jim. The other finalists were American writer Rachel Kushner's spy story ""Creation Lake""; Canadian Anne Michaels' poetic novel ""Held""; Charlotte Wood's Australian saga ""Stone Yard Devotional""; and ""The Safekeep"" by Yael van der Wouden, the first Dutch author to be shortlisted for the Booker. Harvey is the first female Booker winner since 2019, though one of five women on this year's shortlist, the largest number in the prize's 55-year history. De Waal said issues such as the gender or nationality of the authors were ""background noise"" that did not influence the judges. ""There was absolutely no question of box ticking or of agendas or of anything else. It was simply about the novel,"" he said before the awards ceremony at Old Billingsgate, a grand former Victorian fish market in central London. Founded in 1969, the Booker Prize is open to novels originally written in English published in the U.K. or Ireland. Last year's winner was Irish writer Paul Lynch for post-democratic dystopia ""Prophet Song."" Lynch handed Harvey her Booker trophy at the ceremony, warning her that her life was about to change dramatically because of the Booker publicity boost. Harvey said she was ""overwhelmed,"" but remained down-to-earth about spending her prize money. She said she'd disburse ""some of it on tax. I want to buy a new bike. And then the rest - I want to go to Japan.""","booker, novel, writer, prize, the, harvey, waal, station, space, samantha, wood, orbital, percival, twain, huckleberry, prophet, michaels, devotional, novels, kushner"

According to expedition organizers, hundreds of climbers have already descended to the base camp and Samagaon after their expedition on the world's eighth-highest peak to take heli flights back to Kathmandu. ""We will not allow heli flights to Samagaon region unless the government removes our area from the restricted zone,"" Karma Chhewang Lama, ward chairman of Samagaon, told THT. According to him, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal and the Home Ministry are playing foul with the locals of Tsum Nubri Rural Municipality by restricting them from using choppers in times of emergency. ""How can a foreigner get a flying permit within minutes, but locals have to wait for a week or more even for a medical evacuation flight?"" he questioned. RM Chairman Nima Lama said that he was trying his best to coordinate with locals and authorities to resume heli operations. ""Our executive board meeting has decided to urge the government for the removal of the Tsum Nubri area from the restricted zone at the earliest,"" he informed. Locals in northern Gorkha have called for a simplified helicopter flight process, citing delays in obtaining permissions. At a general assembly in Chumnubri Rural Municipality–1, Samagaon last Friday, they demanded that charter permissions be streamlined through a single office. Currently, it takes over a week for non-medical flights to be approved. Locals also requested immediate rescue operations based on police recommendations in emergencies. They further urged that if there are vacant seats on helicopters traveling to and from the northern region, locals should be allowed to board the helicopter by paying a minimum fee and with the recommendation of the concerned police and government authorities. They criticized the fees imposed on tourists in the Manaslu Conservation Area, noting a lack of infrastructure, and warned that if their demands aren't met within five days, they will halt helicopter operations. Chief District Officer Bhola Dahal stated that for rescue flights, recommendations are made within half an hour based on the patient's condition. For charter flights, recommendations are given only after assessing the situation and determining the need. Since the area is restricted, approval for helicopter flights requires a recommendation from the District Administration Office.","flights, samagaon, tsum, nubri, manaslu, helicopter, heli, operations, the, chumnubri, area, bhola, lama, recommendation, chairman, locals, nima, charter, rural, climbers"

Prime Minister Oli, who is leading a Nepali delegation to the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, said this at the World Leaders Forum organized by Columbia University on Monday. He clarified that the national aspiration of 'Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali' has been put forward to eradicate poverty and ensure the right of all to live with dignity. Speaking as the keynote speaker at a dialogue on 'Nepal's Journey of Democracy and Economic Development', he said there is only the data of students and youths who have gone abroad from Nepal but not that of returnees. Noting that the government has brought out programmes such as small scale industries and 'startups' for employment opportunities, PM Oli urged the youth to unite in nation-building as he was clear that the country could not transform without the youth. ""Nepal's economic situation is not very weak. On the contrary, I see a lot of potentials for its prosperity, which we will be able to achieve within a short time if we work hard"", he said, adding, ""We are a rising democracy. We are also neighbours of economic powers like India and China. In that sense, Nepal is in a position to become a multi-dimensional economy for economic development"". Saying that he was leading a government with two major parliamentary parties that had played a decisive role in Nepal's democratic movement, PM Oli said he had a resolution to maintain good governance and transparency. ""We have no other intention but to make Nepalis prosperous and happy. We are fully committed to the journey of prosperity"", the PM shared. Addressing the 'Lead Free Future: Partnership Launch and Pledging Event' organized by USAID and UNICEF, PM Oli expressed solidarity with the lead-free campaign. He said that Nepal has already understood that the use of lead has affected the health of children. He clarified that Nepal has been implementing the policy of freeing lead from its use with the understanding that it has affected the health of children and recently brought a bill related to food security in the parliament.

Addressing the Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement on Monday, she called attention of the world community for Joshi's release. Minister Rana said Nepal is eagerly waiting for Bipin Joshi's release and wanted the world community to support in this cause. Ten Nepalis lost their lives in the Hamas' assault on Israel on October 7, 2023. Hamas had taken Joshi captive after the attack. The Foreign Minister said the Government of Nepal condemned the raid by Hamas and it has been calling for Joshi's safe release. Stressing on the need of collective international efforts for establishing global peace, she said, ""We are at a critical confluence in history, facing highest number of conflicts. So, we have to work with high priority to protect citizens from armed conflicts."" The Minister rued that despite international efforts, the world continues to fail to stop wars, bring solutions, restore peace and tranquility, and give hope. ""Even as we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, the principles designed to protect civilians are being systematically ignored or misinterpreted by the resourceful and powerful countries,"" she said, calling for an immediate end to this situation, and for all to move forward with peace and co-existence. Referencing ongoing conflicts such as the wars in Israel and Palestine, and Russia and Ukraine, the minister called for an immediate ceasefire, release of hostages and full implementation of Council Resolution 2735 (2024). She further called for the urgent need for all parties to adhere to international humanitarian and human rights laws, ensure accountability for violations and respect for international law, including the UN Charter. Dr Rana condemned the indiscriminate attack on civilians, including the UN officials, humanitarian workers, journalists and health professionals, saying the devastation of Gaza on such a scale and the relentless death of civilians cannot be justified. She also drew the global attention to the near-total destruction of homes, schools, hospitals, and basic infrastructure, which has left the entire population in constant fear and deprived of basic necessities like food, education, health, and clean water. Dr Rana on the occasion urged the international community to put pressure on the warring parties, and find creative solutions to conflicts.

This brings the total number of people killed during today's protests to two. According to officials, a television journalist who arrived earlier to film a house that was allegedly set on fire by protesters died because he could not be rescued in time. ""When the fire department arrived, it was too late to extinguish the fire. That is why the rescue could not take place,"" Nepal Police spokesperson Dinesh Acharya told THT. Earlier, the Ministry of Home Affairs previously stated that one protester had died after being shot by police. According to police, four royalist protesters have been arrested so far. The Ministry of Home Affairs held a press conference to announce the death of Sabin Maharjan, 29, a resident of Kirtipur-4. The Ministry has not disclosed the cause of his death. A spokesperson for the Nepal Police said 15 civilians and some security personnel were injured during the protest. Furthermore, 50 police and 15 APF personnels sustained injuries during clashes. During the Tinkune protests, police used tear gas before firing rubber bullets and opening fire into the air. Social media users shared footage of protesters carrying police guns and carrying out deadly attacks. As the situation worsened, a curfew was imposed in the Tinkune area. The Tinkune protest turned violent resulting in arson, vandalism, and looting during clashes between pro-monarchy protesters and security forces. The protesters set ablaze and vandalised the political parties' office, as well as several houses. The Kathmandu District Administration Office decided to take this action to maintain control of the situation. The Nepali army was deployed to ensure the effectiveness of curfew. ""Curfew orders have been issued in Tinkune, Sinamangal, and Koteshwor areas to bring the situation under control,"" reads the notice issued by the Kathmandu DAO. Videos on social media and online media also showed police in the area announcing the impending curfew and urging residents to return home safely. The District Administration Office issued a notice imposing a curfew from 4:25 pm to 10 pm in accordance with the Local Administration Act, 2028 6(A). The curfew was later extended till 7:00 am tomorrow. Protesters have also vandalised several private and public properties and looted shops, including Bhatbhateni supermarkets and Koteshwor. Previously, a fire broke out in a private building in Tinkune, Kathmandu, where a royalist demonstration and gathering took place. The fire began during clashes between police and protesters. There have also been reports that protesters set the house ablaze. However, it has not been officially confirmed. Protesters even pelted stones at the fire engine, which was forced to pull back. The police then used tear gas before firing into the air. The clashes injured both police officers and protesters. Protesters also set ablaze a taxi near the CPN-UML office and two vehicles near the CCRC College near the Balkumari Bridge. The royalist protesters who were chased out of Tinkune, started vandalising and setting fires across the valley. Protesters also set ablaze the CPN-MC office in Paris Danda in the afternoon. Meanwhile, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the main opposition party's leader, claimed that monarchists were attempting to raise their heads when Republican parties failed to meet public expectations. Dahal stressed the importance of self-introspection. ""This is our failure because those relegated in history have spoken out. We are taking a serious look at ourselves, learning from our mistakes, and fighting for the people, the people."" He warned against trying to profit from the generosity of Nepali citizens and politicians. He warned former King Gyanendra Shah that he was now suffering the consequences of his previous mistakes and should not repeat them. He also stated that another revolution was required to completely eliminate feudal autocracy and crony capitalism. He claimed that the Republicans had made mistakes that others had taken advantage of and that they would now come clean and lead a new revolution. He also chastised royalist protesters for causing chaos and setting fires in Tinkune. Meanwhile, police arrested Rastriya Prajatantra Party leaders Rabindra Mishra and Dhawal Shamsher Rana on charges of inciting violence during a pro-monarchy protest in Kathmandu today. Rana is also a sitting RPP member. Mishra and Rana were accused of making incendiary speeches during protests today. Police placed royalist Nabaraj Subedi under house arrest. Monarchists had recently named Subedi as the coordinator for the pro-monarchy movement. Police also arrested monarchist Swagat Nepal, who is also a lawyer. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli held an emergency Cabinet meeting late in the evening. The meeting instructed the Home Ministry to investigate the incidents of violence committed by pro-monarchy protesters today and to take action against those responsible for the violence, according to government Spokesperson and Minister of Communication and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung.

""In a democratic republic, questions can be raised about our mistakes and shortcomings, and we are obligated to respond. However, under a monarchy, questioning or filing a case against the king was impossible,"" he stated. Reaffirming that autocracy is no alternative to democracy, he urged all stakeholders to operate within the legal framework to strengthen democratic institutions, warning that criticisms beyond lawful limits could erode democratic norms and values. Minister Lekhak strongly condemned the recent attacks, arson, and vandalism targeting businesses, media outlets, and political party offices, stressing the need to identify and hold the perpetrators accountable. While acknowledging the constitutional right to peaceful assembly, he denounced violent demonstrations, stating that the Tinkune incident had exposed the true nature of those opposing the current system.

Former party student leader Rekha Gupta, 50, was named New Delhi chief minister, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad announced. The party won the most seats in the high-stakes New Delhi polls earlier this month for the first time in 27 years. With 48 seats in the 70-member local assembly, Bharatiya Janata Party ousted the Aam Aadmi Party, which won 22 seats. Gupta thanked the party and said she would work hard to meet the challenges ahead. She faces significant tasks in tackling air and river pollution and poor infrastructure in the Indian capital. Before elections, her party had offered to revamp government schools, give free health services, free electricity, and a monthly stipend of over 2,500 rupees ($29) to poor women in Delhi. Gupta is the fourth female chief minister in Delhi, but it is still rare for Indian political parties to name women to top positions. The only other woman who is chief minister of a state currently is West Bengal's Mamata Banerjee, of the All India Trinamool Congress party. A law for India's legislatures to have 33% female membership is expected to be implemented by 2029. Women hold about 14% of parliamentary seats now, India's highest proportion since independence but far below the global average of 26.5%. Gupta, a former BJP general secretary, started out as a student leader at Delhi University in 1992. She is known for initiatives on the welfare of women and children, as well as support for impoverished female students. The BJP has not run Delhi for over a quarter of a century. It yielded power to the Congress party that ruled Delhi from 1998 to 2013, until the AAP burst onto the scene on an anti-corruption platform. The party's victory was a boost for the BJP after it failed to secure a majority on its own in last year's national election but formed the government with coalition partners. It gained some lost ground by winning three state elections in northern Haryana and Delhi and western Maharashtra. Ahead of the election earlier this month, the BJP slashed income taxes on the salaried middle class, one of its key voting blocs, in the federal budget. The AAP suffered a major setback when its founder and leader Arvind Kejriwal was arrested last year along with two other party officials on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. They have denied the accusation, claiming it was a part of a political conspiracy. Kejriwal and the two others were later released on bail by the Supreme Court and Kejriwal subsequently stepped down as Delhi chief minister.","party, delhi, the, seats, bjp, banerjee, minister, aap, arvind, kejriwal, mamata, new, bharatiya, gupta, ravi, leader, election, rekha, shankar, state"

Many of the victims were Hindu pilgrims who were traveling to the Maha Kumbh festival in Prayagraj in northern India, according to Delhi's caretaker chief minister, Atishi, who uses only one name. The stampede happened late Saturday while thousands of people were gathered at the New Delhi railway station waiting to board a train. The incident occurred after some passengers slipped and fell on others while coming down from a footbridge that connects train platforms, authorities said. Sheela Devi, who was at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narain Hospital in New Delhi to collect her daughter-in-law's body, said an announcement about a change of train platforms created confusion among the passengers that led to the stampede. ""The crowd went out of control and no one could control it,"" said Nikhil Kumar, a shopkeeper who witnessed the crowd surge. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he was ""distressed by the stampede."" ""My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery. The authorities are assisting all those who have been affected by this stampede,"" he said on the social platform X. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that an investigation has been ordered to find what led to the stampede.

Several pilgrims were injured, some seriously, in the stampede between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. as they tried to jump barricades erected for the movement of religious saints, Uttar Pradesh state's top elected official, Yogi Adityanath, said in a televised statement. He made no mention of any deaths even eight hours after the crush of pilgrims at the site. Some local news websites said 10 people had died. Distressed families lined up outside a makeshift hospital inquiring about their missing relatives, rescuers were helping the injured and police tried to manage the crowds. People's belongings like clothes, blankets and backpacks were strewn around the scene of the stampede. It was not immediately clear what triggered the panic. ""The situation is now under control, but there is a massive crowd of pilgrims,"" Adityanath said, adding that 90 million to 100 million pilgrims had congregated there. ""About 30 million people had taken the holy bath by 8 a.m. Wednesday,"" he said. Wednesday was a sacred day during the six-week festival, and authorities were expecting a record 100 million devotees to engage in a ritual bath at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. Hindus believe that a dip at the confluence will cleanse them of their past sins and end their process of reincarnation. The main draw are thousands of ash-smeared Hindu ascetics who make massive processions toward the confluence to bathe. Millions continued to throng the site even as police officials urged them over megaphones to avoid the confluence. Adityanath urged people to instead take baths at other riverbanks. The Maha Kumbh festival, held every 12 years, started on Jan. 13 and is the world's largest religious gathering. Authorities expect more than 400 million people to throng the pilgrimage site in total. Nearly 150 million people have already attended, including the likes of Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah and celebrities like Coldplay's Chris Martin. A sprawling tent city was built on the riverbanks to accommodate visitors. It has roads, electricity and water, 3,000 kitchens and 11 hospitals. About 50,000 security personnel are stationed in the city to maintain law and order and manage crowds, and more than 2,500 cameras monitor crowd movement and density so officials can try to prevent such crushes. Deadly stampedes are relatively common around Indian religious festivals, where large crowds gather in small areas. In 2013, at least 40 pilgrims who were taking part in the same festival were killed in a stampede at a train station in Prayagraj.","million, maha, kumbh, pilgrims, the, festival, people, uttar, rajnath, stampede, bath, prayagraj, amit, crowds, riverbanks, pradesh, martin, about, religious, chris"

This year is especially significant, as it occurs once in 144 years, making it an even more auspicious occasion for devotees from Nepal and around the world. Beyond its religious importance, the Mela has also changed into a major platform for holistic wellness, drawing individuals looking for both spiritual explanation and physical innovation. For many Nepalese, participating in the Shahi Snan (royal bath) is not only a sacred ritual to purify sins but also a profound opportunity for renewal of the body, mind, and soul. The Mela's focus on meditation, yoga, and other wellness practices aligns closely with Nepal's traditional health philosophies like Swasthya (well-being), strengthening the shared spiritual and wellness practices between the two cultures. As Nepal continues to promote health and wellness tourism, the Kumbh Mela offers invaluable insights into mixing spirituality with holistic health-an idea that deeply resonates with Nepalese values. Pilgrims often return from the Mela inspired to join these practices into their daily lives, enriching their own well-being and the lives of those around them. By acceptance the spiritual essence and wellness opportunities at the Kumbh Mela, Nepalese participants not only celebrate their shared heritage but also embark on a personal journey of transformation. This extraordinary event serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative power of spirituality in promoting holistic health and development peace and harmony that exceeds borders, especially as the Kumbh Mela takes place once every 144 years.","mela, wellness, kumbh, nepalese, 144, spiritual, snan, practices, holistic, pilgrims, shahi, health, being, the, philosophies, well, explanation, bath, triveni, essence"

""By next year we will not have to buy energy from other countries if the government focuses on it,"" he said. ""As a result, the government should accelerate this quick result yielding sectors with clarity in laws."" Dr Sandeep Shah, president Solar Energy Development in Nepal (SOPAN) said, ""I still love hydro and it's good as we are blessed with it, but I have experienced that numbers of hydropower centres are not functioning due to the impact of climate change for the past few years. Thus, solar energy comes as an alternative with immense potential if high radiating areas are leveraged."" According to him, Nepal has been importing dirty energy from India which is produced on coal that exacerbates climate change. ""We are not competing with hydro here but rather complementing it in the dry season by hybridising it. Hydro is good but it's not the only solution because climate change is rapidly impacting melting glaciers which are the chief source of hydropower. But the sun will always be there,"" he said.","energy, solar, pge, power, solutions, green, producers, projects, sandeep, development, independent, prozeal, golyan, footprints, tarkhala, techno, result, utilisation, venture, shah"

""I am attempting to climb Mt Shishapangma, the world's 14th and lowest peak in the eight-thousander category, this season,"" Vajpai said. According to him, this landmark climb is supported by Mpower, an initiative by the Aditya Birla Education Trust, pioneers in providing holistic mental health services. Standing at a formidable height of 8,027 meters (26,335 feet), Mt. Shishapangma is located in the Tibetan Himalayas. Vajpai is the only Indian mountaineer to have embarked on an incredible 16 expeditions throughout his mountaineering career. Having already successfully scaled seven out of the 14 eight-thousand-meter summits, Arjun is now set to make history for India. With this upcoming expedition, he will become the first Indian mountaineer to scale 8 of the 14 8000m peaks. Vajpai strongly believes that mental toughness and resilience play a critical role in achieving success in such demanding climbs. He emphasizes the vital role of mental strength alongside physical training in conquering challenges. According to Vajpai, mental health is just as important as physical health, and in today's fast-paced world, it is essential to focus on mental well-being and seek support when needed. As Vajpai himself shares, ""When the body gives up, the mind takes over, and the hardest and most unachievable task can be managed by the mind.""

Arjun's ultimate goal is to become the first Indian to scale all 14 of the world's 8000-meter summits, with Mt. Shisha Pangma as his next target. With fewer than 55 people in the world having ever achieved this feat, no Indian has done it yet. Vajpai has already scaled Mt. Everest, Mt. Lhotse, Mt. Makalu, Mt. Kanchenjunga, Mt. Manaslu, Mt. Annapurna, and Cho-Oyu, making several mountaineering world records along the way. As he notes, ""It is my dream to climb all 14 mountains above 8000 meters, raise India's flag high, and become the first Indian to have achieved this feat.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/ouster-of-bangladeshs-prime-minister-will-test-indias-regional-power-with-beijings-on-the-rise,"Ouster of Bangladesh's prime minister will test India's regional power, with Beijing's on the rise",Associated Press,2024-08-07 21:41:18,"NEW DELHI, AUGUST 7 The dramatic resignation of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina poses a dilemma for India's government, and the South Asian powerhouse could even see its influence in the region wane, according to experts. During her 15-year rule, Hasina cultivated deep ties with India, her biggest backer, as she oversaw an economic boom and drew the two countries closer on business, energy and defense. Bangladesh is India's biggest trade partner in South Asia, with bilateral trade of just under $16 billion. ""India will need much political and diplomatic skill in dealing with the consequences of the fall of Sheikh Hasina, which could rattle the geopolitics of the subcontinent, if not reshape it,"" C. Raja Mohan, a foreign affairs expert, told The Associated Press. Bangladesh under Hasina, the country's longest-serving prime minister, was also a safe bet security-wise for India: The 76-year-old was regarded as a secular leader, in the Muslim-majority nation of 170 million, who clamped down on anti-India insurgents. She tamed rising threats of Islamic militancy and kept the military in their barracks in a country with a history of army takeovers. This made Hasina's Bangladesh a critical partner to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the region became increasingly tense with an assertive China at the Himalayan borders, and longtime rival Pakistan with which India fought three wars. Her resignation has left a power vacuum that could be filled by a new government more friendly to China and Pakistan, analysts say, posing a challenge to Modi's efforts to make India a regional power, especially as border disputes drag on and heighten tensions with both. Hasina's Bangladesh was a crucial ally to India in maintaining regional stability, especially as other countries in South Asia have slowly drifted towards China, like Nepal which now has a government more amenable to aligning with Beijing's interests. India also faces a similar situation with the Maldives - as it swapped its India-leaning leader with a pro-China one - and Sri Lanka where China's influence remains considerable. Even though Hasina bolstered ties with New Delhi, she also maintained strong relations with Beijing which has bankrolled a slew of projects in Bangladesh. China is likely to continue to be a critical financial supporter of Bangladesh, especially amid growing economic distress, according to Teneo, a global consulting and advisory firm. ""The fall of Hasina's government raises the possibility of Bangladesh realigning itself with China,"" the firm added in a note. For the ousted prime minister, India has always been a safe haven. Hasina lived in exile in New Delhi after nearly her entire family was assassinated in 1975, including her father who was Bangladesh's first leader after gaining independence from Pakistan. She landed again in India Monday night after she was chased out of her country. It's not clear if Hasina will remain there. The protests started peacefully with students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs but later descended into violence and grew into a broader rebellion against Hasina. Critics say Hasina's heavy-handed approach to muzzling the protests, where at least 300 people died, according to media reports, escalated tensions, leading to her ouster. Western nations had previously expressed concerns over violations of human rights and press freedoms under Hasina's rule. In January, after she won a fourth consecutive term, the U.S. and the United Kingdom said the polls were not credible, free and fair. One of the main issues of concern following her resignation is the status of the Hindu minority in Bangladesh, which makes up nearly 8% of Bangladesh's population, according to a 2022 census. Some are worried they could come under attack for being seen as her supporters. They have been targeted in the past during political unrest, especially with the rise of Islamic groups in the 1990s which Hasina helped quash. ""The recent protest movement did have a strong anti-India flavor, primarily because the protesters saw India as a strong backer of Hasina,"" said Subir Bhaumik, a columnist and commentator. On Tuesday, India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said: ""What was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses and temples also came under attack at multiple locations,"" he said. ""The full extent of this is still not clear."" Jaishankar was referring to reports that had surfaced about attacks targeting minorities following Hasina's ouster. However, they couldn't be independently verified. Approximately 19,000 Indian nationals live in Bangladesh, including 9,000 students - many of whom have left Bangladesh following the protests, according to the Indian foreign minister. Following Hasina's escape, Bangladesh's president dissolved Parliament, clearing the way for an interim administration and new elections. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus will head Bangladesh's interim government. But uncertainties in Bangladesh as it tries to rebuild a new government and chart its way forward will be felt in India. New Delhi would be concerned if the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the main opposition to Hasina, were to gain power, given its history of supporting insurgent groups in India's northeastern states and ties with Pakistan, Teneo, the consulting firm, wrote in its note. The foreign affairs expert, Raja Mohan, agrees: ""Whether intended or not, New Delhi is far too closely identified with Hasina and the mounting hatred against her is bound to rub off against India.""","hasina, the, her, bangladesh, india, firm, ouster, minister, consulting, subrahmanyam, prime, resignation, backer, raja, modi, islamic, government, jaishankar, delhi, fall"

Rutte's appointment was sealed by NATO ambassadors during a meeting at the 32-nation alliance's headquarters in Brussels. U.S. President Joe Biden and his counterparts will formally welcome him to their table at a summit in Washington on July 9-11. The outgoing Dutch premier will take over from the current secretary general, Norway's Jens Stoltenberg, on Oct. 1. Stoltenberg spent more than a decade at the helm. His mandate was repeatedly extended, in part to provide continuity after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. ""I warmly welcome NATO allies' choice of Mark Rutte as my successor,"" Stoltenberg said. ""Mark is a true trans-Atlanticist, a strong leader, and a consensus-builder. I wish him every success as we continue to strengthen NATO for the challenges of today and tomorrow. I know I am leaving NATO in good hands,"" he added. Secretaries general chair meetings and guide often delicate consultations among member countries to ensure the organization, which operates on consensus, can function smoothly. The NATO leader also ensures decisions are put into action and speaks on behalf of all members. Several obstacles had stood in Rutte's way of security the post, even though he had the backing of the White House and most other big member countries including Germany. He emerged as the sole candidate after Romanian President Klaus Iohannis withdrew last week. Hungary lifted its objections earlier this month, once Rutte agreed that Budapest would not be obligated in the future to send personnel or provide funds for a new support plan for Ukraine. NATO's unanimous decision-making gives any member a veto over projects and operations. Turkey had also voiced opposition to Rutte's bid but lifted its objections in April.","rutte, nato, iohannis, stoltenberg, dutch, jens, klaus, outgoing, brussels, trans, member, builder, atlanticist, secretary, organization, general, the, objections, veto, biden"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/english-language-barrier-how-it-prevents-use-of-technology,English language barrier: How it prevents use of technology,Anup Kumar Ayadi,2024-03-13 11:52:40,"A few months ago, I could be seen trekking across the hilly, rugged terrain of my village in Bajhang – in an arduous one-hour journey to the ward office. I was here to make English translated copies of my vital documents, but as fate would have it, I ended up staying at the ward office for the rest of the day, helping officials use Microsoft word to format and print several other documents as well. By the time I was on my back home, it was evening. I did not mind though, and the officials were grateful for having a huge load come off their shoulders: using the computer. The events of the day did make me wonder: What sets back many people in Nepal from using technology proficiently? In an age where digital accessibility is valued by many companies and governments, most software is made to be easily understood and navigated by the general population. But from my own personal observation, in my home for example, relatives and family members often have me do simple things for them like creating new Gmail accounts, downloading apps, registering online forms and so on. Technology to them is not as comprehensible as it is to me, who has been exposed to smartphones ever since childhood. But more significant than that, I realised, is the English language barrier that is preventing them from gaining confidence in using these applications. Most computer systems currently used by the Nepali people have an English language interface. Most messages, captions, warnings, headings and instructions on our computer or mobile phone screens are displayed in English. The internet is filled to the brim with English content, from blogs, health websites and online Wikipedia to international news portals and shopping platforms. Our social media is inundated with English posts, messages and notifications. Even websites of Nepali non-profits, youth organisations, businesses and personal portfolios are written down in English. Aside from governmental websites, Nepali news portals, occasional Nepali tweets and some amount of Nepali video content, our local language is hard to come by in the digital world. The situation is even more observable in graphical user interfaces of operating systems and offline computer applications. Consequently, people not comfortable with the English language have a hard time navigating the digital world. Learning to use software applications where everything is labeled in an unfamiliar language becomes daunting. Lack of tech support services in the local language intensifies this issue. For instance, there exists a vast array of resources such as how-to-articles and videos to help customers use software and digital products on the internet. But since most of this is communicated in English, non-English speakers face limited and subpar Nepali alternatives compared to the abundance and quality of resources available otherwise. Newer technologies that could potentially benefit many fall short of delivering their potential because of the language barrier. Good examples are AI chatbots like Open AI's Chat GPT, Google's Gemini or Microsoft's Bard. They are quite helpful so long as you can chat with them in English. Every year, when the season is just right, you can see the hustle and bustle in unofficial electronic DV form filling stations, where people hankering after the enticing chance of going to the US come to submit the forms for a few hundred rupees. Perhaps, an even more perennial flurry of activity happens at unofficial passport form filling stations, right outside the building of the Department of Passports. While it's reasonable for those without access to a computer to utilise these facilities, filling an online form is hardly a technical task. Still many prefer these services over filling online forms themselves. This could be because of lack of confidence in using digital applications and technology. Subsequently, the language barrier has a direct role in magnifying this lack in confidence. This is because understanding how to use computers and software becomes more intuitive when you can read the text on the screen. Let's illustrate this with a simple hypothetical scenario. Imagine using Microsoft Word and you encounter the 'Find' and 'Replace' options on the toolbar. You might not immediately understand their functions. However, if you understand the meanings of the words, you could intuitively guess that the 'Find' option allows you to locate any word or phrase in the document, and perhaps the 'Replace' option enables you to substitute those words with others. This intuition is not accessible to individuals who are unfamiliar with the English language. One straightforward answer to solving the language barrier is translation. However, translation comes with its own range of difficulties. It is tricky to provide quality translation for the vast amount of content present in the digital world. Furthermore, unlike English, Nepali did not evolve to be well integrated with technological interfaces and often, there exist no good alternatives in Nepali to technological and other jargons. It also takes extra effort from all entities that work in the digital domain to make their website and content available in Nepali as well. However, successful integration of our own language in the digital world is possible and beneficial, so relevant organisations and the government should allocate time, money and people to work on this end. While an internet completely translated in Nepali may appear appealing, individually, the most immediate step one can take is to try to understand computer systems intuitively by learning the rudimentary skills of English necessary to navigate the digital world. While technological interfaces use English, the language used is often very simple, and running that extra mile will make us more comfortable with computers, making us more productive in our work.","language, the, computer, english, applications, microsoft, word, barrier, digital, websites, replace, interfaces, portals, internet, nepali, find, alternatives, my, software, systems"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/conflict-in-the-middle-east-is-affecting-a-key-energy-lifeline-for-europe-how-big-is-the-risk,Conflict in the Middle East is affecting a key energy lifeline for Europe. How big is the risk?,Associated Press,2024-02-07 23:10:08,"FRANKFURT, FEBRUARY 7 Missiles and drones are flying in the Red Sea, disrupting one of the world's key trade arteries and a chokepoint for energy shipments headed for Europe. Attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels over Israel's war with Hamas are posing a new threat to the future of energy supplies to the 27-country European Union, which relies on imported natural gas to power factories, generate electricity and heat homes. Tankers carrying liquefied natural gas - which is supercooled to travel by ship instead of pipeline - routinely pass through the Red Sea, and several shipments to Italy already have been canceled. It's causing anxiety, especially as Europe still is grappling with the fallout from an energy crisis after Russia largely cut off natural gas to the continent over the invasion of Ukraine. Here are key things to know about the threat to Europe's energy supplies from conflict in the Middle East: WHAT IS GOING ON WITH RED SEA SHIPPING? The Iranian-backed Houthis have been firing drones and missiles at ships that pass by territory they control near the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait at the southern end of the Red Sea. The Houthis say they are striking Israel-bound ships to support the Hamas militant group in its war with Israel, although other ships have been targeted as well. In response, the U.S. and the U.K. have been attacking Houthi launch sites in Yemen since mid-January. Security concerns have led shipping and some energy companies to reroute vessels around the southern tip of Africa instead of through the Suez Canal at the northern end of the Red Sea. That is lengthening the journey to Europe from suppliers in the Middle East, like Qatar, by a week or more and raising costs. Around 70% of LNG shipments from Qatar that were headed for Italy's major terminal on the Adriatic Sea were canceled in January. Last year, Qatar supplied 40% of Italy's LNG. WHAT IS LNG AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? Cooling natural gas to minus 162° C (minus 260° F) changes it into a liquid and reduces its volume by 600 times so it can be stored and shipped aboard specially designed vessels. Upon arrival, it's reheated into gas and transported by pipeline to distribution companies, industrial consumers and power plants. Europe relied for decades on gas transported through pipelines from Russia. That came to an abrupt end after Russia invaded Ukraine and cut off most of its supply. LNG became a lifeline, with the German government, for example, hastily lining up floating import terminals on its northern coast. Last year, 12.9% of Europe's LNG went through the Red Sea from suppliers in the Middle East, mainly Qatar. That means ""an extended shut-in of the Red Sea route from the Middle East poses a supply risk to Europe,"" said Kaushal Ramesh, vice president at Rystad Energy. WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON SUPPLIES AND PRICES? So far, there's been little to no impact on natural gas prices. In fact, spot prices for natural gas have fallen since the Houthi attacks began, from around 45 euros ($48.38) per megawatt hour before the start of the Israel-Hamas war to 28.37 euros Tuesday. Europe is getting a break because demand for natural gas is weak amid a sluggish economy. Slow growth in China also has reduced competition. And LNG shipments from the U.S. don't have to go through the Red Sea. Meanwhile, pipeline gas is still flowing from Norway and Azerbaijan, and Europe is buying some LNG from Russia despite sanctions. A key factor has been Europe's efforts to fill underground storage with gas ahead of winter: Storage is over 70% full with most of the heating season over. That means ""the price impact will be delayed until Europe's gas storage has been drawn down sufficiently,"" Rystad's Ramesh said. Things were different in 2022 when the war in Ukraine began. Russia's cutoff sent gas prices rising sharply, surging inflation to record highs and helping drive a cost-of-living crisis. European governments and companies raced to secure alternatives. But now, Europe's gas market is ""well supplied,"" said Simone Tagliapietra, an energy analyst at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. Abundant storage means ""a very good buffer"" against any interruptions or delays in gas shipments. WHAT COULD GO WRONG? There are fears the Israel-Hamas war could spread to other countries in the region, particularly Iran, and lead to disruption of shipping through the Strait of Hormuz at the end of the Persian Gulf. That's a key route not just for LNG but for oil, too. So far, Iran and the U.S., Israel's key ally, have indicated they want to avoid a wider war. But the invasion of Ukraine has shown that in the unsettled state of the world, unexpected things can happen. ""There is always a 'but,'"" Tagliapietra said. ""The risk is an escalation that affects the Strait of Hormuz."" HOW IMPORTANT IS U.S. GAS TO EUROPE? U.S. gas exports rose sharply after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and the Biden administration has celebrated deliveries to Europe and Asia as a key geopolitical weapon against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since then, President Joe Biden has paused approving new proposals for LNG export terminals. The pause would allow officials to study the impact of LNG projects on climate change, the U.S economy and national security, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said. The action would not affect five terminals that are already approved and under construction, she said. Industry association Eurogas called Biden's action ""alarming"" and said U.S. gas imports are ""set to play a crucial role for European energy security″ in case of possible shortfalls. Analyst Tagliapeitra said, however, that with plenty of new export capacity already approved, Biden's decision would have ""no short-term or even medium-term impact on Europe."" US LNG capacity has doubled since exports began in earnest less than a decade ago, and it's set to double again under already-approved projects. The wisdom of investing more money in fossil fuel infrastructure is also being debated in Europe, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels by 2030. Europe's gas demand is expected to fall 8% over 2022-2026 as renewable energy like solar and wind power is scaled up. ""Expanding LNG infrastructure in the USA and in the EU is a high economic risk that will very likely end up as stranded assets,"" said Claudia Kemfert, an economic expert at the German Institute of Economic Research and professor at Leuphana University.","gas, lng, energy, the, europe, shipments, sea, impact, terminals, biden, key, storage, strait, houthi, prices, war, analyst, israel, rystad, mandab"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/werner-toney-henderson-mbappe-the-key-players-set-for-possible-premier-league-transfers,"Werner, Toney, Henderson ... Mbappé? The key players set for possible Premier League transfers",Associated Press,2024-01-08 22:30:01,"LONDON, JANUARY 8 It has been a slow start to the January transfer window in the Premier League. Expect that to change pretty quickly. Deals are being mooted, speculation is starting to fly, sought-after stars - like Kylian Mbappé and Ivan Toney - have chosen to talk about their future to the media. Here's a look at the situation surrounding a number of key players and teams: TIMO WERNER Timo Werner might have won the Champions League during his time with Chelsea from 2020-22 but it was still an underwhelming stint in English soccer for the Germany forward. It looks like he'll be returning to England - to London again, too - in a bid to ignite his career ahead of the European Championship. Werner is widely reported to be close to joining Tottenham from Leipzig, initially on loan but with a view to a permanent move. In the short term, he would plug a gap left by the departure of captain Son Heung-min to the Asian Cup potentially until mid-February. ""It's right that Timo wants to go on loan,"" Leipzig coach Marco Rose said over the weekend, without name-checking Tottenham. ""Timo would like to go to the European Championship."" IVAN TONEY Ivan Toney's eight-month suspension for breaching betting rules is almost over, with the Brentford striker available again from Jan. 17. It is interesting timing, with a number of top teams seemingly in need of a proven scorer for the second half of the season. Toney would fit the bill - he was third in the Premier League's scoring charts last season, behind only Erling Haaland and Harry Kane - and he has been heavily linked with Arsenal, which is in the midst of a scoring slump that is perplexing manager Mikel Arteta. Toney gave an interview to British broadcaster Sky Sports, published Monday, in which he said he owes Brentford for sticking by him during his long ban. Brentford manager Thomas Frank has said Toney won't be sold in January, and the team needs its star striker after plunging into relegation danger in recent weeks. Money talks, though, and Toney's future could be a talking point right until the end of the window. LEAVING SAUDI? Jordan Henderson took plenty of flak when he decided to join the exodus of players moving to Saudi Arabia on lucrative deals, with advocates of LGBTQ+ rights feeling let down by the former Liverpool captain because he has been an outspoken supporter in the past. Six months later and it appears he wants out, with sections of the British media reporting he will consider a return to the Premier League this month after struggling to settle in the Middle East. Similarly, Roberto Firmino - another former Liverpool player - is reportedly willing to leave the Saudi league and Karim Benzema could yet be enticed back to Europe to return to playing at the highest level. Tottenham and Chelsea could be options for Henderson as they have been light on central midfielders at times this season. KYLIAN MBAPPE Something has to give soon in the ongoing transfer saga involving Kylian Mbappé, arguably the world's best player. His contract at Paris Saint-Germain is up at the end of the season, when he can leave for nothing. PSG is saying the club will not let him go for free. Mbappe appears happy to stay until the summer, and scored a hat trick in PSG's 9-0 win over sixth-tier side Revel in the French Cup on Sunday. The widespread belief is that Mbappé will end up at Real Madrid, though there is scope for a team from the lucrative Premier League to come in for him. Liverpool has long seemed the most likely destination for the France international if he did move to England. The departure of Mohamed Salah, potentially to Saudi Arabia, would leave a gap in Liverpool's forward line but that won't happen before the summer, by which time it could be too late. A move to Manchester United, a team that could afford Mbappé's wages, as the centerpiece of a new era for the club seems fanciful given it is far from assured of playing in the Champions League next season. CHELSEA Chelsea has spent more than $1 billion on players over the past three transfer windows. It doesn't look like the club is about to stop there. Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino has spoken of the need for more reinforcements this month, with the team languishing in 10th place in the Premier League at the halfway point of the season and in danger of missing out on qualifying for European competition for a second straight year. A striker might be required - the club has long been linked with Napoli's Victor Osimhen and Toney - while a midfield playmaker is a possibility if Chelsea decides to move on Conor Gallagher. Chelsea might need to sell before it buys in order to meet financial rules.","toney, the, ivan, werner, timo, league, chelsea, season, premier, osimhen, saudi, kylian, rose, transfer, pochettino, heung, mauricio, striker, frank, liverpool"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/wolves-hang-on-to-beat-wasteful-chelsea-2-1-in-sole-premier-league-christmas-eve-fixture,Wolves hang on to beat wasteful Chelsea 2-1 in sole Premier League Christmas Eve fixture,Associated Press,2023-12-24 21:50:38,"WOLVERHAMPTON, DECEMBER 24 Chelsea slumped to a third defeat in four Premier League games as second-half goals from Mario Lemina and Matt Doherty earned Wolverhampton a deserved 2-1 victory at Molineux on Sunday. Lemina headed in unmarked from Pablo Sarabia's corner early in the second period, just reward after Gary O'Neil's side had weathered early pressure and the hosts had spurned a host of chances, most glaringly from Raheem Sterling. Chelsea labored to find a way back, but as has been the case for much of the season, failed to find the key pass in the final third, with Cole Palmer ineffective. Then in stoppage time and with the visitors committed forward, Wolves broke and Hugo Bueno crossed for Doherty to take advantage of a poor clearance to slot home a second. Substitute Christopher Nkunku headed his first Chelsea goal in the dying minutes, but Mauricio Pochettino's side slipped to a third away league defeat on the spin. Armando Broja spurned the game's first opening. After Sterling fed Malo Gusto down the right, his low cross into the box arrived perfectly at the foot of the Albanian, playing as a lone striker with Nicolas Jackson moved to the wing. Looking to shoot first time, Broja missed and the chance was gone. Sterling was Chelsea's most dangerous threat in the first half, running at Wolves down either flank and pitching inviting deliveries. The best of them fell to Jackson who had found space, but as the ball dropped, his touch failed to match his movement and the pass squirmed beneath his foot and away. Then after half an hour, it was Sterling's turn to spurn a chance. The England international did brilliantly to harry and dispossess Joao Gomes, Wolves' last man, who dithered on the ball deep in his own half. With the defense stranded upfield, Sterling advanced on goal with Jackson and Palmer wide open beside him. Either player would have had a tap-in but Sterling went alone and hit a weak shot straight at Jose Sa. Wolves' best chances of the half came in the closing seconds, first when Sarabia fired just wide from the edge of the box via a deflection, then Hee Chan Hwang raced clear of Levi Colwill from a ball over the top and lashed over. They began the second half with similar urgency, Gomes hitting a shot that nicked off Lesley Ugochukwu and grazed the post before defender Toti got forward from the back and drew an outstanding point-blank save from Chelsea's stand-in goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic. It was a warning the visitors did not heed and the goal moments later was an almost carbon copy of Toti's chance. Sarabia's corner dropped into the heart of the Chelsea penalty area, but despite the obvious danger no one in blue jumped or moved to attack the ball. That left Lemina with a simple header, climbing above the grounded Ugochukwu to nod toward the back post and in beyond the stranded Petrovic. Pochettino sent on Nkunku for his Premier League debut, with the ineffectual Broja departing. He nearly offered Chelsea instant reprieve, denied on the goal line by Toti, who booted clear. Sterling then went close again, set up by Palmer on the right after Nkunku had picked him out only for an heroic last-ditch block from Craig Dawson diverting the ball over Sa's crossbar. The balance of the game was tipping in Chelsea's favour. But it was their growing confidence that led to their undoing. Three minutes into added time, Bueno broke down the left, Benoit Badiashile's attempted clearance was atrocious and Doherty crashed it home to take the roof of Molineux. Nkunku headed in from Sterling's cross minutes later, but few Chelsea fans had stayed to see it. The victory moves Wolves up to 11th in the table, equal on points with their visitors from West London but with an inferior goal difference.","chelsea, the, petrovic, sarabia, half, sterling, league, ugochukwu, broja, djordje, toti, nkunku, pablo, benoit, gary, badiashile, premier, pochettino, neil, clearance"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/can-arsenal-liverpool-or-aston-villa-end-man-citys-premier-league-dominance,"Can Arsenal, Liverpool or Aston Villa end Man City's Premier League dominance?",Associated Press,2023-12-22 22:58:32,"MANCHESTER, DECEMBER 22 While Manchester City is away, its Premier League title rivals have been getting into position to try to end the three-time defending champions' domestic dominance. Pep Guardiola has spent this week in Saudi Arabia, aiming to add the Club World Cup to the treble of trophies his team won in 2023. But back home, its title defense is faltering after a run of just one win in six games in England's top division. And having won the trophy in five of the last six seasons, City appears to face a wider challenge to its supremacy than at any point under Guardiola. Fourth-place City trails leader Arsenal by five points and doesn't return to league play until Dec. 27 at Everton. Arsenal led the league for 248 days last season before finally being overtaken by City, but this time there are challenges from several angles, with Liverpool and Aston Villa both in contention. ARSENAL It remains to be seen what lessons Arsenal has learned after pushing City so close last season. No team has led the Premier League for as long in a campaign without winning the title. Arsenal spent heavily to build on its rapid progress last year, with Declan Rice joining for a reported $138 million transfer from West Ham in the offseason. It is paying off so far as Mikel Arteta's team sits atop the Premier League and will be guaranteed to retain first place by Christmas if it beats Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday. Liverpool trails Arsenal by one point. Arsenal has already shown its credentials by beating City twice this season, first in a penalty shootout in the Community Shield and then in the league at Emirates Stadium in October. A win against Liverpool would be further evidence that it could go one better than last year. LIVERPOOL Of the likely challengers to City, Jurgen Klopp is the only manager who has gotten the better of Guardiola through Liverpool's title triumph in 2020. Second-place Liverpool's resurgence has come as a surprise given it missed out on Champions League qualification last season and has seen a host of star players depart over the past 18 months. But Klopp looks like he has put together a squad that is capable of challenging again - and his team is still in contention to win four trophies this season, having advanced to the semifinals of the League Cup and the round of 16 in the Europa League. Liverpool plays Arsenal next month in the third round of the FA Cup. Much may depend on Mohamed Salah's form, given Liverpool no longer has the firepower of Sadio Mane to call on, with Darwin Nunez, Cody Gakpo and Diogo Jota less prolific than the Senegal forward. ASTON VILLA Unai Emery has worked wonders with a team that was threatened with relegation when he took over last season. Villa - level on points with Liverpool and in third place on goal difference - plays Sheffield United on Friday with a shot to take the league lead. Villa is the surprise package of the season, having beaten City and Arsenal in recent weeks. Few expect Villa to maintain its challenge, but few expected Emery's team to be in this position at this stage of the season either. OTHER CHALLENGERS It is unlikely that a challenge to City will from anywhere else this season, but Tottenham impressed at the start of the campaign before injuries took their toll on Ange Postecoglou's team. Spurs are a point behind City in fifth place. Sixth-place Newcastle is five points behind City, and Manchester United is in seventh a further point back. Neither of those teams look likely to mount a serious title bid.","league, arsenal, the, villa, emery, place, title, liverpool, team, premier, aston, challengers, champions, city, ange, postecoglou, trails, unai, challenge, dominance"

A 1-0 win at Villa Park set a new club record of 15 straight home victories in the league and moved Emery's team to within two points of first-placed Liverpool. How sweet it must have been for the Spanish coach to get the better of his former club after being fired by Arsenal in 2019. He had already rebuilt his reputation before taking over a Villa team that was in danger of being relegated last season. But his work with the Midlands club could be his finest yet in a career that has seen him win four Europa League titles. Third-placed Villa looks like a serious title contender after a recent run that includes wins against Manchester City and Tottenham. ""We are increasing mentality and believing how we can be stronger,"" Emery said. ""We want to be in the top eight teams, but a lot of teams want to be there. At the beginning there were seven top teams, but we will fight to be in there. While we are in we can be excited and motivated to get it."" John McGinn scored the only goal after seven minutes and Villa held on to deny late-goal specialist Arsenal an equalizer that manager Mikel Arteta believed was the least his team deserved. ""I'm really proud of the way the team played in this stadium against this team,"" Arteta said. ""We deserved to win the game, but you have to be better in the boxes and things have to go your way as well. ""I see many, many teams come here and I haven't seen many do what we have done to them today. The result is not there but, certainly, the way we played it was there."" Arsenal led the league at the start of the day and dropped to second and a point behind Liverpool. LUCKY LIVERPOOL Manager Jurgen Klopp was relieved after ""lucky"" Liverpool pulled off a comeback 2-1 win at Crystal Palace. Klopp admitted his team was ""horrendous"" as it trailed 1-0 at Selhurst Park after Jean-Philippe Mateta's penalty in the 57th. The attitude and momentum flipped when Palace's Jordan Ayew was sent off in the 75th and a minute later Mo Salah's deflected shot levelled the score. Almost inevitably, Harvey Elliott struck from distance to seal victory in stoppage time. ""I'm a very happy manager in this moment, but I know we were lucky as well,"" Klopp said. ""If you only win your really good games you have no chance to be really successful, that's how it is, and obviously today was not a really good game from us. ""For 76 minutes it was a really bad performance."" SALAH'S RECORD Salah's latest landmark goal launched Liverpool's revival at Selhurst Park. The Egypt international reached 200 goals for Liverpool - the fifth man to the mark - and 150 in the Premier League, which moved him into the all-time top 10, tied with Michael Owen. ""The most important thing was that we won the game,"" Salah said. ""It's a great feeling. I'm happy for the record and that we won the game."" FANS TURN Erik ten Hag looked like he had the weight of the world on his mind after another setback for Manchester United against Bournemouth. An abject performance by United at home saw it lose 3-0 and spark loud jeers from the Old Trafford crowd. Goals by Dominic Solanke, Philip Billing and Marcos Senesi piled the misery on Ten Hag, a day after he was named the Premier League manager of November. It was United's seventh defeat in the league and 11th defeat in all competitions. It was all the more perplexing just three days after United's mood-lifting defeat of Chelsea by 2-1. United missed a chance to go level on points with fourth-placed Manchester City. ""Of course (I'm) annoyed, disappointed, definitely. I expected something different,"" Ten Hag said. ""I hoped before the game you can build on the performance and result from Chelsea, so it's very disappointing."" WILDER WINS It didn't take long for Chris Wilder to get a reaction from Sheffield United after returning to the club as manager this week. Having suffered defeat to Liverpool in midweek, he led his team to a 1-0 win against Brentford in his second game in charge. James McAtee scored the decisive goal in first-half stoppage time. But Sheffield United remained at the bottom of the table after 19th-placed Burnley drew with Brighton 1-1. The bottom two are level on eight points each. COOPER PRESSURE Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper faced mounting speculation about his job after losing 5-0 at Fulham in the week. His team led at Wolves on Saturday through Harry Toffolo, but was denied a win by Matheus Cunha's strike. A 1-1 draw at least halted Forest's four-game losing run.","the, cooper, salah, league, manager, liverpool, manchester, villa, placed, wilder, misery, ayew, team, premier, ten, club, united, mateta, klopp, cunha"

Defeat in the round-of-16 game was United's eighth loss in all competitions this season and the latest blow for English soccer's most storied club. ""It is below the standards everyone expects from Manchester United. It is not good enough by far,"" Ten Hag said. ""We have to put it right. I take responsibility for it. It is my team and they are not performing. I have to share it with my players, but I am responsible."" It is 10 years since United was last competing for club soccer's biggest prizes when it won the Premier League title in former manager Alex Ferguson's final season. The wait to return to its former glories looks as far away now as at any point since then, with its current form pointing toward another season of disappointment. The League Cup may not be a priority for a club of United's stature, but it provided Ten Hag's finest moment in the job when in February he led the team to the trophy by beating Newcastle at Wembley Stadium and ended its six-year wait for silverware. That is a distant memory as United's season continues to slide. United suffered a 3-0 loss at home to Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday, and Saudi-backed Newcastle's repeat of that scoreline raises further questions for Ten Hag. The Dutch coach, who won three league titles with Ajax, was mocked by Newcastle's fans throughout the game as they chanted that he would be fired in the morning. While there has been no suggestion Ten Hag's position is under threat, United's poor form is of growing concern. After the game he described himself as ""a fighter,"" adding he was confident he would overcome a troubled start to the campaign. ""At all my clubs I have done it and also last year here I did it as well, but at this moment we are in a bad place,"" he said. ""I see it as a challenge."" Newcastle was too much of a challenge on Wednesday as first-half goals from substitute Miguel Almiron and Lewis Hall put the visitors in control by the break and Joe Willock completed the scoring after an hour. Defeat came despite Ten Hag naming a starting lineup that had cost around half a billion dollars - even without $82 million off-season signing Rasmus Hojlund, as well as Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford. By the time those players were called for in an attempt to turn the game around in the second half, Ten Hag had fielded around $720 million of talent. It made little difference to the outcome. ""As a team we are not good enough and whatever the reasons are, it is no space for excuses,"" said Ten Hag. ""We have to do things better and we have to raise our standards because otherwise you never get the right levels and performance and never get the results."" United had offered little penetration in the first half and went behind in the 28th minute after being caught on the break. Alejandro Garnacho lost possession in Newcastle's half, which gave Tino Livramento the chance to burst forward and find the run of Almiron, who beat Andre Onana from inside the box. The lead was doubled eight minutes later, with United once again guilty of creating problems for itself. Indecisiveness at the back eventually led to Harry Maguire tamely heading Willock's cross from the left. His clearance only went as far as the edge of the area, where Hall was waiting to volley through a crowd of players and into the bottom corner. Ten Hag made changes at halftime, notably taking off his captain Casemiro. But Newcastle extended its lead when Willock carried the ball to the edge of the area and swept a low shot past Onana. Newcastle now travels to Chelsea in the quarterfinals. ""We hope to go one better than last season,"" Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said. CHELSEA ADVANCES Chelsea put its troubles in the league behind it with a 2-0 win against second division Blackburn. Defeat against Brentford over the weekend left the London club in 11th place in the standings and facing a fight to challenge for Champions League qualification. But manager Mauricio Pochettino moved a step closer to his first trophy in charge as goals from Benoit Badiashile and Raheem Sterling secured the win against Blackburn at Stamford Bridge. Everton is also finding joy in this competition. While it looks like being another league battle for survival for the Merseyside club, it saw off Burnley 3-0 at Goodison Park and now faces a home match against Fulham in the quarterfinals. Fulham secured its place in the last eight with a 3-1 win against second division Ipswich. KLOPP'S CUP? Darwin Nunez scored a 70th-minute winner as Liverpool won 2-1 at Bournemouth. Jurgen Klopp's team won the competition in 2022 and is back in the hunt for more silverware after ending last season trophyless. Liverpool is the highest-ranked team left in the cup and next hosts West Ham, which beat Arsenal 3-1. UNDERDOGS There will be a team from outside of the Premier League in the semifinals after third division Port Vale was drawn against second-tier Middlesbrough.","the, league, hag, ten, klopp, united, cup, newcastle, manchester, season, club, half, willock, almiron, chelsea, miguel, pochettino, vale, jurgen, mauricio"

Tel scored with a spectacular finish in the second minute of injury time, restoring Bayern's two-goal lead just when United threatened to pull off another remarkable comeback after Casemiro scored in the 88th. Casemiro did score again in the fifth minute of stoppages with a header to Bruno Fernandes' free kick, but this time there was no fairy-tale ending for United, which beat Bayern with two late goals to win the 1999 Champions League final. United had forced the initiative early as the old rivals met again in the group stage, but Harry Kane's penalty in the 53rd for 3-1 seemed to be the final blow for an injury-hit team low on confidence after starting the Premier League with three defeats in five games. United was without the injured Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, Tyrell Malacia, Mason Mount and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, and coach Erik ten Hag was forced to name three goalkeepers among his substitutes. Ten Hag's counterpart Thomas Tuchel was suspended for his sending off in Bayern's quarterfinal loss to Manchester City last season. Assistants Zsolt Löw and Anthony Barry took charge. United almost grabbed a shock early lead with Alphonso Davies sliding in to deny Facundo Pellistri from close range. Bayern goalkeeper Sven Ulreich denied Christian Eriksen from the rebound. Bayern had to wait till the 20th minute for its first chance and had fortune on its side with United 'keeper André Onana deflecting Leroy Sané's harmless-looking shot inside the right post in the 28th after Sané had played a one-two with Kane. ""We started the game well and mistakes is part of football,"" United defender Victor Lindelöf said. ""We tried to get back into the game, but we were playing against a very strong team as well. But of course, it's not the result that we wanted."" Serge Gnabry capitalized on Sané's blow by adding another goal four minutes later, sweeping a shot from distance inside the far post after a fine run from Jamal Musiala to set him up. Höjlund scored with a deflected shot early in the second half, but Danish compatriot Eriksen was penalized through VAR for hand ball after Dayot Upamecano headed the ball into his hand. Kane duly converted the penalty for his first Champions League goal in a Bayern jersey. The six-time champion maintained control until Casemiro restored some excitement to the finish. ""It's a bit paradoxical. We were much better in the second half than we were in the first, and we lost the second in the end while we won the first, 2-0,"" Tuchel told broadcaster DAZN. ""It's very important for confidence and development. But there are still things that we have to do better.""

United has started the Premier League with three losses in its opening five games and was booed by its own fans after the latest defeat against Brighton on Saturday. Off-field issues involving Mason Greenwood, Jadon Sancho and Antony have provided unwanted distractions for United manager Erik ten Hag, who insisted after losing to Brighton that the team is not in crisis. Wednesday's trip to Munich could deal Ten Hag's players another blow - unless he manages to galvanize the team to atone for its poor start. United defeated Bayern in improbable circumstances before. Injury-time goals from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær earned United the 1999 Champions League title with a 2-1 win over Bayern in the final. Bayern, the 11-time defending champion in the Bundesliga, is unbeaten so far this season, though it dropped its first points Saturday when Bayer Leverkusen came from behind to draw 2-2 in Munich. Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel is suspended following his sending off in the team's loss to Manchester City in the quarterfinals last season. Tuchel will be forced to watch the game from the stands and it's likely Zsolt Löw and Anthony Barry will direct the team in his place. United will be without right back Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who was injured after making a short appearance toward the end of Saturday's loss to Brighton.","munich, bayern, league, manchester, ten, tuchel, champions, hag, united, thomas, trip, distractions, solskjær, greenwood, sheringham, jadon, sancho, gunnar, löw, ole"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/union-berlin-signs-italy-captain-leonardo-bonucci-to-bolster-defense-for-champions-league,Union Berlin signs Italy captain Leonardo Bonucci to bolster defense for Champions League,Associated Press,2023-09-01 22:06:13,"BERLIN, SEPTEMBER 1 Union Berlin signed Italy captain Leonardo Bonucci on Friday to bolster its defense ahead its maiden Champions League campaign. The German club said the 36-year-old Bonucci had joined after arriving on a free transfer from Italian powerhouse Juventus, though it did not disclose the length of the contract. ""It's something special for me to go abroad for the first time in my career,"" Bonucci said in a statement. ""I have the opportunity at Union to continue playing at the highest level and to support the team with my experience in three demanding competitions. I'm really looking forward to this new chapter in my career."" Bonucci, who made more than 500 appearances for Juventus, had one year left on his contract with the Italian club, but he was told before the end of last season that he did not feature in coach Massimiliano Allegri's plans for 2023-24. The player sent a legal notice to the club after being excluded from preseason training. ""I'm sorry it ended like this,"" Allegri said Sunday. ""We've been clear with Leo since February. I've spoken to him several times. Both I and the club said that next year would be a year in which he would have to decide whether to continue elsewhere or retire."" Bonucci previously said he would retire in 2024 once his contract with Juve expired. He also intends to represent Italy at next year's European Championship in Germany. Italy is the defending champion. But Allegri was unwilling to accommodate Bonucci's wishes. The two also had a falling out in 2017 when Bonucci joined rival AC Milan for one season before returning to Juventus. ""When you get to the age of 36, when you've made Juve history, 500 games and you've been a player on the pitch even with a limp ... He has given so much to Juve, Juve has given so much to him. He has to make an important decision for himself, looking at the future and not at one year,"" Allegri said. Union has no problems with age. Christopher Trimmel is 36 and is still captain of the team after joining when it was playing in the second division in 2014. Union was only promoted to the Bundesliga for the first time in 2019. ""In Leonardo we're signing a player with a lot of experience,"" Union sporting director Oliver Ruhnert said. ""He has proven his qualities over many years both nationally and internationally. We're convinced that he will broaden our options in defense and raise the level again with his mentality and flexibility."" Bonucci's signing is another coup for Ruhnert after the arrivals of Germany left back Robin Gosens, former Germany striker Kevin Volland, Ivory Coast forward David Datro Fofana - on loan from Chelsea - and United States midfielder Brenden Aaronson. Union was drawn against Real Madrid, Napoli and Braga for the group stage of the Champions League. Bonucci has made 121 appearances for Italy. He captained the team against Spain in the Nations League semifinals in June.","bonucci, league, the, berlin, ruhnert, allegri, leonardo, massimiliano, volland, oliver, year, champions, union, 500, appearances, contract, kevin, club, italian, brenden"

Bayern Munich's new signing Harry Kane will return to England to face Manchester United in a rematch of the memorable 1999 final, in a group that also includes Copenhagen and Galatasaray. Record 14-time champion Real Madrid plays Napoli, the runaway winner of Serie A last season, Braga and competition debutant Union Berlin, which will use the city's Olympic Stadium for home games. PSG's group already looked like a difficult task for the French champion - which is still looking for an elusive first Champions League title - even before Newcastle was added as the final team. Backed by its majority owner, Saudi Arabia's sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), Newcastle returned to the Champions League after a 20-year gap and shaped as the toughest option in the fourth pot of lowest-ranked teams. Newcastle will take on Qatar-owned PSG which has retained Mbappé in a turbulent offseason that saw Lionel Messi leave for Inter Miami and Neymar sold to Saudi club Al Hilal, which is also majority owned by PIF. ""It's a new era, it's a new style and quality of game, very offensive and this is what we like,"" PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi said, embracing the tough test. ""Everybody wants to play (in the Champions League), so don't complain."" Manchester City, the defending champion, got a favorable draw and will play Leipzig for the third straight season, plus Red Star Belgrade and Young Boys. City has beaten Leipzig 7-0 and 6-3 at home in the past two seasons, and will visit Swiss champion Young Boys on its artificial turf field in Bern. Last season's finalist Inter Milan will play Benfica – which it beat in the quarterfinals – plus Salzburg and Real Sociedad. Barcelona was drawn with Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk and Royal Antwerp, another Champions League debutant which last played in the competition in the old European Cup in 1957. Arsenal's return after six years away will be against Sevilla, PSV Eindhoven and Lens. Feyenoord, the 1970 European Cup winner, was grouped with the team it beat in that final, Celtic, plus Atlético Madrid and Lazio. Teams from 15 different nations were in the draw, including 14 former European champions who have combined to win 48 titles in the competition's 68-year history. Games start Sept. 19 and group-stage play ends Dec. 13. The knockout stage starts in February and reaches the final at Wembley Stadium in London on June 1. The 32 teams will get a share of billion euros ($2.2 billion) in prize money, with each guaranteed at least 15.64 million euros ($17.1 million). Clubs get more depending on their results in the group stage and knockout rounds. UEFA also pays clubs shares from a 600 million euro ($656 million) fund distributed according to their historic record in European competitions, plus a share of their broadcast rights deal in their home country. The eventual champion likely will get about 125 million euros ($135 million) from UEFA.","champions, million, champion, european, the, euros, fund, psg, serie, hilal, khelaifi, league, saudi, group, milan, nasser, madrid, al, sept, competition"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/mission-completed-man-city-beats-inter-milan-to-end-wait-for-first-champions-league-title,Mission completed: Man City beats Inter Milan to end wait for first Champions League title,Associated Press,2023-06-11 10:08:49,"ISTANBUL, JUNE 11 Billions of dollars have been spent and many tears shed on Manchester City's journey to the summit of European soccer. The mission was completed in Istanbul's Ataturk Olimpiyat Stadium on Saturday as the Abu Dhabi-backed club won the Champions League title for the first time and perhaps heralded the start of a new era of dominance in the competition. ""It was written in the stars. It belongs to us,"" said Pep Guardiola after the 1-0 win against Inter Milan, as tears flowed again from the manager, his players and a sea of blue-shirted fans. On this occasion, the emotion was pure ecstasy after so many disappointments on this stage. The victory, courtesy of Rodri's 68th minute goal, has been 15 years in the making since Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan transformed City into one of the richest teams in the world overnight. This was the final frontier for Guardiola's team, which also completed a rare treble of trophies after winning the Premier League title and FA Cup this season. The Champions League had always been a step that seemed out of reach even for a team that has spent more than $1.5 billion on the world's best players and hired probably the greatest coach of his generation in Guardiola. With that psychological barrier broken and the spending power to further improve a team that has already proved too good for the rest, the potential is there to win European club soccer's biggest prize on multiple occasions. Guardiola joked about being ""just 13 Champions Leagues away"" from Real Madrid. ""If you sleep a little bit we will catch you,"" he said. ""But I don't want after one Champions League to disappear, so work harder next season and be in there. There are teams that win the Champions League and after one or two seasons disappear. This is what you have to avoid. Knowing me this is not going to happen. But at the same time I have to admit it, it is a big relief for the club, for the institution, for everyone to have this trophy. Because now, finally, they don't have to ask me if we are going to win the Champions League or not."" This trophy will also strengthen the case to declare Guardiola the greatest coach ever as he collected his third Champions League title and 30th major piece of silverware. It was his second treble of trophies, having emulated the feat he achieved with Barcelona in 2009. City became just the second English club to complete a sweep of the three biggest trophies after Manchester United did it in 1999. There were questions about whether Guardiola could ever win the Champions League again without the aid of Lionel Messi, who was the inspiration of his Barcelona team that was twice crowned champions of Europe. Those questions have now been answered, yet for all the talk of City's superiority leading up to the game, it was won by the finest of margins through Rodri's strike. Even after that goal, Inter had great chances to force extra time. The best one fell to substitute Romelu Lukaku in the 89th minute, but he headed straight at Ederson from about four meters (yards) out. Federico Dimarco hit the bar from close range almost immediately after Rodri's goal and then turned the rebound against the legs of Lukaku. ""We didn't deserve to lose,"" said Inter coach Simone Inzaghi. ""We played against a top team, but even Inter played a great final. ""Manchester City has deserved the Champions League considering what it has done in the past years. But tonight it played against a great Inter which cornered them."" City found a way through on a night when it was far from its best and showed few examples of the flowing play that saw it blow away Bayern Munich and Real Madrid on the way to the final. ""Today we made history,"" City captain Ilkay Gundogan said. ""We knew everyone was talking about the treble. The pressure was there but this team is built to handle the pressure in the best possible way."" Gundogan lifted the trophy as an explosion of gold ticker tape was set off and Queen's ""We are the Champions"" rang out around the stadium. Sheikh Mansour was in attendance to see the crowning moment, watching his team in person for only the second time since buying the club in 2008. ""One of the main reasons why this club became what we are is because people from Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mansour, take over the club,"" Guardiola said. ""Without that we would not be here. They are the most important people. ... They support me unconditionally in the defeats in this competition. At many clubs when that happens you are sacked."" The victory ended Guardiola's wait to win the trophy for the first time since 2011 and came despite losing inspirational midfielder Kevin De Bruyne to an injury in the first half. The club's fans likely feared the worst when he went down holding his right leg. It was as if history was repeating itself after injury had also forced the Belgium international off when City lost to Chelsea in its only other Champions League final in 2021. But the decisive moment came when Rodri collected Bernardo Silva's cutback and fired through a crowded penalty box. The relief was unmistakable as he raced towards City's fans and slid on his knees in celebration. Inter pressed for an equalizer. City held on. Europe had been conquered. A mission that began 15 years ago, completed.","the, champions, league, club, mansour, rodri, istanbul, city, inter, treble, ataturk, inzaghi, olimpiyat, nahyan, manchester, bernardo, zayed, team, guardiola, this"

Add the FA Cup, after a 2-1 win over great rival Manchester United on Saturday, to its latest Premier League title. Now only a first ever Champions League title stands between City and immortality in English soccer. ""We're in a position,"" City manager Pep Guardiola said, ""that we'll probably never be in again."" Ilkay Gundogan scored two goals - the first inside 13 seconds, for the quickest in 142 years of FA Cup finals - to lead City to a 16th trophy since 2011 in what is looking like the crowning season in the tenure of Abu Dhabi's ruling family. If the Germany midfielder's opener, a perfectly executed volley from the edge of area, was probably his best goal of his seven years at City, his 51st-minute winner at Wembley Stadium might be one of his scrappiest. This time it was a volley with his left foot after being picked out by Kevin De Bruyne's free kick from the right wing. The ball bobbled between two United defenders and squirmed past goalkeeper David De Gea, who might have been slightly unsighted but should have done better. United was looking to protect its proud status as the only team to win the league-FA Cup-European Cup treble, in 1999, and equalized against the run of play through a penalty by Bruno Fernandes in the 33rd minute. Late pressure saw United hit the crossbar through Raphael Varane. The team needs a favor from Inter Milan in the Champions League final in Istanbul next Saturday to thwart's City's treble bid. ""What a privilege - we are one game away,"" Guardiola said. City's class of 2023 became the 13th team in English soccer history to clinch a league-and-FA Cup double. It has happened twice under Guardiola, who has won 13 trophies in his seven years at the club and 34 in his managerial career. The latest haul of titles has come in the same season the club was charged by the Premier League with more than 100 breaches of financial rules. City denies the charges and the players certainly weren't thinking of them after the final whistle blew as they ran from the halfway line and jumped for joy in front of their fans waving blue and white flags. Right at the heart of the celebrations was Gundogan, who - as it stands - will be leaving City after the Champions League final because he is out of contract. He would depart as a club great and a FA Cup record-breaker. The opening goal was timed by British broadcaster BBC at 12.91 seconds and came after Gundogan, City's captain, took the kickoff himself. He passed the ball back to goalkeeper Stefan Ortega, who booted it forward for Erling Haaland to flick on. United defender Victor Lindelof could only partially clear to Gundogan, who volleyed in right-footed from 20 meters. ""We aimed for that, to aim for Erling and to try to get the second ball quick,"" Gundogan said. The goal jolted United, which was outplayed until a controversial decision to award a penalty against Jack Grealish for handball as he raised his arms while jumping to block a header into the box by United defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Play continued and there were few on-field appeals by United's players, but the incident was reviewed by VAR and a penalty was awarded after the referee looked at the pitchside monitor. Fernandes sauntered up to the ball and sent Ortega the wrong way. Gundogan ultimately had the final say, just like he did in City's final game of last season when he scored two late goals to complete a turnaround from 2-0 down against Aston Villa and clinch the Premier League with a 3-2 win. United was looking to clinch a double of domestic trophies in Erik ten Hag's first year in charge, having won the League Cup in February, but more importantly ensure its class of 1999's legacy was preserved. The 142nd FA Cup final - the first between the two Manchester clubs - was largely one-sided, though, and Ten Hag conceded his team was beaten by ""the best team in the world."" United's players stayed on the field and watched as City walked up the steps to collect their winners' medals from Prince William. ""You have to feel it in your stomach,"" Ten Hag said. ""It has to be the fuel."" All roads lead to Istanbul as Guardiola and City chase another piece of history. ""We have to win the Champions League,"" he said, ""to be recognized how the team deserves to be recognized.""","fa, the, cup, league, treble, city, united, manchester, ortega, stefan, lindelof, gea, team, ten, bissaka, wan, bruyne, hag, dhabi, volley"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/man-city-celebrates-premier-league-title-at-home-with-fans-now-targets-treble,"Man City celebrates Premier League title at home with fans, now targets treble",Associated Press,2023-05-22 23:34:45,"MANCHESTER, MAY 22 With an explosion of blue-and-white ticker tape, Manchester City's Premier League title celebrations erupted. That's three league titles in a row, five out of six and who knows how many more for a team that keeps on reaching new heights? ""They've set a benchmark that has pulled them apart,"" Chelsea manager Frank Lampard said after his team was beaten 1-0 by the newly crowned champions on Sunday. ""I think they're outstanding ... that's why they are on for a possible treble."" The first leg of that three-pronged trophy pursuit is complete, with the finals of the FA Cup and Champions League still to come. The concern for Manchester United and Inter Milan in those respective finals is that this City team only appears to be getting stronger as the season nears a spectacular climax for Pep Guardiola. ""To be considered one of the greatest teams we have to win Europe, win the Champions League,"" the City manager said. Victory against Chelsea extended City's unbeaten run to 24 games in all competitions. And even with Erling Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne and a host of star players named on the bench against Chelsea, a 12th straight win in the league was secured. It was a run that proved too much for an Arsenal team that had led the way for much of the season, but buckled on the final stretch. Nobody at City appears to be tiring of that winning feeling. Certainly not Guardiola, who has now won 11 league titles in 14 seasons of management, spanning Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City. Not the players either, who answered their coach's challenge earlier in the season by proving they had not lost their edge and sang ""We Are The Champions"" in the locker room. And not the supporters, who flooded the field after the final whistle at Etihad Stadium, letting off canisters of blue smoke and celebrating joyously as a period of unprecedented success for their beloved team goes on. While this latest title - a seventh under the ownership of Abu Dhabi's ruling family - was duly relished, the overriding feeling within the stadium was about what comes next. One banner, carried onto the field by fans, read: ""The treble is on"" and Kyle Walker spoke of the team's determination to ""create history."" In that sense, it would feel like an underwhelming end to the campaign if City failed to add to the league title. That is a natural consequence of Guardiola's dominance and why the pressure on him grows to finally conquer Europe with this team. For City's English rivals, however, the title remains a dream and Arsenal - like Liverpool in recent years - has learned the hard way just how painful it can be to go head-to-head with Guardiola. In the end, Mikel Arteta's side fell away all too easily, winning just two of its last eight games. But for much of the season, it felt like Arsenal would hold on for a first title in 19 years. It might not get a better chance to beat City than this year when Guardiola's players struggled for consistency before going on a relentless march from February. Even then, Arsenal led the table by eight points as recently as April 7, but still couldn't hold off City's charge. ""Arsenal brought us to our limits, otherwise (we) would not win these 12 games in a row,"" Guardiola said. ""We didn't give up and they felt that we were there."" It is possible to imagine City getting stronger next season, with 52-goal Haaland more settled in the team and the league. New signings are also likely to come in during the off-season and Guardiola's new three-man defensive system may also be more refined after changing his formation during this campaign. That is for the future. On Sunday it was all about City's latest party, but Guardiola hopes the end of season celebrations have only just begun. LEEDS NEARS RELEGATION The Sam Allardyce experiment looks destined to fail after Leeds' 3-1 loss at West Ham on Sunday pushed it to the brink of relegation. Leeds needs to win against Tottenham on the last day of the season and hope that other results go its way to avoid the drop. Rodrigo opened the scoring at London Stadium, but goals from Declan Rice, Jarrod Bowen and Manuel Lanzini consigned Leeds to a latest defeat. Allardyce was tasked with the job of ensuring survival at the start of May, but has only picked up one point in his three games in charge. ""It was always going to be a difficult task,"" the 68-year-old former England coach said. ""Lots of people said I'm mad for taking it. I'm not mad. I just love football and Leeds United was too big a job to turn down for me, however short it was."" BRIGHTON INTO EUROPE Roberto de Zerbi might be one of the most in-demand coaches around this summer - but he says he has his sights set on leading Brighton into Europe next season. ""The club, the players, me, my staff, and the fans, they have to organize their passports to travel in Europe next year because we have to grow together,"" he said after a 3-1 win against relegated Southampton on Sunday. Few could have predicted such a successful season for Brighton after manager Graham Potter left for Chelsea in September. But De Zerbi has taken the club to new levels after leading it to Europe for the first time in its history. That was secured against Southampton, with Evan Ferguson scoring twice in the first half to set up the win. Mohamed Elyounoussi pulled one back after the break, but Pascal Gross' goal sealed a 3-1 victory. Brighton can't now finish lower than seventh - in the Europa Conference League spot - though a sixth-place finish and a Europa League berth are all but mathematically guaranteed.","league, the, leeds, city, season, champions, guardiola, europa, title, team, manchester, treble, lampard, allardyce, graham, players, potter, pascal, stadium, dhabi"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/sweet-sixteen-liverpools-lead-in-premier-league-grows-to-16-points-as-ailing-man-city-loses-again,Sweet Sixteen: Liverpool's lead in Premier League grows to 16 points as ailing Man City loses again,Associated Press,2025-03-09 22:38:59,"LONDON, MARCH 9 Liverpool's lead in the Premier League has grown to 16 points. Mohamed Salah's lead in the Golden Boot contest is up to seven goals. Both races are turning into a procession after Salah converted two second-half penalties for his 26th and 27th goals of the campaign to clinch a 3-1 win for Liverpool at home to last-placed Southampton on Saturday. It seems a matter of when, not if, Liverpool secures its record-tying 20th English top-flight championship, even if Arsenal - way back in second place - has two games in hand. Liverpool's players have nine games left but surely won't need all of them to seal the title. Maybe a more staggering statistic is that Manchester City, the winner of the last four titles, is now 23 points behind Liverpool after a 1-0 loss at third-placed Nottingham Forest, whose 83rd-minute winner came from Callum Hudson-Odoi. City is in fourth place, at least for overnight, and has a fight on its hands just to finish in the top five, which should be enough to qualify for the Champions League this season. Only five points separate City from Fulham in 10th place. Erling Haaland had a quiet match and - stuck on 20 goals - is now struggling to be the league's top scorer for the third straight season. Instead, it's Salah heading for the Golden Boot, which he won outright in 2017-18 and shared in the 2018-19 and 2021-22 seasons, and is now up to 184 goals in the Premier League - tied with Man City great Sergio Aguero at No. 5 on the all-time list. Aguero and Salah are the top-scoring foreign players since the Premier League was founded in 1992. Liverpool not holding back ahead of PSG For Liverpool, the meeting with Southampton came in the middle of two matches in a six-day span against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League's last 16. Liverpool holds a 1-0 lead after the first leg in Paris on Wednesday and manager Arne Slot opted against mass rotation ahead of the return match on Tuesday. Indeed, Salah played the whole match. Darwin Nunez started after setting up Harvey Elliott's winner in the French capital and scored himself in the 51st minute, canceling out Will Smallbone's shock opener for Southampton in first-half stoppage time. Nunez then was fouled for the first penalty slotted home by Salah in the 54th, before the Egypt star notched his second in the 88th after a handball. ""The manager, his head was going for us but it's something you need sometimes,"" Salah said of Slot's halftime reaction. ""Because the first half it was sloppy and we were slow."" Southampton stayed 13 points from safety and looks destined for an immediate return to the Championship. Forest on course for Champions League Forest's improbable bid for Champions League qualification was strengthened by beating City, whose goalkeeper Ederson Moraes was beaten at his near post by Hudson-Odoi's shot late in a tight game at the City Ground. A few minutes earlier, Ederson had tipped a curling strike by Hudson-Odoi onto the post. ""I knew I'd get another chance and that one went in, so I'm buzzing,"" Hudson-Odoi said. Forest was battling relegation last season and finished 59 points behind City. Now it is four points ahead of the soon-to-be-deposed champions and has 10 games remaining as the club looks to get back into Europe's top competition, which Forest famously won in 1979 and '80 under Brian Clough. City has lost three of its last five league games, to the current top three of Liverpool, Arsenal and now Forest. ""Every season the Premier League gets better and better,"" Guardiola said. ""We have 10 finals (to go)."" Narrow wins for Brighton and Villa Joao Pedro converted a penalty in the eighth minute of stoppage time to earn Brighton a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Fulham and lift his team to sixth place - level on points with fifth-placed Chelsea. Since losing 7-0 at Forest on Feb. 1, Brighton has won six straight games in all competitions - including four in the league. Aston Villa is a point behind in seventh place after winning 1-0 at Brentford, with Ollie Watkins scoring from a deflected shot in the 49th against his former club. The England striker, who was jeered throughout by the home fans, has six goals in his last six appearances against Brentford. Crystal Palace beat Ipswich 1-0 thanks to Ismaila Sarr's 82nd-minute goal, while fourth-from-last Wolverhampton pushed six points clear of the relegation zone after drawing 1-1 with Everton in the late game.","league, the, champions, odoi, hudson, minute, forest, goals, slot, games, moraes, aguero, smallbone, elliott, ismaila, place, sarr, sergio, boot, six"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/liverpool-increases-lead-atop-premier-league-as-arsenal-drops-more-points,Liverpool increases lead atop Premier League as Arsenal drops more points,Associated Press,2025-02-27 17:54:27,"MANCHESTER, FEBRUARY 27 It feels like a matter of when, not if, Liverpool seals a record-equaling 20th English league title. The gap at the top of the Premier League was extended to 13 points on Wednesday after a 2-0 victory over Newcastle. Liverpool took full advantage as second-place Arsenal dropped more points in a 0-0 draw with Nottingham Forest. Dominik Szoboszlai scored in the 11th minute and Alexis Mac Allister netted just past the hour mark at Anfield to secure a 20th league win of the season from 28 games. Title success would see Liverpool equal Manchester United's record haul. A goalless draw with Forest highlighted Arsenal's problems amid an injury crisis in attack, with the Londoners failing to score for the third time in four games. Manchester City moved back up to fourth after Erling Haaland returned from a knee injury and scored in a 1-0 win at Tottenham. Ten-man Manchester United was given a scare by relegation-fighting Ipswich. Trailing inside four minutes at Old Trafford after Jaden Philogene's early goal, United bounced back to win 3-2, despite Patrick Dorgu's red card in the 43rd. Title in sight It all seems so easy for Liverpool right now. With its rivals faltering one by one, the Merseyside club keeps edging closer to the title. Not even the absence of coach Arne Slot from the sideline after he was handed a two-match suspension could halt his team's progress. Against a Newcastle team that was without injured star striker Alexander Isak, Liverpool eased to victory at Anfield. Szoboszlai scored for the second time in as many games - firing low from inside the box in the 11th. Newcastle mounted little threat and Mac Allister put the game beyond doubt in the 63rd following Mohamed Salah's assist. The teams will meet again at Wembley next month in the final of the English League Cup when Liverpool could seal the first leg of a potential treble. Newcastle, meanwhile, is aiming to end a 70-year wait for a major domestic trophy. Arsenal drought A lack of spending in the January transfer window is proving to be a costly mistake for Arsenal. How Arteta could do with some fresh attacking options right now with his team looking desperately blunt in front of goal. Injuries to Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli have undermined Arsenal's title challenge, while on-loan Raheem Sterling has scored just once in 21 appearances this term. Arsenal was linked with a move for Aston Villa's OIlie Watkins at the end of the window, but ended up empty-handed. And it looks like that will be the case in terms of its title pursuit after the draw with Forest saw it slip further adrift of Liverpool. ""We played well and were dominant through the whole games,"" Arsenal's Leandro Trossard said. ""But goals happen in the boxes. We defended well but up top we need to try and create more."" Haaland returns Haaland is back and City is back to winning ways. In the Norwegian's absence, City crashed out of the Champions League to Real Madrid last week and then fell to defeat to Liverpool. While the title looks well beyond Pep Guardiola's team, the priority will be to secure Champions League qualification. City can still win a trophy in the form of the FA Cup as well. Victory at Tottenham saw the four-time defending champion move a point ahead of fifth-place Chelsea and one behind Forest in third. Haaland's goal in the 12th was his 28th of the season in all competitions. Unconvincing United Against an Ipswich team that is still waiting for a first league win in 2025, United went behind early on, had to rely on an own goal and went down to 10-men before taking all three points. In a week when more job cuts were announced at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim's team gave the home crowd something to cheer with only a third win at home in the league since Dec. 1. ""The moment is what it is, we have been suffering, we haven't been at our best. We scored from two set pieces, but we were in complete control of the game,"" United captain Bruno Fernandes said. A Sam Morsy own goal leveled the game after Philogene's opener and Matthijs de Ligt gave United the lead. Dorgu was sent off in the 43rd and in first-half stoppage time Philogene scored his second. Harry Maguire scored United's winner just after the break. United moved up to 14th - ahead of Everton, which drew 1-1 at Brentford.","league, the, arsenal, manchester, philogene, title, haaland, united, dorgu, jaden, morsy, oilie, team, leandro, trossard, goal, allister, watkins, patrick, mac"

But Arne Slot's team had to hold off a fightback from relegation-threatened Wolves at Anfield, which included a brilliant long-range goal from Matheus Cunha. First-half strikes from Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah secured the win for Liverpool and ensured it maintained its advantage over second-placed Arsenal. Liverpool failed to register a single shot on target after the break as Wolves dominated the chances. Diaz bundled the ball over the line from close range in the 15th minute to give the home team the lead. And Salah doubled the advantage from the penalty spot in the 37th after Diaz was brought down. It was the Egypt international's 28th goal of an outstanding season. But if the home crowd was expecting a routine victory against Wolves, it was anything but. Cunha's drag-back and curled finish from around 20 yards (meters) in the 67th came after a sustained period of pressure from the visitors. Before that Marshall Munetsi was denied when through on goal - it took a crucial block in front of goal from Jarell Quansah to prevent him from converting late on.

Mikel Arteta's team took advantage of Liverpool's draw with Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, with Leandro Trossard firing the winner in the north London derby at the Emirates Stadium. ""Everybody knows you need to win these games, the fans are buzzing and it's a great night for us,"" Trossard said. ""It's an amazing feeling, especially to get the winner as well, it had to come and now we need to look forward."" Arsenal was runner-up to Manchester City in the last two seasons and is in contention for the title again this year. But it was given a fright by Spurs when Son Heung-min opened the scoring for the visitors in the 25th minute. A Dominic Solanke own goal when trying to defend a corner leveled the game in the 40th and Trossard struck low from just inside the box four minutes later to put Arsenal ahead. Liverpool still has a game in hand on second-place Arsenal but has dropped points by drawing its last two league matches and is on a run of just one win in four in all competitions. That was against fourth-division Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup. Arsenal bounced back quickly after the disappointment of being knocked out of the FA Cup by Manchester United on penalties and opened up a two-point lead over Forest in third. ""Less than 72 hours ago we played 120 minutes in another competition that we went out of - that is not easy psychologically. So the way we performed and played today was exceptional,"" Arteta said. Tottenham has won just one of its last nine games in the league. ""The losses hurt me but they aren't acceptable. We have had too many losses this year and too many games that have got away from us. That needs to stop,"" head coach Ange Postecoglou said. Isak on target again Alexander Isak scored for the eighth straight league game to propel Newcastle into the top four. The Sweden international struck twice in a 3-0 victory over Wolverhampton to take his season total to 17 in all competitions. He became the fourth player to score in eight consecutive games in the Premier League, following Ruud van Nistelrooy, Jamie Vardy and Daniel Sturridge. Vardy scored a league record 11-straight games. ""Like most strikers, Isak wants to practice his finishing. It is an art form. He is there after training every day trying to do more,"" Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said. Isak's form has pushed Newcastle into Champions League contention. He's scored 12 in his last 10 games in all competitions and Newcastle is on a nine-match winning streak. Isak opened the scoring in the 34th against relegation-threatened Wolverhampton at St James' Park. He got his second in the 57th and Anthony maintained his own scoring form with his fourth goal in successive games. Howe's team is now one point ahead of fifth-place Chelsea. Unhappy homecoming for Moyes David Moyes' return to Everton didn't get off to the start he wanted after a 1-0 loss to Aston Villa. In his second spell at the Merseyside club, Moyes took charge of his 519th game as Everton manager and was welcomed by the Goodison Park crowd. But he couldn't inspire his relegation-threatened team to victory as Ollie Watkins' goal six minutes into the second half sealed Villa's win. Everton is 16th in the standings and a point above the bottom three. Moyes' immediate priority is to find goals from somewhere. Everton has failed to score in nine of its last 11 league games. Leicester slumping The hiring of Ruud van Nistelrooy hasn't paid off for Leicester yet. A 2-0 loss at home to Crystal Palace leaves the 2016 champion second from bottom of the standings and without a league win since Van Nistelrooy's first game in charge at the start of December. It's now six straight defeats in the league, with Jean-Philippe Mateta and Marc Guehi scoring for Palace in the second half at the King Power Stadium. ""Six without a win is not good enough. You can't keep talking about performances. We need to win and that needs to happen soon,"" Van Nistelrooy said. United drops Manchester United doesn't play until Thursday, but Palace's win saw the record 20-time champion slip to 15th in the standings.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/man-city-turns-corner-with-successive-wins-in-premier-league-as-arsenal-and-chelsea-drop-points,Man City turns corner with successive wins in Premier League as Arsenal and Chelsea drop points,Associated Press,2025-01-05 21:21:39,"LONDON, JANUARY 5 Erling Haaland and Manchester City might just be turning the corner after the team's worst run of results under Pep Guardiola. Haaland scored twice in a 4-1 win over West Ham on Saturday as City secured back-to-back victories in the Premier League for the first time since late October, when a shocking and unthinkable six-week meltdown began. In that time, the defending champions played nine league games and won just once, dropping them out of the Champions League qualification spots and raising questions about Guardiola's stomach for a rebuild. Now, City can hope for better times ahead - especially after making up ground on second-placed Arsenal and fourth-placed Chelsea after they both dropped points in draws at Brighton and Crystal Palace, respectively, on Saturday. Still, Guardiola wasn't getting carried away. ""I'm very pleased for the result,"" he said, ""but you cannot ask me if the old City is back. If you saw the game, we are not."" However, while the 2-0 win at Leicester last weekend was unconvincing, there were better signs against West Ham - at least in attack with Haaland looking sharp. The Norway striker headed in Savinho's cross to make it 2-0 in the 42nd minute and chipped the goalkeeper for 3-0 in the 55th after running onto another pass from Savinho. Either side, there was an own-goal and a strike from Phil Foden before Niclas Fullkrug pulled one back for West Ham. ""We are still not like we were, for different reasons,"" Guardiola said. ""The result will help. We struggle but it is a release."" City stayed in sixth. Good day for Liverpool It was a good day for Liverpool - and the league leader didn't even play. Arsenal was held to 1-1 at Brighton, which equalized from the penalty spot through Joao Pedro, and missed the chance to trim the gap to Liverpool to three points. Ethan Nwaneri put Arsenal ahead and, at age 17, became only the sixth player under 18 to score multiple Premier League goals. Brighton's penalty was awarded after Arsenal defender William Saliba was adjudged to have clashed heads with Pedro as they challenged for a bouncing ball. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was disappointed with the call, saying: ""I have never seen a decision like this in my career. I asked the boys if they have and nobody has seen it before."" Chelsea's winless run in the league extended to four matches after drawing at Palace 1-1. Jean-Philippe Mateta equalized in the 82nd for Palace, cancelling out Cole Palmer's opener. Chelsea has drawn twice and lost twice since Dec. 22, damaging a title bid that had been picking up some steam - even if manager Enzo Maresca never accepted his team was a realistic challenger. ""We still created so many chances in front of goal but it's about getting the end product,"" Chelsea winger Jadon Sancho said. ""We're still playing the same football, we are still giving 100%. This is what happens in football."" Liverpool leads Arsenal by five points and Chelsea by nine, and has two games in hand over both rivals. The first comes at home to Manchester United on Sunday. In-form Isak Alexander Isak scored in a seventh straight Premier League game to earn Newcastle a 2-1 win at injury-hit Tottenham. The Sweden striker grabbed the 38th-minute winner and there was a hint of fortune about it, with Tottenham defender Radu Drăgușin getting the slightest of touches on a cross and deflecting the ball onto the foot of Isak. The ball dribbled into the net for Isak's 13th goal of the season, and ninth in his past seven games. Thomas Tuchel was in the stands in his first scouting mission in his role as the recently hired England coach. Two players likely to be in his first squad, to be announced in March for World Cup qualifiers, got on the score sheet in the opening six minutes. Dominic Solanke headed Tottenham ahead in the fourth minute, and Anthony Gordon equalized. It was a fifth straight win for fifth-placed Newcastle, while Tottenham stayed in the bottom half of the standings with just one point from its last four games. Southampton thrashed A change in manager hasn't helped Southampton. The league's last-placed team was beaten by Brentford 5-0 at home for a third straight defeat under Ivan Juric, who was hired on Dec. 21 to replace the fired Russell Martin. Southampton has one point from four games under Juric and just six points overall. Bryan Mbeumo scored two of Brentford's goals and has 13 for the season in the league. It was Brentford's biggest ever win in the Premier League. Aston Villa beat Leicester 2-1, while Bournemouth won at home to Everton 1-0 and was eight games unbeaten - a club record in its time in the Premier League.","league, the, games, premier, isak, arsenal, brentford, placed, drăgușin, radu, minute, chelsea, jadon, maresca, sancho, win, russell, saliba, champions, palmer"

Arsenal failed to take advantage. A 0-0 draw at home to lowly Everton left third-placed Arsenal still six points behind Liverpool and will go down as a big opportunity missed. Undermined by Andy Robertson's 17th-minute red card, Liverpool did well to earn a point at Anfield - but could have pulled off an unlikely win after sustained late pressure following Diogo Jota's equalizer in the 86th. ""I don't think I could've asked for more from my players,"" Liverpool manager Arne Slot said. Fulham led for the first time after Andreas Pereira's 11th-minute volley deflected into the net off Robertson, who was sent off six minutes later for bringing down Harry Wilson as the last man and denying a goal-scoring opportunity. Cody Gakpo leveled just after halftime by heading in a cross from Mohamed Salah, who registered his 100th assist for Liverpool in all competitions. Substitute Rodrigo Muniz's flick put Fulham back ahead in the 76th, only for Jota to run onto Darwin Nunez's pass, turn his marker and drive home a finish from the edge of the area. Liverpool drew at Newcastle 3-3 in its last league game. Arsenal has also drawn two games in a row, after a 1-1 at Fulham last weekend, and hasn't scored from open play in its last three league matches. Second-placed Chelsea hosts Brentford on Sunday and can move two points behind Liverpool with a win. O'Neil on the brink Wolverhampton manager Gary O'Neil will do well to survive this latest damaging defeat. Ipswich beat Wolves 2-1 thanks to Jack Taylor's winner in the fourth minute of stoppage time in a match between teams in the relegation zone, though only one of the coaches came into it under real pressure. O'Neil has led Wolves to only two victories in the league this season, and three since March. The slide under O'Neil began at the end of last season when Wolves won just one of their last 10 league games after being knocked out of the FA Cup in the quarterfinals by second-tier Coventry. On Monday, after losing at West Ham 2-1, O'Neil expressed his disappointment at losing the connection with Wolves' fans and also aimed some criticism at the club's owners for sanctioning the sale of many of its top players over the last two years. There were boos at halftime and fulltime at Molineux, with Wolves staying in next-to-last place and dropping three points behind third-to-last Ipswich. There was also some post-match chaos when Wolves players and staff argued between themselves and Ipswich players on the field. Amid it all, Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri was shown a second yellow card. Ruud awakening Ruud van Nistelrooy fell to his first loss with Leicester - and it was a big one. Leicester was thrashed 4-0 at Newcastle, for which Jacob Murphy scored twice and Alexander Isak nodded in his seventh goal of the campaign. Bruno Guimaraes netted the other goal. Van Nistelrooy, the former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker, was brought in to replace the fired Steve Cooper and earned a win and a draw - both at home - in his first two games in charge. Wonder save Emi Martinez's wonder save for Aston Villa proved to be in vain. In the 60th minute, the Argentina international was standing slightly off his line as a header by Nottingham Forest's Nicolas Dominguez went past him. Martinez stuck out his left hand behind him and somehow managed to drop the ball down onto the ground and scoop it away from off the line in the same motion. Villa went ahead three minutes later through Jhon Duran, only for goals by Nikola Milenković in the 87th and Anthony Elanga in the third minute of stoppage time to clinch a 2-1 win for Forest. Forest moved up to fourth place above Manchester City, which hosts Manchester United in the derby on Sunday.","the, minute, league, last, wolves, andreas, ait, van, rayan, robertson, nouri, dominguez, muniz, cooper, gary, jota, pereira, emi, neil, nistelrooy"

In a wild London derby, Chelsea conceded twice in the opening 11 minutes before recovering brilliantly for a 4-3 win at Tottenham to move four points behind Liverpool on Sunday. Cole Palmer sealed the comeback with an impudent ""Panenka"" penalty - one of his two converted spot kicks in the match. Liverpool, the league leader, was inactive this round after a storm forced the postponement of the Merseyside derby against Everton on Saturday. It gave Chelsea and Arsenal, Liverpool's closest challengers, an opportunity to apply some pressure. Chelsea did so. Arsenal couldn't, however, after only drawing 1-1 with Fulham, despite adding to its lengthy list of goals from corners. Maresca has been insisting Chelsea's youthful squad shouldn't be considered a contender to win the league this season. His players are too young and inexperienced, he maintains. Few will accept that now. After an unprecedented spending spree on players of over $1.3 billion over the last five transfer windows, Chelsea finally has a consistent team - led by Palmer on the field and with impressive direction from Maresca off it. The Blues' only losses in the league have been to Manchester City - in the opening round, way before the champion's recent meltdown - and Liverpool. They've won their last four league games, scoring 14 goals in the process. Still, Chelsea's players were towing Maresca's line. ""We still have so much to improve on,"" Chelsea defender Levi Colwill said. ""Like the gaffer (boss) said, when we are ready to push for a title we won't be 2-0 down in the first 10 (minutes). That's the levels and that's what we're going to keep working on."" Arsenal, meanwhile, is getting most of its goals from set pieces. William Saliba - one of two scorers from corners in the 2-0 win over Manchester United on Wednesday - repeated the trick in the 52nd minute against Fulham to earn his team a point at Craven Cottage. Raul Jimenez put Fulham ahead in the 11th. Arsenal trimmed the gap to Liverpool to six points but this will go down as a wasted opportunity. Bukayo Saka had what looked like being a winning goal for Arsenal ruled out for offside against fellow winger Gabriel Martinelli in the buildup in the 88th. PENALTY RECORD Palmer has set a record by scoring each of the first 12 penalties he has taken in the Premier League. According to the league's statistics supplier Opta, it's the best 100% record in the competition - overtaking former Man City midfielder Yaya Touré. Since joining Chelsea in the summer of 2023, Palmer has 33 goals and 17 assists in 48 games. Only Erling Haaland for City (39 games), Andy Cole for Newcastle (43 games), and Mo Salah for Liverpool (46 games) have got to 50 goal involvements quicker. LATE GOALS Bournemouth and Leicester left it very late to pick up points from losing positions. Jamie Vardy scored in the 86th and set up another goal for Bobby De Cordova-Reid in the first minute of stoppage time as Leicester staged a late recovery to draw 2-2 at home to Brighton in Ruud van Nistelrooy's second match in charge. He won his first, against West Ham, 3-1 on Tuesday. Tariq Lamptey and Yankuba Minteh had given Brighton its two-goal cushion. Bournemouth scored in the 87th, and again in the fifth minute of added-on time through Dango Ouattara, to win 2-1 at Ipswich, which stayed in the relegation zone with just one victory this season. Conor Chaplin put Ipswich ahead in the 21st.","league, the, chelsea, goals, games, yaya, touré, levi, colwill, maresca, premier, palmer, nistelrooy, goal, martinelli, cole, record, penalty, ruud, gabriel"

It was a 10th victory in 12 league games for Liverpool, which took advantage of defending champion Manchester City's stunning third straight league loss - 4-0 at home to Tottenham on Saturday - and fifth in a row in all competitions. Liverpool was trailing 2-1 when Salah equalized in the 65th after running onto a long pass forward from Ryan Gravenberch. The Egypt forward then converted a penalty in the 83rd after a handball by Yukinari Sugawara.

France and Israel are playing in a UEFA Nations League match on Thursday that French President Emmanuel Macron will attend, the Elysee presidential palace said. Israel's National Security Council, in a statement Sunday, warned citizens abroad to avoid sports and cultural events, specifically the match in Paris, and be careful of violent attacks ""under the pretense of demonstrations."" ""There's a context, tensions that make that match a high-risk event for us,"" Paris police chief Laurent Nuñez said on French news broadcaster BFM TV, adding authorities ""won't tolerate"" any violence. Nuñez said that 2,500 police officers would be deployed around the Stade de France stadium, north of the French capital, in addition to 1,500 others in Paris and on public transportation. ""There will be an anti-terrorist security perimeter around the stadium,"" Nuñez said. Security checks will be ""reinforced,"" he added, including with systematic pat-downs and bag searches. Nuñez said that French organizers have been in contact with Israeli authorities and security forces in order to prepare for the match. Israeli fans were assaulted last week after a soccer game in Amsterdam by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people, according to Dutch authorities. Five people were treated at hospitals and dozens were arrested after the attacks, which were condemned as antisemitic by authorities in Amsterdam, Israel and across Europe. Before the game, large crowds of supporters of the Israeli team could be seen on video chanting anti-Arab slogans as they headed to the stadium, escorted by police. On Sunday, Dutch police detained several people for taking part in a demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed following the violence targeting Israeli fans, a local broadcaster reported. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau confirmed Friday that the France-Israel match would go ahead as planned. ""I think that for a symbolic reason we must not yield, we must not give up,"" he said, noting that sports fans from around the world came together for the Paris Olympics this year to celebrate the ""universal values"" of sports. Macron's expected attendance not only is a show of support for the French team, but also aims as sending ""a message of fraternity and solidarity following the intolerable antisemitic acts that followed the match in Amsterdam,"" an official in Macron's entourage said. The official couldn't be named in line with the Elysee's customary practices.","french, macron, paris, france, security, match, israel, nuñez, laurent, retailleau, bfm, elysee, officers, israeli, soccer, police, the, amsterdam, emmanuel, violence"

The police said in a post on X that they have started a major investigation into multiple violent incidents. The post did not provide further details about those injured or detained in Thursday night's violence. Earlier, a statement issued by the Dutch capital's municipality, police and prosecution office said that the night following the Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv ""was very turbulent with several incidents of violence aimed at Maccabi supporters."" AMSTERDAM: Rioters ""actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them"" after a soccer match, Amsterdam authorities said Friday as Israel announced it was sending planes to the Dutch capital to fly fans home. An unknown number of Israeli supporters were injured in the Thursday night violence that was condemned by the leaders of both the Netherlands and Israel as antisemitic. A statement issued by the Dutch capital's municipality, police and prosecution office said that the night following the Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv ""was very turbulent with several incidents of violence aimed at Maccabi supporters."" There was no immediate word on the number of injured or arrests and it was not immediately clear when and where violence erupted after the match. ""In several places in the city, supporters were attacked. The police had to intervene several times, protect Israeli supporters and escort them to hotels. Despite the massive police presence in the city, Israeli supporters have been injured,"" the Amsterdam statement said. ""This outburst of violence toward Israeli supporters is unacceptable and cannot be defended in any way. There is no excuse for the antisemitic behavior exhibited last night by rioters who actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them,"" it added. Authorities said extra police would patrol the city in coming days and security will be beefed up at Jewish institutions in the city that has a large Jewish community and was home to Jewish World War II diarist Anne Frank and her family as they hid from Nazi occupiers. The violence erupted despite a ban on a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the soccer stadium imposed by Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema, who had feared that clashes would break out between protesters and supporters of the Israeli soccer club. There were also incidents involving fans ahead of the match. Dutch broadcaster NOS reported that a Palestinian flag was ripped off a building in the center of the city and riot police blocked pro-Palestinian supporters trying to march toward the Johan Cruyff Arena stadium where the match was being played. Israel ordered that two planes be sent to the Dutch capital to bring the Israelis home. A statement from Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that ""the harsh pictures of the assault on our citizens in Amsterdam will not be overlooked,"" and that Netanyahu ""views the horrifying incident with utmost gravity."" He demanded that the Dutch government take ""vigorous and swift action"" against those involved. Netanyahu's office added that he had called for increased security for the Jewish community in the Netherlands. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said on X that he followed reports of the violence ""with horror."" ""Completely unacceptable antisemitic attacks on Israelis. I am in close contact with everyone involved,"" he added, saying that he had spoken to Netanyahu and ""emphasized that the perpetrators will be tracked down and prosecuted. It is now quiet in the capital."" Geert Wilders, the hard right nationalist lawmaker whose Party for Freedom won elections in the Netherlands last year and who is a staunch ally of Israel, reacted to a video apparently showing a Maccabi fan being surrounded by several men. ""Looks like a Jew hunt in the streets of Amsterdam. Arrest and deport the multicultural scum that attacked Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters in our streets. Ashamed that this can happen in The Netherlands. Totally unacceptable,"" Wilders said. Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, also condemned the violence in a post on the social media platform X.

Australia was 163 all out in 35 overs against Rauf's relentless pace and left-hander Ayub smashed six sixes and five fours as Pakistan cruised to 169-1 in 26.3 overs to level the three-match series. Former captain Babar Azam (15 not out) clinched the victory with a pulled six off Adam Zampa with Abdullah Shafique staying unbeaten on 64 off 69 balls which featured four boundaries and three sixes. The series decider will be played at Perth on Sunday with Australia resting five frontline players to prepare for the five-match home test series against India, starting from Nov. 22 at Perth. ""Obviously this win gives us confidence,"" said Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan, who won the toss and elected to field. ""We want to keep that confidence going. All the bowlers had plans and they worked well."" The opening pair of Ayub and Shafique had been criticized for a run of low scores in test matches, but both blunted the Australian pace with a match-winning stand of 137 runs after Pakistan kept faith in the duo in the white-ball format. Ayub took his time against fast bowler Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc before he grew in confidence and flicked Pat Cummins, Starc and Aaron Hardie for sixes and also smashed Zampa for two big hits. The left-hander, who made his ODI debut at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Monday, got a reprieve just before reaching a half century when Zampa dropped a sitter at third man, but he offered a tame catch at short third man just when he looked set for a century. Earlier, Rauf, who nearly pulled off a victory for Pakistan in the first game, found the outside edges of the bats consistently by hitting the right lengths. Wicketkeeper Rizwan took six catches - four off Rauf's bowling - and could have had a seventh one had he not dropped a top-edge off Zampa (18) before Australia was dismissed. Shaheen Shah Afridi (3-26) provided the breakthrough inside the first power play. Jake Fraser-McGurk hit three crisp boundaries on the off side in Naseem Shah's first over to get Australia rolling before Afridi's twin strike pushed back Australia. Afridi dropped Matt Short at deep fine leg when the ball burst through his hands to the boundary but the left-arm fast bowler made amends when he had Short caught at covers after trapping Fraser-McGurk plumb leg before wicket. Afridi ended Australia's below-par innings when Zampa played a full ball back onto his stumps. Zampa flicked Naseem Shah for a six and a four in an over which enabled the home team to cross the 150-run mark. Rauf sliced through the middle-order with only Steve Smith scoring 35 off 48 balls before he too chased a wide short ball of Mohammad Hasnain and edged behind the wicket. Hazlewood replaced Sean Abbott in the only change Australia made from the team which edged Pakistan in the first game. Starc, Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Cummins and Hazlewood all will be rested for the final game of the series on Sunday. Wicketkeeper-batter Josh Inglis was named interim captain for the last ODI at Perth. Inglis will also lead the side in next week's three T20s against Pakistan with Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head away on paternity leave. ""Wasn't one of our best days,"" Cummins said of Friday's heavy loss. ""You hope to get more than 160, (but) they bowled well. We got some catchers in, tried to attack, but it wasn't to be.""","rauf, the, josh, ayub, rizwan, mohammad, inglis, mcgurk, fraser, series, haris, ball, naseem, hazlewood, shah, bowler, afridi, azam, babar, hander"

A calm Cummins made an unbeaten 32 off 31 balls to steer Australia to 204-8 with more than 16 overs to spare, after the middle-order had stumbled in a modest run chase. Searing pace from Mitchell Starc (3-33) had earlier helped to bowl out Pakistan for 203 with Cummins, playing his first international since the T20 World Cup in June, picking up 2-39 after he won the toss and elected to field. ""It's always nice to start the summer off in a positive way,"" said Cummins. ""We are looking for powerplay wickets ... (and) it was a really positive effort with the ball. Maybe a little sloppy from us in the field."" Josh Inglis (49) and Steve Smith (44) had the chase under control at 113-2 before Pakistan's four-pronged pace attack had Australia reeling at 155-7 on a bouncy MCG wicket. Fast bowler Haris Rauf (3-67) ignited the collapse when he had Smith caught at point and then Marnus Labuschagne (16) and Glenn Maxwell (0) were undone by pacey deliveries. Shaheen Shah Afridi picked up 2-43, but Cummins added 30 runs with Sean Abbott before the skipper carried his side over the line for a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Earlier, five of Pakistan's six top-order batters, fresh from playing on spinning wickets at home against England, struggled to cope with the pace of Starc and Cummins. Babar Azam, who was omitted from the last two test victories against England, made a fluent 37 as the rest of the top-order crumbled. Starc removed debutant Saim Ayub in his second over when the left-hander played the ball back onto his stumps, and Abdullah Shafique couldn't pull his bat out of the way of another short delivery and was caught behind. Starc, playing his 54th ODI in Australia, reached 100 wickets at home and broke the record of Brett Lee, who achieved his milestone in 55 ODIs. The left-armer Starc is now fourth on the all-time list of Australian ODI bowlers, behind Glenn McGrath, Lee and Shane Warne. Pakistan's new white-ball captain Mohammad Rizwan struggled to accelerate before leg-spinner Adam Zampa had Babar clean bowled in his first over. Rizwan made 44 off 71 balls before he top-edged a sweep to Labuschagne, the ball deflecting off his helmet to gave wicketkeeper Inglis his third catch. Kamran Ghulam couldn't gauge the steep bounce provided by Cummins and gloved a simple catch behind the wicket before the Pakistan tail-enders frustrated Australia. Naseem Shah smashed a better than a run-a-ball 40 with four sixes and Afridi scored a quickfire 24 off 19 balls which lifted Pakistan beyond the 200-run mark. But Cummins wrapped up the innings by having Naseem caught at mid-off. Naseem and Afridi then dismissed openers Jake Fraser-McGurk (16) and Matt Short (1) before Smith and Inglis combined in an 85-run partnership. Pakistan fought back well with the majority of the 25,831 spectators backing the visitors, but Cummins took his side home at the end. Naseem injured his left calf in his follow through and left the field with Australia needing eight for victory. ""I think we did very well,"" said Rizwan, who replaced Babar as Pakistan's new white-ball captain. ""We missed a few chances and the luck was with Australia, so congratulations to them. It's difficult to read anything into this game ... but I'm happy with the fight we put up."" The second game will be played in Adelaide on Friday with the final ODI in Perth on Sunday. The series will be followed by three T20s.","odi, the, his, pakistan, captain, cummins, inglis, wicket, zampa, rauf, haris, ball, saim, adam, pace, ayub, run, starc, babar, rizwan"

Raphinha also scored for Barcelona, which a week ago had routed Real Madrid 4-0 in the clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. Barcelona is now nine points ahead of Madrid, whose game at Valencia on Saturday was postponed because of the deadly floods that killed more than 200 people in southern Spain last week. The game between Villarreal and Rayo Vallecano also was postponed, as were three second-division games scheduled to be played in the region this weekend. The victory extended Barcelona's 27-match unbeaten streak against Espanyol in the league. Espanyol, sitting in 17th place, has lost six of its last seven league matches. Olmo scored his double in his return as a starter after hurting his right hamstring on Sept. 15 against Girona. He had come off the bench in the team's wins against Bayern Munich in the Champions League and Madrid in the Spanish league. ""I was excited about coming back,"" Olmo said. ""I'm feeling well. It was important to keep winning."" He put Barcelona ahead in the 12th minute from close range after a neat cross by Lamine Yamal with the outside of his left foot. Olmo's second goal came with a strike from outside the area in the 31st. In his first season with Barcelona, Olmo now has five goals in five matches. Raphinha added to the lead in the 23rd by redirecting the ball into the net with one touch after Marc Casadó's long cross into the area. Barcelona has outscored its league opponents 40-11 in 12 matches. Madrid has the second-best attack with 21 goals scored. ""We are a team that can score a lot, not only with our strikers but also with the players in the second line,"" Olmo said. ""We play very direct and create many opportunities."" Espanyol thought it had moved closer in the 27th but Jofre Carrera's goal was called off after video review because of offside. It also had a goal by Álvaro Tejero disallowed for offside in the 58th, then Javi Puado finally scored a goal that counted in the 63rd. Barcelona also had a goal called off in stoppage time. Before the match, Barcelona honored those who received awards at the Ballon d'Or ceremony last week, including Yamal, who earned the Kopa Trophy award for best Under-21 player, and Aitana Bonmatí, who won the award for the world's best woman soccer player. Barcelona also won the best women's team prize. There was also a moment of silence in honor of the flood victims, which has taken place at all league matches this weekend. Simeone's son scores Giuliano Simeone, son of Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone, scored his first goal with the club in the team's 2-0 win against Las Palmas. The goal came more than 20 years after Simeone's last league goal with the club as a player. Alexander Sorloth netted Atletico's second goal on Sunday, helping move the club back to third place, 10 points behind Barcelona. Other results Sixth-place Athletic Bilbao drew 1-1 against Real Betis, while 10th-place Real Sociedad won 2-0 at Sevilla with goals from Takefusa Kubo and Mikel Oyarzabal.","the, simeone, league, goal, madrid, atletico, jofre, casadó, carrera, kopa, matches, ballon, olmo, bilbao, athletic, marc, second, diego, derby, place"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/barcelona-routs-real-madrid-again-to-win-spanish-super-cup-final-5-2,Barcelona routs Real Madrid again to win Spanish Super Cup final 5-2,Associated Press,2025-01-14 18:52:55,"MADRID, JANUARY 14 Real Madrid came out looking for some payback in the latest ""clasico"" against Barcelona but ended up being embarrassed again. Madrid lost 5-2 to Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Sunday. That followed a 4-0 loss at home to Barcelona in the Spanish league in October. Kylian Mbappé put Madrid ahead early in his second clasico, but Barcelona then ran away with goals by Lamine Yamal, Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha - who scored twice - and Alejandro Balde. Rodrygo scored for Madrid on the hour mark after Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off early in the second half. It was the third straight win for Barcelona in 2025 after it lost two games in a row to end last year. ""The Christmas break helped us reflect on what we had done wrong,"" Lewandowski said. ""Now we can look forward to the run of games that we have until the end of the season."" Madrid lost for the first time after a run of five consecutive victories. ""It was a bad night,"" Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. ""It's a disappointment, we won't hide it, but it's soccer ... you have to try to learn from the losses. We have to look forward to what's ahead."" Mbappé had been contained when the rivals met in October but scored a superb goal five minutes into the match at King Abdullah Sports City stadium after picking up the ball just inside Madrid's half, running at the defense and then finding the net with a clever finish. But Yamal evened the match with a nice run in the 22nd and Lewandowski, who scored twice in the earlier clasico, put the Catalans ahead in the 36th. Raphinha added goals in the 39th and 48th minutes, while Balde scored in first-half stoppage time. Rodrygo scored from a free kick in the 60th after Szczesny was sent off for a foul outside the area to stop a breakaway. Lewandowski has 26 goals in 27 appearance across all competitions for Barcelona, while Raphinha has scored 19 times and Yamal eight. Barcelona was able to count on Spain midfielder Dani Olmo after the Spanish government stepped in to provisionally allow the club to register him with the league. The final came after Mallorca fans said they were harassed by local men who support Madrid after Thursday's semifinal. Two wives of Mallorca players said they were groped. The Spanish Super Cup has become a moneymaker for the federation and competing clubs since the federation struck a deal in 2019 to hold it in Saudi Arabia. Atletico's record Atletico Madrid set a club all-time record of 14 straight victories with a 1-0 win over Osasuna on Sunday and went top of the Spanish league at the halfway stage. Julián Álvarez scored in the 55th minute at the Metropolitano stadium to give Atletico the milestone victory and a one-point lead over second-place Madrid. Diego Simeone's team has a six-point gap to third-place Barcelona. Atletico has won all of its matches across all competitions since October. Its last setback was a 1-0 loss at Real Betis in the Spanish league on Oct. 27. Eight of the victories have come in the league. ""It's an important streak to show the growth of this club,"" Simeone said. ""We have been working really hard."" It was the seventh consecutive league game without a win for Osasuna, which is in 11th place. Also Sunday, 15th-place Getafe won 2-1 at 14th-place Las Palmas.","madrid, the, spanish, clasico, atletico, victories, szczesny, wojciech, place, mallorca, olmo, palmas, super, dani, las, simeone, ancelotti, carlo, diego, half"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/barcelona-edges-real-madrid-in-extra-time-to-win-copa-del-rey-final,Barcelona edges Real Madrid in extra time to win Copa del Rey final,Associated Press,2025-04-27 12:53:17,"SEVILLE, APRIL 27 Barcelona has launched its bid for a treble after edging Real Madrid 3-2 in a thrilling Copa del Rey final with Jules Koundé scoring an extra-time winner on Saturday. Right back Koundé pounced on a pass by Luka Modric and fired into the low corner of Thibaut Courtois' net for the 116th-minute decider. Barcelona will carry momentum from its record-extending 32nd Copa del Rey title into Wednesday's start of its Champions League semifinal series against Inter Milan. It also leads La Liga by four points over Madrid. Pedri González dictated the game for Barcelona from midfield and scored from long range to take a 28th minute-lead at La Cartuja Stadium. Madrid rallied with two second-half goals, with Kylian Mbappé coming off the bench at halftime and scoring from a free kick in the 70th and midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni's header in the 77th making it 2-1. Ferran Torres leveled in the 84th to force extra time. Barcelona has beaten Madrid in all three of the clasicos this season, including a 5-2 rout in the Spanish Super Cup final in January after winning 4-0 at Madrid in the league in October. ""This was such a physically demanding game, but we showed that we are a great team that never gives up,"" said Torres, who filled in perfectly for the injured Robert Lewandowski. The loss to its fierce rival was another blow to Madrid after it was knocked out of the Champions League quarterfinals by Arsenal. This could have been its last title decider with Carlo Ancelotti in charge. The Italian coach said he will decide his future this summer amid speculation he is bound to take over Brazil. Ancelotti, when asked about his future, said: ""As I have said, I can continue, I can stop, it will be a topic for the coming weeks."" While Ancelotti's second stint in Madrid appears to be coming to an end, Hansi Flick has only added to his superb first season with Barcelona. The German coach has invigorated a group of players who seemed spent under Xavi Hernández and helped young players such as Lamine Yamal and Pau Cubarsí continue to grow into stars. ""I have to say thanks to the team because they had an unbelievable performance,"" Flick said. ""A huge win in the Copa final is great for everyone and it gives us confidence for more."" King Felipe VI awarded the trophy to Barcelona captains Ronald Araujo and Marc-Andre ter Stegen, after the monarch returned to Spain following his attendance at the funeral of Pope Francis. The trophy is the first piece needed to repeat a treble that Barcelona won under Pep Guardiola in 2009 and Luis Enrique in 2015. Red for Rudiger on bench Madrid's Antonio Rudiger was shown a red card by the referee in the final moments when he apparently threw wice at the referee and shouted aggressively. Jude Bellingham and Lucas Vázquez were also shown red cards for protesting. Barcelona dominates first half One of the biggest rivalries in global soccer was again a tale of two halves – until Torres scored the late equalizer against the flow of play to renew Barcelona's prospects. Barcelona dominated the first half with its ball control and a pressure defense that was quick to recover the ball. The only semblance of a Madrid attack came when Bellingham was able to spin away from his marker. But a Bellingham pass intercepted by Cubarsí cued Barcelona's opener. Pedri lobbed forward for Yamal, breaking down the flank. The 17-year-old phenom – sporting a new dyed-blond hairdo – threaded a pass back to the top of the box, where Pedri arrived to blast it home. Mbappé sparks Madrid fightback Mbappé started the game on the bench after injuring his ankle last week. But Ancelotti sent his striker on at halftime to replace Rodrygo. Modric and playmaker Arda Guler soon followed. The changes helped Madrid click, and the game became a back-and-forth contest with both teams creating scoring chances. Wojciech Szczesny had to protect Barcelona's lead with three saves to deny Vinícius Júnior and Mbappé. The goalkeeper could do nothing, however, to stop Mbappe after he earned a foul and fired a free kick low and just inside the post. Tchouaméni rose up to head in a corner kick that Guler curled into to the edge of the six-yard box. Barcelona finishes it off ""I told Ronald (Araujo) that it doesn't matter if they score one goal, it doesn't matter if they score two goals. They can't hang with us,"" Yamal said after his two-assist performance. Turns out, he was right. Yamal put a long ball behind the defense and Courtois mistimed his run out to intercept it, leaving Torres with an open net to tie it up. Raphinha thought he had a penalty in the final minute of injury time after contact with Raúl Asencio. But the referee, who the day before the final denounced a campaign to discredit him by Real Madrid's official club television, waived off his initial decision after consulting video. With several players clearly exhausted in extra time the game appeared destined to finish in a penalty shootout. But that was when Koundé became the hero for the Catalan club.","the, copa, del, rey, madrid, league, minute, barcelona, arda, guler, cubarsí, rudiger, his, araujo, felipe, aurélien, tchouaméni, thibaut, courtois, champions"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/no-comeback-for-real-madrid-as-arsenal-is-back-in-champions-league-semifinals,No comeback for Real Madrid as Arsenal is back in Champions League semifinals,Associated Press,2025-04-17 21:54:26,"MADRID, APRIL 17 Arsenal defeated defending champion Real Madrid 2-1 on Wednesday to reach the Champions League semifinals for the first time since 2009 in a match where VAR played a key role in two penalty decisions. Arsenal advanced 5-1 on aggregate after winning 3-0 in London last week, keeping alive its chances of winning Europe's top club competition for the first time. It will face Paris Saint-Germain in the semifinals. Inter Milan advanced past Bayern Munich on Wednesday and will meet Barcelona in the semifinals. There was no historic comeback for Madrid this time. No late goals, no high drama, no magic at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium. The 15-time European champions fell short of the last four for the first time since 2020, ending its shot at a third Champions League title in four seasons. ""There was a lot of talk coming here about (Real Madrid) coming back, because they've done it so many times before, but we had so much belief and confidence from that first game to come here and win,"" Arsenal's Declan Rice said. ""We had it in our minds and now we've done it in real life."" Momentum shift Madrid's hopes of staging another comeback took a big hit when a five-minute VAR review overturned a penalty for a hold on Kylian Mbappé in the first half with the game tied 0-0. Arsenal earlier had been awarded a penalty after a video review, but Bukayo Saka missed his spot kick. Saka was able to put Arsenal ahead from inside the area after Mikel Merino's pass in the 65th minute, and Madrid couldn't manage more than an equalizer by Vinícius Júnior a couple of minutes later after a defensive blunder by William Saliba. Gabriel Martinelli completed the scoring three minutes into stoppage time, also after an assist by Merino. ""This is one of the best nights in my football career, for sure,"" Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta said. ""It's a really special one against a team that has been an inspiration for a lot of us in this competition. To win this tie in the manner that we have, we can be very proud."" Injured Mbappe Mbappé was replaced by Brahim Díaz in the 75th with an apparent injury and part of the crowd at the Bernabeu jeered the France star when his substitution was announced. It was another lackluster performance for Mbappé, who is yet to win a Champions League title. ""It's a tough moment,"" Madrid's Lucas Vazquez said. ""We tried but in the end we couldn't achieve our goal. We'll come back stronger. Madrid always does."" It was a tough assignment for Madrid from the start. Arsenal hasn't lost by a three-goal margin in nearly three years, and only four times has a home team erased a first-leg deficit of three goals or more in the Champions League era, according to UEFA. Arsenal hadn't lost to Madrid in the teams' three previous meetings. It also overcame Madrid in the Champions League knockout stage in 2005-06, when it reached the final and eventually lost the title to Barcelona. Ancelotti's perspective ""We have to hold our heads high because we did very well in this competition in recent years,"" Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. ""This year we have to endure and suffer. In sport, this can happen because there are no invincible teams. I was clear with my players. We have to keep our heads up, we have to learn from it and fight for the next game."" Ancelotti said he didn't know if the loss would mean his last Champions League match with Madrid, ""Maybe the club will decide to make a change. It could be this year or next year, when my contract runs out,"" he said. ""The day I finish here I can only do one thing and that is to thank this club. It could be tomorrow, in 10 days or in a year and the only thing I will do is thank the club."" Backed by a raucous crowd at the Bernabeu, Madrid tried to get off to a strong start. It found the net in the second minute but Mbappé's effort was disallowed for a clear offside. Arsenal had a chance to increase its advantage after being awarded a penalty about 10 minutes later, but Saka's chip from the spot was saved by Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. The penalty was awarded after Raúl Asencio held Mikel Merino inside the area during a corner kick in an action that was missed by French referee François Letexier. But he was called over to the pitchside monitor by the VAR to review the incident and then pointed to the spot. Video review played a role again in the 23rd, after Mbappé was held inside the area by Rice. Letexier pointed to the spot but after a lengthy VAR check he had to reverse his decision.","champions, madrid, the, mikel, league, merino, mbappé, bernabeu, ancelotti, var, arsenal, letexier, françois, comeback, minute, vazquez, thibaut, courtois, semifinals, review"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/man-united-seals-spectacular-comeback-to-beat-lyon-5-4-and-advance-to-europa-league-semifinals,Man United seals spectacular comeback to beat Lyon 5-4 and advance to Europa League semifinals,Associated Press,2025-04-18 22:54:33,"MANCHESTER, APRIL 18 Manchester United's season isn't done yet. On a night of high drama at Old Trafford, the troubled Premier League club put its domestic problems to one side by sealing a spectacular comeback to beat Lyon 5-4 and advance to the semifinals of the Europa League. United blew a two-goal lead and then had to come back from 4-2 down against 10 men in extra time to produce one of its most memorable victories in its famous stadium. Harry Maguire's dramatic winner in added time of extra time sparked scenes of jubilation and kept alive hopes that United could yet salvage a desperate campaign that has left the 20-time English champions languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League. ""We still have time to make something special of this season, so we have to think like that and be positive,"" United head coach Ruben Amorim said. United will play Athletic Bilbao in the semifinals after the Spanish club beat Rangers 2-0. Tottenham also overcame its domestic problems by sealing a place in the last four with a 1-0 win against Eintracht Frankfurt and a 2-1 aggregate victory. Bodo/Glimt became the first Norwegian team to reach the semifinals of a European competition by beating Lazio 3-2 on penalties. Lazio sent the game to a shootout after 3-1 win in extra time meant the tie ended 3-3 on aggregate. Comeback king United has been famed for its comebacks over the years - none more famous than victory against Bayern Munich to win the Champions League final in 1999 when late goals by Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sealed a 2-1 win. Such moments feel a long way away for a team that is languishing 14th in England's top flight and is guaranteed to end the campaign with a club-record-low points total in the Premier League era. The Europa League is Amorim's last chance of success this season, while victory would also secure a place in the lucrative Champions League next campaign. United had led 2-0 at halftime through goals from Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot and could have been further ahead with Bruno Fernandes hitting the bar and Alejandro Garnacho failing to score when through on goal. But it let a commanding position slip by conceding twice in six minutes in the second half, with Corentin Tolisso and Nicolas Tagliafico stunning the home crowd. Despite Tolisso being sent off in the 89th, Lyon led 4-2 in extra time through Rayan Cherki and an Alexandre Lacazette penalty. As some fans started to leave the stadium, United mounted a comeback with three goals in seven minutes. Fernandes scored from the penalty spot and then Kobbie Mainoo leveled with a curling shot inside the box. The stage was set for Maguire - playing as a makeshift striker - to head the winner. ""It was fun,"" said Amorim. ""If you see the goals from Kobbie and Harry Maguire, the sound of the stadium was the best sound I ever (heard). You want to keep that. People want to keep a lot of things, shirts, I just want to keep that sound, it's the best sound in the world."" Oihan Sancet and Nico Williams were on target for United's semifinals opponent Bilbao. A 2-0 win against Rangers at San Mames settled the tie after the first leg ended 0-0. Tottenham advances Dominic Solanke's first-half penalty secured victory for Tottenham against Eintracht Frankfurt. Spurs have also endured a miserable domestic campaign and are one place below United in the league. But the deep run in the Europa League has provided rare moments of optimism and it remains in with a chance of winning a first trophy since 2008. ""The players believe in what we're doing and I'm so proud of them because it was a big game for us - no doubt about it - for our season, for everything, and what we're trying to achieve,"" Tottenham coach Ange Postecoglou said. Spurs needed the assistance of VAR when it was awarded a penalty for a foul by Frankfurt goalkeeper Kaua Santos on James Maddison. Solanke fired down the middle for the decisive goal in the 43rd minute. Spurs will face Norwegian history maker Bodo/Glimt in the semifinals. Bodo/Glimt goalkeeper Nikitka Haikin denied Lazio's Taty Castellanos from the spot to decide the shootout. ""It's historic, not only for Bodø/Glimt but for all of Norwegian football,"" Haikin said. ""Even after I saved Castellanos' shot, I didn't realise we'd won - but then I saw the guys running and I started running too."" Conference League Big teams remain in the third-tier UEFA Conference League after Chelsea, Fiorentina and Real Betis all advanced to the semifinals. Chelsea's 3-0 first leg win against Legia Warsaw meant it would have taken a remarkable turnaround at Stamford Bridge to prevent the two-time Champions League winner from progressing. And despite a 2-1 loss, Chelsea won 4-2 on aggregate. Fiorentina needed Moise Kean's second-half goal to draw 2-2 at home against Celje and a 4-3 aggregate win. Betis advanced 3-1 on aggregate against Jagiellonia Bialystok after a 1-1 draw. Djurgarden beat SK Rapid 4-1 to seal a 4-2 aggregate win.

Runaway league leader Liverpool needs six more points to claim a record-equaling 20th English title, but three would have been enough if Arsenal had lost at Ipswich. Such an upset never looked likely after Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli gave Champions League semifinalist Arsenal a 2-0 halftime lead at Portman Road. Trossard scored again after the break and Ethan Nwaneri rounded off the win before Liverpool played Leicester City later Sunday.

In his second season leading a team in the competition, Arteta pits his wits on Tuesday in the first-leg quarterfinal against Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti, who is in his 22nd Champions League campaign and has a record five titles. ""One hundred percent, it's a joy,"" Arteta said on Monday when asked if hosting defending champion Madrid was the biggest night of his management career. ""That's why I came into football, and that's why I came into management and especially to this football club."" The Arsenal boss returned in 2019 to take charge of a club where he played for five seasons. Arsenal meets Madrid for the first time since 2006, when Thierry Henry's goal at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium was decisive in the round of 16. The Gunners went on to lose to Barcelona in the club's only visit to the final in 70 years of the European Cup and Champions League. ""It's been 20 years since we had this type of game,"" Arteta said. ""For us, it's a great opportunity to build our own story. This is the stage where we want to be, where Arsenal has to be consistently."" Arsenal is in the quarterfinals for a second straight season under Arteta, having lost to Bayern Munich one year ago. That came after a 14-year wait to return to this level. During that period, Ancelotti won three Champions League titles with Madrid - in 2014, 2022 and last season - adding to two he won while coaching AC Milan, in 2003 and 2007. Ancelotti was an inspiration for the calm he brings to his teams, Arteta said of his counterpart. Arteta can pick Bukayo Saka to start a game for the first time since December, after two appearances from the bench in the Premier League after a hamstring injury. ""He's in a good place to be able to be used,"" Arteta said of his talismanic winger. However, defender Gabriel Magalhaes was out for the season after injuring his hamstring last Tuesday in a 2-1 win over Fulham that marked Saka's comeback.","league, champions, madrid, ancelotti, arteta, magalhaes, thierry, his, saka, arsenal, the, season, henry, carlo, gabriel, hamstring, real, mikel, club, titles"

Arsenal, Villa, Dortmund also advance",Associated Press,2025-03-13 18:46:22,"MADRID, MARCH 13 Real Madrid beat Atletico Madrid in a Champions League penalty shootout - again - to keep its title defense alive Wednesday and advance to the quarterfinals. Defender Antonio Rüdiger scored the decisive spot-kick in a 4-2 shootout win after two Atletico players missed. Marco Llorente's shot struck the bar after Julián Álvarez's score despite slipping was disallowed on video review because he touched the ball twice. Madrid also beat Atletico in a shootout to win the 2016 final - part of a streak of eliminating its city rival in the knockout rounds for four straight years. That hard-luck run started with the 2014 final when Atletico gave up an equalizing goal in stoppage time. Madrid moves on to the quarterfinals to face Arsenal, which also advanced Wednesday along with Aston Villa and Borussia Dortmund. The quarterfinals lineup was completed with Madrid's win in a tense derby that had ended 2-2 on aggregate score. Atletico led 1-0 after 90 minutes and extra time in a typically tenacious performance at its Metropolitano Stadium to cancel out Madrid's 2-1 advantage from the first leg last week. ""When you get knocked out, it is not easy to digest,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone said, ""but I go out with a feeling of peace."" Two key incidents defined regulation time. Atletico Madrid scored within 30 seconds and Real Madrid missed a penalty in the 70th minute. Atletico took the lead with its first attack when England midfielder Conor Gallagher pounced on the ball from close range when a cross by Rodrigo De Paul was deflected into the goalmouth. Madrid star Vinícius Júnior blazed a penalty kick high over the Atletico goal when he could have sent the 15-time champion through. He was substituted in extra time for his teenage fellow Brazilian, Endrick. Kylian Mbappé and Jude Bellingham stepped up to score Madrid's first two spot-kicks, and Fede Valverde also scored before Lucas Vazquez's kick was saved by Jan Oblak. It was more relaxed in London, where Arsenal rested some regulars in a 2-2 draw with PSV Eindhoven to run up a 9-3 aggregate score. Aston Villa also had a stress-free evening at home to ensure England has two teams in the quarterfinals, one night after Premier League leader Liverpool was beaten at Anfield by Paris Saint-Germain in a shootout. Villa won 3-0 against Club Brugge, which played with 10 men from the 17th, after a 3-1 win in Belgium last week. Brugge defender Kyriani Sabbe was sent off for pulling back Marcus Rashford when running clear on goal. Substitute Marco Asensio, on loan at Villa from PSG, scored twice in the second half to ensure his temporary club will meet his parent club next. Borussia Dortmund rallied with two second-half goals to win 2-1 at Lille and advance 3-2 on aggregate. The beaten finalist last season now faces Barcelona. Quarterfinals draw The quarterfinals pairings are: Arsenal vs Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain vs. Aston Villa, Barcelona vs. Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich vs. Inter Milan First-leg games are on April 8-9 and return games are one week later. England's unexpected challenge There's only one former European champion from England left in the Champions League. Villa's unbeaten home record has driven its run to the quarterfinal, with wins against Bayern, Bologna, Celtic and now Brugge. Liverpool's exit to PSG followed Manchester City being pushed out of the knockout playoffs last month by Real Madrid. Without the Champions League winners in 2019 and 2023, respectively, England's challenge halved to just two. Villa's 1982 European Cup title is perhaps a less-remembered one in the competition's 70-year history. Arsenal's only time in the final was a loss to Barcelona in 2006. Villa manager Unai Emery now goes back to Paris where his two seasons as coach there until 2018 seemed to be unsatisfactory for both parties. Dortmund thrives in Europe Just like last season, Borussia Dortmund is better in the Champions League than the German league. The Bundesliga's 10th-place team trailed Lille from the fifth minute to Canada forward Jonathan David's shot, before rallying in the second half for a decisive 2-1 win. Dortmund leveled in the 54th from Emre Can's penalty and Maximilian Beier sealed the victory nine minutes later with a rising shot. Dortmund was the beaten finalist last June – losing 2-0 to Real Madrid at Wembley Stadium – and got into this Champions League only because Germany earned a bonus entry for fifth place in the Bundesliga. Niko Kovač, the club's third coach in the Champions League this season, now takes Dortmund to face former star forward Robert Lewandowski at Barcelona. Top-5 leagues dominate Expected exits for Brugge and PSV - after Benfica and Feyenoord were eliminated Tuesday - leaves only the five wealthiest leagues in Europe are now represented. No team from outside England, Spain, Germany, Italy or France has reached the Champions League final since Porto coached by Jose Mourinho won in 2004. UEFA will share almost 2.5 billion euros ($2.7 billion) total prize money among the 36 Champions League teams this season and the 20% higher payouts this season figure to widen the wealth gap in European soccer. England and Spain also are in line for bonus fifth places in the Champions League next season, sending tens of millions more in prize money there. Each quarterfinalist will get 12.5 million euros ($13.6 million). A place in the semifinals pays an extra 15 million euros ($16.3 million).","madrid, league, the, euros, marco, champions, atletico, quarterfinals, villa, club, shootout, brugge, llorente, asensio, sabbe, kyriani, european, vazquez, rüdiger, kick"

The remodeled tournament is back to the round of 16, which used to kick off the knockout stages until UEFA added the extra playoff round this season. In addition to the Madrid derby, the other matches on Tuesday will include Arsenal visiting PSV Eindhoven, Club Brugge facing Aston Villa, and Borussia Dortmund - last year's runner-up to Madrid - taking on Lille. On Wednesday, it will be Paris Saint-Germain hosting Liverpool, Inter Milan visiting Feyenoord, Benfica taking on Barcelona, and Bayern Munich welcoming fellow German club Bayer Leverkusen. The Madrid derby will take place at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, with Atletico taking on old nemesis Madrid, the record 15-time European champion that struggled in the league phase and needed to get past Manchester City in the playoff stage. Atletico secured an automatic spot in the round of 16 by doing well in the league phase, and more than ever it has the confidence that it can finally end its slump against its city rival in the Champions League. ""We have a lot of respect for our rival,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone said. ""But we also know our strengths."" Simeone's team lost two finals to Madrid - in 2014 and 2016 - and was eliminated the other two times they faced off in the knockout rounds - in the 2015 quarterfinals and 2017 semifinals. Madrid hasn't beaten Atletico in four consecutive matches in all competitions, being eliminated in the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey last season. ""We know it will be an even match and we feel that it will be decided in the return leg,"" Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. ""We can't think about trying to take a big lead tomorrow, it's not possible because our rival is competing very well and the tie will be even until the end."" Other matchups Arsenal finished third in the inaugural league phase behind Barcelona and fellow Premier League club Liverpool. It will visit a PSV Eindhoven side that handed Liverpool its only defeat in the league phase, then got past Juventus in the playoffs in extra time. Borussia Dortmund, seeking a second consecutive final appearance, will host a Lille team that finished seventh in the league phase in a campaign that included victories over both Madrid and Atletico. Aston Villa also was a league-phase surprise, losing only once to finish eighth and set up the round-of-16 matchup against a Club Brugge squad that defeated Villa 1-0 at home in November and eliminated Atalanta in the playoffs.","madrid, league, club, phase, eindhoven, psv, simeone, derby, the, playoff, carlo, ancelotti, brugge, diego, borussia, bayer, atletico, leverkusen, dortmund, knockout"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/mbappe-hat-trick-for-real-madrid-dumps-man-city-out-of-champions-league-psg-and-dortmund-advance,Mbappé hat trick for Real Madrid dumps Man City out of Champions League. PSG and Dortmund advance,Associated Press,2025-02-20 21:29:53,"MADRID, FEBRUARY 20 Kylian Mbappé scored a hat trick, Erling Haaland stayed on the bench injured and Real Madrid dumped Manchester City out of the Champions League on Wednesday. Mbappé's stellar trio of goals in the fourth, 33rd and 61st minutes in a 3-1 win gave Madrid a 6-3 victory on aggregate over the 2023 champion in their two-leg knockout playoff. ""This has been the complete performance - attack, defense, with the ball and without the ball, we showed such high levels of quality,"" Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. ""Almost the perfect night."" One superstar striker was watched by another from the sidelines. Haaland was not fit to start for an ultimately overmatched Man City because of a knee injury sustained late in a Premier League game Saturday. Paris Saint-Germain beat French rival Brest 7-0, to run up a 10-0 aggregate score, and will play either Liverpool or Barcelona in the round of 16. PSV Eindhoven ousted Juventus in the only one of the eight playoffs this week that went to extra time. Defender Ryan Flamingo scored in the 98th minute for a 3-1 win on the night and 4-3 on aggregate. United States international Timothy Weah scored for Juventus. ""Honestly, we slipped up,"" Weah said. ""I felt like they were more aggressive on the night and we lacked a bit of aggression and hunger."" In the early game Wednesday, Borussia Dortmund started with a 3-0 lead at home to Sporting Lisbon and was barely stretched in a 0-0 draw. Sporting's Champions League campaign imploded after coach Ruben Amorim left for Manchester United in November. Mbappé mastery Mbappé's first goal of the two-leg playoff in Manchester was a lucky miscue, a looping effort off his shin to level at 1-1 in what ended a 3-2 win. His three goals in Madrid were classy and decisive. A first-time lob over City goalkeeper Ederson - who perhaps advanced too far, too soon - was followed by a low shot after leaving defender Joško Gvardiol on the turf. The third was a powerful left-footer from the edge of the penalty area when he had lured six Man City players toward encircling him. ""I have always said I didn't come here simply to complete a dream,"" said Mbappé, a boyhood Madrid fan who never won a Champions League at Monaco and PSG. ""I want to play well, I want to mark an era."" Coach Pep Guardiola's injury-hit side - with Ballon d'Or winner Rodri out since September and Kevin De Bruyne now rarely starting - has looked like a shadow of the heavyweight rival that met Madrid in each of the past three seasons, when each time the winner went on to lift the trophy. Paris Saint-Germain hits 10 PSG has not lost anywhere since a Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich three months ago, and the playoff against Brest proved a total mismatch. Brest had impressed in its first European season but went out with a whimper at Parc des Princes, after a 3-0 loss in the home leg. Wingers Bradley Barcola and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia scored in the first half. Midfielder Vitinha, Desiré Doué, left back Nuno Mendes, striker Ramos and Senny Mayulu netted after the break. PSG also beat Brest 5-2 in a French league game this month. Sporting slumps post-Amorim With Ruben Amorim as coach, Sporting was unbeaten in four Champions League games and stood second in the 36-team standings. The team he left behind went winless in six Champions League games under two different coaches. Dortmund also fired a coach midseason and newly hired Niko Kovač now has two wins on the European stage to offset two straight losses in the German league. Still, Sporting's prospects to be in the Champions League next season look better than Dortmund's. Portugal's champion advances direct to the next league phase and Sporting currently is top, two points clear of Benfica. Dortmund is 11th in the Bundesliga and could need to win this Champions League title to earn a place in the next edition. Round of 16 draw Real Madrid, PSG, Dortmund and PSV join Bayern Munich, Benfica, Club Brugge and Feyenoord, which all advanced Tuesday, as playoff round winners who will be unseeded teams in Friday's draw. They will host the first-leg games on March 4-5. The top eight in the 36-team standings three weeks ago - Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen, Lille, Aston Villa - skipped the playoffs round and are seeded in the round of 16 draw. They host second legs on March 11-12. The round of 16 is in a new, tennis-like seeded bracket for the knockout stage in the expanded competition format. Madrid, as the 11th-place team in the standings and No. 11 seed already knew its next opponent would be Atletico or Leverkusen, who respectively placed fifth and sixth. Top-seeded Liverpool will play No. 15 PSG or No. 16 Benfica.","league, champions, the, mbappé, sporting, madrid, playoff, coach, amorim, flamingo, gvardiol, joško, weah, 61st, leg, ballon, barcola, bradley, timothy, city"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/merino-relieves-arsenals-attacking-woes-and-marmoush-scores-hat-trick-for-man-city,Merino relieves Arsenal's attacking woes and Marmoush scores hat trick for Man City,Associated Press,2025-02-16 20:44:40,"LONDON, FEBRUARY 16 After all the hand-wringing about Arsenal's lack of a striker, it turns out Mikel Merino may have been the unexpected solution. Merino eased Arsenal's attacking concerns with two late goals off the bench to secure a 2-0 win at relegation-threatened Leicester on Saturday that kept the Gunners in the Premier League title race. Manchester City has found a new scoring threat, too, even though it might be too late to get involved in the title fight. January signing Omar Marmoush netted a 14-minute hat trick in the first half of a 4-0 win over Newcastle that lifted Pep Guardiola's team into fourth place - only three points behind Nottingham Forest, which lost at Fulham 2-1. With Arsenal playing its first game since leading scorer Kai Havertz was ruled out for the season, its makeshift front three struggled to create chances until Merino - a central midfielder - went on in the 69th minute to play as a striker. The Spain international looked like a natural center forward as he quickly got on the end of two good crosses, heading home a pinpoint ball into the box from 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri in the 81st and then steering in a low assist from Leandro Trossard in the 87th. Arsenal tried and failed to sign a striker in the January transfer window even before Havertz joined a long list of injured forwards, leaving manager Mikel Arteta with no other option than to tell Merino to play up front. ""It was a bit of a surprise because it's the first time in my career I played that position,"" Merino said. ""But he told me go on as a striker and to make sure I go with my strengths. I think I solved it."" The win puts Arsenal within four points of leader Liverpool, which can restore the gap to seven points when it hosts Wolves at home on Sunday. Leicester remained rooted in the relegation zone, two points behind 17th-place Wolves. Merino and Nwaneri boost reputations Merino has struggled to carve out a clear role in midfield since joining Arsenal last summer. Perhaps he's found one up front instead. ""He has a sense of danger and great timing in the box,"" Arteta said. Nwaneri, meanwhile, produced another impressive performance to further boost his rapidly growing reputation. The teenager hit the woodwork twice, shaving the top of the crossbar from outside the area on the hour mark and then hitting the post with a fierce strike in the 76th. And after scoring two spectacular recent goals against Girona in the Champions League and Man City in the league, Nwaneri turned provider this time for Merino's breakthrough goal. ""He's an amazing player,"" Merino said about Nwaneri, a product of Arsenal's academy. ""I've been talking to him the whole season that I needed those kinds of balls when I'm arriving in the box. And he has such a wonderful left foot that he put it right on my head, so I could only score."" Marmoush shines for City Unlike Arsenal, City did bring in reinforcements in January and Marmoush showed just why the club spent a reported 70 million euros ($73 million) on the former Eintracht Frankfurt player. The Egypt forward netted his first goal for the club after running onto a long ball from goalkeeper Ederson and calmly lobbing it over Martin Dubravka. It was Ederson's sixth career Premier League assist, a record for goalkeepers. Marmoush netted his second just five minutes later after being teed up in the area by Ilkay Gundogan, and completed his hat trick in the 33rd after Savinho broke into the area and squared for the Egyptian to slot home. Substitute James McAtee completed the rout in the 84th, but there was a late scare for City as Erling Haaland went off after appearing to hurt his knee late on. Forest stumbles at Fulham Nottingham Forest's hopes of a surprising top-four finish took a blow as the team's pattern of inconsistency continued at Fulham. Forest's last two league results were a 5-0 loss at Bournemouth followed by a 7-0 win over Brighton and the team was largely outplayed by a Fulham team that had not won at home since early December. Calvin Bassey headed home the winner for Fulham after Forest's Chris Wood canceled out the opener by Emile Smith Rowe. Everton's resurgence under David Moyes continued as Carlos Alcaraz scored an 80th-minute winner to secure a 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace. That makes it four wins and a 2-2 draw against archrival Liverpool in Everton's last five league games after Moyes returned to the club last month. The team was up to 13th place, tied with Palace on 30 points. In other results, Aston Villa managed only 1-1 at home against relegation struggler Ipswich despite Ipswich defender Axel Tuanzebe being sent off for a second booking in the 40th. Ipswich took the lead through Liam Delap in the 56th and Ollie Watkins equalized. Brentford won at West Ham 1-0, while Bournemouth beat last-placed Southampton 3-1.","the, league, fulham, arsenal, forest, minute, relegation, nottingham, mikel, axel, tuanzebe, hat, merino, mcatee, trick, ethan, nwaneri, city, eintracht, havertz"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/mbappe-scores-first-hat-trick-for-real-madrid-as-atletico-draws,Mbappé scores first hat trick for Real Madrid as Atletico draws,Associated Press,2025-01-26 21:10:07,"BARCELONA, JANUARY 26 Kylian Mbappé tucked the ball under his shirt as he raised both hands to return the applause to the Real Madrid fans who savored his first hat trick for his new club. The France star had just led a 3-0 victory at struggling Valladolid that extended Madrid's lead of La Liga on Saturday, keeping it in position to retain the title just after the midway point of the campaign. Gone was the inconsistent play and missed penalties from Mbappé during his first months with Madrid following his move from Paris Saint-Germain. The France captain has started pouring in goals with back-to-back multi-goal games and has Madrid in pole position with Atletico Madrid and Barcelona stalled. ""I'm very happy for the hat trick but even happier for the win,"" Mbappé said in fluent Spanish. ""It was very important to win after Atletico's result because that gave us a bit more pressure to take advantage of it."" Madrid's fourth straight triumph in the league combined with Atletico Madrid's 1-1 draw with Villarreal let Carlo Ancelotti's side open a four-point gap over its city rival. Barcelona was in third place at 10 points back before hosting Valencia on Sunday. Madrid trailed then-leader Barcelona at one point, but since getting blown away in a 4-0 clasico debacle, it has found its stride and is in championship mode. ""My adaptation to the team is over. I feel comfortable on the field and you can see that from the way I am playing with my teammates,"" Mbappé said. ""This gives us confidence, but you know that until the 38th round this is not over. We have to keep winning because there is a long way to go."" No contest in Valladolid The game between the front-runner and the bottom side fit its billing as a mismatch. Valladolid could draw only one save from Thibaut Courtois in the opening moments. It was all Madrid the rest of the way even though Vinícius Júnior didn't play as he completed a two-game suspension. Mbappé swept in Madrid's first goal on the half-hour mark after a flowing team attack of quick passes to weave the ball through a packed Valladolid area that culminated in Jude Bellingham's assist for the France star. He made it a double in the 57th by finishing off a three-against-two counterattack after Federico Valverde intercepted a Valladolid pass. Mbappé took a pass by Rodrygo and rifled in a low strike from the left side of the box. Valladolid finished with 10 men after Mario Martín got a second booking in the 90th for a foul on Bellingham, sending Mbappé to the spot for his third. That made it four games in a row with a goal across all competitions for Mbappé. In La Liga, Mbappé has 15, second only to Robert Lewandowski's 16 for Barcelona. He also scored twice last weekend against Las Palmas in a 4-1 win. ""Mbappé is giving us a lot. He has found his rhythm over the last couple of months and that is obviously a boost for us,"" Ancelotti said. Valladolid was five points from safety. Atletico drops more points Atletico's stalemate with Villarreal came a week after a shock 1-0 loss at Leganes. Gerard Moreno, Villarreal's top scorer in club history, made it 120 goals for the Yellow Submarine in the 25th minute after the striker converted a penalty he earned when fouled by Reinildo. Atletico coach Diego Simeone rested Antoine Griezmann and midfielder Rodrigo de Paul for the first half. Then he made three changes at halftime, sending on De Paul and winger Samu Lino to kickstart his sluggish attack. The moves paid off as the hosts pressed Villarreal into its box, and Lino rammed in a 58th-minute equalizer. Simeone sent Griezmann on immediately after and the action stayed in Villarreal's area except for two chances for Villarreal's Ayoze Pérez, who replaced Gerard. But Griezmann's header that bounced just wide in the 86th was the closest Atletico came to snatching a winner. ""We played a good game at a very tough ground against a team with a deep bench that is fighting for the league. We are happy,"" Gerard said for a Villarreal that stayed in fifth place. Betis grabs late winner Cedric Bakambu headed in a stoppage-time winner to grab Real Betis a 1-0 victory at 10-man Mallorca. Mallorca had opportunities until Omar Mascarell received a direct red card for a studs-first tackle of Betis' Jesús Rodríguez in the 73rd. The win came while Betis secured a loan deal for forward Anthony from Manchester United. García sustains Espanyol Goalkeeper Joan García made three saves to deny Sevilla standout Dodi Lukebakio and help Espanyol grind out a 1-1 draw at Sevilla.","madrid, atletico, the, villarreal, cedric, lukebakio, dodi, joan, bakambu, ayoze, hat, valladolid, garcía, trick, france, griezmann, espanyol, betis, pérez, bellingham"

Mbappé continued his scoring streak with a brace as Madrid routed 10-man Las Palmas 4-1 on Sunday, prompting a big ovation at Santiago Bernabeu stadium for the France star who has struggled at times in his first season with the Spanish powerhouse. ""It's always a dream to get a standing ovation at this stadium,"" Mbappé said. ""I'm really happy, I've adapted to the team and I can play the way I want to. Everyone enjoys the team's game. All the Real Madrid players are leaders because it's the best team in the world. We have to be united because we have to win a lot of things. You always have to win at Real Madrid."" Mbappé now has scored four goals in his last four matches with Madrid. Brahim Díaz and Rodrygo also scored for Madrid as it overtook Atletico Madrid to begin the second half of the league season. Madrid is two points ahead of city rival Atletico, which on Saturday saw its record 15-game winning streak end in a 1-0 loss to Leganes. Madrid opened a seven-point lead over third-placed Barcelona, which drew 1-1 at Getafe on Saturday. ""It was an important match for us,"" Mbappé said. ""We knew what happened yesterday with Atletico's defeat and Barcelona's draw and we wanted to get the win. We started badly because we conceded an early goal, but the team's reaction was outstanding. We looked for space and played fast and with quality."" It was the second straight victory for Madrid after an embarrassing 5-2 loss to Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final in Saudi Arabia on Jan. 12. After Rodrygo was fouled, Mbappé converted an 18th-minute penalty kick on Sunday after the visitors had taken the lead through Fábio Silva one minute into the match at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium. Díaz put Madrid ahead in the 33rd and Mbappé added his second goal in the 36th after an assist by Rodrygo. Rodrygo scored his third goal in three matches in the 57th. Mbappé thought he had scored a hat trick near the end of the first half but his goal was disallowed for offside. He also hit the woodwork in first-half stoppage time. Jude Bellingham had a goal disallowed after video review in the second half. ""Mbappé's great form is helping us a lot,"" Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. ""Our work today was very good. We managed to get the right balance to handle the good moments and the difficult ones."" Las Palmas, sitting in 14th place and enduring a three-game losing streak across all competitions, had Benito Ramírez sent off for a high kick in the 64th. He initially was shown a yellow card but video review determined he deserved a red card. Defender David Alaba made his return to action after a long knee-injury layoff in the 77th. He hadn't played since December 2023. Madrid was without forward Vinícius Júnior because of a suspension. President Pérez As the only candidate, Florentino Pérez was reelected Madrid president on Sunday, securing his control of the club until 2029. Other results Earlier Sunday, fourth-place Athletic Bilbao won 2-1 at 13th-place Celta Vigo, while ninth-place Rayo Vallecano drew 1-1 at 10th-place Osasuna.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/champions-league-semifinals-barcelona-inter-revives-memories-of-2010-epic-and-arsenal-hosts-psg,Champions League semifinals: Barcelona-Inter revives memories of 2010 epic and Arsenal hosts PSG,Associated Press,2025-04-28 22:25:59,"MADRID, APRIL 28 The free-flowing attack of Barcelona comes up against the rugged, smothering defense of Inter Milan in the Champions League semifinals. Ring any bells? Go back to 2010 - when Lamine Yamal was not even 3 years old and Lionel Messi was close to his prime - and Camp Nou was the scene of one of the most memorable matches in Champions League history, between the same teams going head-to-head there again on Wednesday. Protecting a 3-1 lead from the first leg, Inter - coached at the time by Jose Mourinho - delivered a defensive masterclass against Pep Guardiola's Barcelona to survive with 10 men for more than an hour and lose just 1-0 to progress to the title match. Memories will come flooding back ahead of the rematch this week, especially with the two protagonists owning the same traits as 15 years ago. Barcelona is back in the Champions League semifinals for the first time since the 2018-19 season, on the back of by far the best attack in the new-look, 36-team league stage. With Yamal, Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski up front, Barca scored 28 goals in eight games - and has netted nine more goals in eliminating Benfica and Borussia Dortmund in the knockouts. Then there's Inter, the Italian champion, which conceded just once in eight games in the first stage and held on grimly to oust Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals. Inter won the 2010 final, against Bayern, for a third European Cup title so its run toward the final this season has echoes of that title-winning campaign. Arsenal vs. Paris Saint-Germain While the Barcelona-Inter Milan semifinal is awash with history, this one seems relatively fresh. Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain have met just three times in the Champions League and never in the knockout stage. One of those occasions was this season, when Arsenal won 2-0 at Emirates Stadium. And it's at home that the Gunners play on Tuesday in the first leg, hoping to reproduce the exploits that saw them beat defending champion Real Madrid in both legs in the quarterfinals. Their opponents, however, are aiming to eliminate an English opponent for the third straight round, after seeing off Liverpool and - less impressively - Aston Villa. With its ""galacticos"" - Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Messi - long gone, PSG is bidding to win a first Champions League title by going with talented up-and-coming players instead. Arsenal is also striving to become European champion for the first time, having not reached the semis since 2009.","league, the, madrid, barcelona, inter, champions, nou, title, milan, messi, champion, psg, european, stage, germain, pep, guardiola, saint, traits, gone"

Harry Kane is on the verge of winning the German league title with Bayern Munich and he could seal the deal on Saturday. After a career filled with individual top scorer awards and a host of runner-up medals - the Champions League, two European Championships, two English League Cups - it will be the first major trophy of Kane's career. A player who's often talked of putting the team above himself will finally get his reward. ""If it's me scoring a couple of goals, I'll take that for sure, but if it's someone else, I'm not going to worry too much,"" Kane said this month. ""All those kinds of individual achievements are what you think about after it's done."" Bayern has an eight-point lead over second-place Leverkusen with four games to play. The title could be confirmed Saturday if Bayern beats Mainz and Bayer Leverkusen doesn't beat Hoffenheim. ""No one deserves it more than him,"" Bayern's honorary president Uli Hoeness told broadcaster Sky on Wednesday. Why hasn't Kane won a trophy before? There's been bad luck along the way and Kane's trophy drought has sometimes brought mockery from opposition fans. At Tottenham, it often seemed like Kane and Son Heung-min were working wonders with a team which couldn't match rivals' budgets. Tottenham has been in sharp decline since its all-time top scorer left. There have been tough days, especially when Kane was limited by an ankle injury in Tottenham's 2-0 loss to Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League final, or England's penalty shootout loss to Italy at his home European Championship two years later. Kane could have won a trophy hours after signing for Bayern for a fee of potentially over 100 million pounds ($110 million at the time), but the team lost the German Super Cup on his debut. Months later, his club lost the league title to Leverkusen in a major upset. Things have improved this season under new coach Vincent Kompany but Bayern was knocked out of the German Cup by Leverkusen in December and eliminated from the Champions League by Inter Milan last week. Why does Bayern suit him so well? When Kane moved to Germany in 2023, it was a shock. He'd been at Tottenham since he was 11 and once seemed set to spend his entire career there. Kane is captain of the England national team, whose players typically tend to stay in the Premier League. He's also a big cricket fan, and was leaving that sport's birthplace for a country where few have ever heard of it. Kane settled in well after initial delays moving his family to Bavaria - his fourth child was born a week after he signed with Bayern - and has been taking German lessons. He fits Bayern well, too. Just like club great Robert Lewandowski, who left for Barcelona in 2022, Kane provides the center-forward focus which provides the structure for other players like Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise to operate around. Kane's putting up impressive scoring numbers. He scored his 60th Bundesliga goal in his 60th game last week, reaching that mark faster than anyone before him.","league, german, his, hoeness, uli, trophy, kane, kompany, 60th, championships, lewandowski, vincent, career, european, leverkusen, scorer, the, title, robert, runner"

The Germany captain has been with Bayern since 2015, winning eight Bundesliga titles and the Champions League in 2020. ""His hunger remains strong and that was clear to see again in the Champions League round of 16,"" chief executive Jan-Christian Dreesen said in a statement. ""His determination and commitment embody what FC Bayern stands for. He's going to build a bridge between our current generation and a new era."" The extension followed reports last month in Germany that Bayern withdrew an earlier contract offer to Kimmich as talks dragged on. Kimmich said he chose to extend because Bayern offered him ""the best environment to achieve my sporting goals ... I feel good here and I am not finished here yet."" Kimmich, who can also cover the right back role, has one goal and 10 assists in 39 games in all competitions this season. Kimmich is the latest Bayern player to commit to a new contract after attacking midfielder Jamal Musiala, wing back Alphonso Davies and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer signed new deals last month. Bayern still has decisions to make, as forwards Leroy Sané and Thomas Müller have contracts which are expiring at the end of the season.","bayern, munich, contract, dreesen, kimmich, musiala, joshua, christian, jamal, champions, jan, midfielder, müller, league, season, sané, assists, leroy, alphonso, 2029"

Spain was pegged back three times by the Netherlands in a 3-3 draw after extra time in the second leg for a 5-5 aggregate score. Barcelona midfielder Pedri scored the decisive penalty kick after Spain goalkeeper Unai Simón had saved Donyell Malen's effort as the shootout finished 5-4. France won the shootout by the same score against Croatia after leading 2-0 after 90 minutes to level the tie overall and force extra time, which saw no more goals scored. Dayot Upamecano scored the decisive spot kick after goalkeeper Mike Maignan brilliantly saved from Josip Stanisic. Germany scored three first-half goals against Italy but then held on grimly for a 3-3 draw to win 5-4 on aggregate. Giacomo Raspadori's penalty deep into second-half stoppage time of the second leg had put Italy within one goal of forcing extra time in Dortmund. Portugal beat Denmark 5-2 after extra time in Lisbon after losing the first leg 1-0. Francisco Trincão scored twice for Portugal late on, with Cristiano Ronaldo missing an early penalty. The semifinals begin on June 4 with Germany playing Portugal in Munich, followed on June 5 with France vs. Spain in Stuttgart. The final is on June 8. Mbappe's drought continues Kylian Mbappé's seventh game without a goal for France is his longest drought for the national team and he remains stuck on 48 goals. Michael Olise got France back into the tie when he curled in a 52nd-minute free kick for his first international goal, then set up Ousmane Dembélé 10 minutes from time to make it 2-2 on aggregate. Mbappé missed a good chance in extra time but held his nerve to score France's first penalty in the shootout at the Stade de France. Resilient Dutch push Spanish all the way Mikel Oyarzabal's early penalty put Spain ahead in Valencia but Memphis Depay equalized from the spot in the 54th minute. Oyarzabal grabbed his second goal midway through the second half following a counterattack but defender Ian Maatsen's left-footed strike sent the game into extra time. Barcelona star Lamine Yamal put the Spanish ahead again in the 103rd minute with a neat finish, but midfielder Xavi Simons equalized as the Dutch took Spain to penalties. Germany stylish, then sloppy Joshua Kimmich netted from the penalty spot after 30 minutes for Germany and Bayern Munich teammate Jamal Musiala added the second goal six minutes later in unusual circumstances. Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma had just made a fine save from a header. As he was remonstrating with his defense, Kimmich played a short corner to Musiala and he clipped the ball into the net with Donnarumma stranded. Striker Tim Kleindienst put the Germans 3-0 up and Moise Kean pulled two second-half goals back for Italy before late drama. Ronaldo's soft penalty not costly Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in men's soccer, but he saw his tame sixth-minute spot-kick saved by Kasper Schmeichel, who guessed the right way and gathered easily. Portugal took the lead close to halftime when defender Joachim Andersen clumsily headed into his own net from a corner. Rasmus Kristensen headed in the right way for the equalizer in the 56th, getting his first Denmark goal in the process. Ronaldo made it international goal No. 136 when he squeezed the ball in from close range but Christian Eriksen equalized for 2-2 moments later when he turned in a cross, only for Trincão to put the game into extra time and then score again. Goncalo Ramos added the fifth goal. Denmark won the first leg 1-0. Maldini's first start Daniel Maldini started his first match for Italy, 23 years after his father Paolo Maldini's last game for the national team. Cesare Maldini, Daniel's grandfather, also played for Italy. Greece and Turkey cruise, Lukaku saves Belgium Veteran striker Romelu Lukaku scored two late goals as Belgium beat Ukraine 3-0 to stay in League A after losing the first leg 3-1. Greece was promoted to League A after overturning a 1-0 deficit with a resounding 3-0 win in Scotland, with 17-year-old midfielder Konstantinos Karetsas among the scorers. Hakan Çalhanoğlu's penalty sent Turkey on the way to a 3-0 victory in Hungary and a 6-1 aggregate victory to gain promotion to League A. Hungary and Scotland dropped down to League B, while Ireland stayed in League B after beating Bulgaria 2-1 for a 4-2 aggregate win. Elsewhere, Vedat Muriqi's hat trick in a 3-1 win at Iceland sent Kosovo into Group B with a 5-2 overall victory.","penalty, maldini, minute, the, goal, ronaldo, league, kick, goals, aggregate, half, second, his, spot, raspadori, karetsas, joachim, andersen, donnarumma, muriqi"

Davies' season seems to be over after Bayern said he would be out for ""several months"" with a torn cruciate ligament in his right knee. The left back went off injured while playing in Canada's 2-1 win over the United States in the CONCACAF Nations League. Bayern predicted central defender Upamecano will be out for ""several weeks"" with a problem in his left knee following his return from playing both legs of France's quarterfinal win over Croatia in the UEFA Nations League. ""In international breaks there is unfortunately always a danger that players come back injured, and this time it has hit us especially hard,"" Bayern's board member for sport Max Eberl said. ""The absences of Alphonso Davies and Dayot Upamecano weigh heavily on FC Bayern."" Eberl said the team would ""pull even closer together now"" to make up for losing Davies and Upamecano. ""The quality is there to keep on pursuing our big goals."" The injuries could mean Bayern relies more on central defender Kim Min-jae, who returned to training Monday after an Achilles tendon injury forced him to miss international games for South Korea. It could also mean more game time for Bayern's fringe players like center back Eric Dier, left back Raphael Guerreiro and versatile defender Hiroki Ito.

The visitor made a courageous start and went close to scoring when captain Jackson Irvine's header was deflected onto the crossbar. Then Bayern pounced on a mistake with Michael Olise crossing for Kane's league-leading 22nd goal in the 17th minute. ""The difference was Bayern didn't give us any gifts and we unfortunately gave (gifts),"" Elias Saad said. He equalized in the 27th when Manolis Saliakas was given enough space on the right to cross for the Tunisia forward. Sané restored Bayern's lead in the 53rd with a low shot across goal after being sent through by Olise, then scored again to seal the win. Lars Ritzka pulled one back for St. Pauli in stoppage time after Bayern defender Hiroki Ito was unable to play the final minutes. It's the latest injury blow to Bayern's defense with Alphonso Davies and Dayot Upamecano out with knee injuries. ""It was a deserved win, just we made it unnecessarily exciting at the end with the goal we conceded,"" Bayern sporting director Christoph Freund said. The victory ended Bayern's two-game winless streak in the Bundesliga, but coach Vincent Kompany will face questions about his team's vulnerabilities in defense - particularly with the shortages he faces there. Bayern faces Inter Milan in the Champions League quarterfinals on April 8. Frankfurt closing on CL qualification Mario Götze, whose goal won the 2014 World Cup final, scored the winner for Eintracht Frankfurt to beat Stuttgart 1-0 and boost its Champions League qualification prospects. The former Germany star's 70th-minute goal lifted Frankfurt to third place with a five-point cushion over Borussia Mönchengladbach as it bids to finish among the top four and qualify for Europe's top competition. Stuttgart goalkeeper Alexander Nübel got his fingertips to Hugo Larsson's shot to push it onto the post, but it fell kindly for Götze to break the deadlock. Stuttgart's Ameen Al-Dakhil was sent off in the 57th for a foul on Hugo Ekitiké as the last defender. The French forward would have been through on goal. Gladbach wins European qualification duel Alassane Plea's header after the break was enough for Gladbach to beat Leipzig 1-0 and move above the visiting team to fifth, two points behind Mainz, which visits Borussia Dortmund on Sunday. Leipzig can drop to seventh, outside the European qualification places, if Freiburg gets a point against Union Berlin on Sunday. Also on Saturday, Heidenheim boosted its survival hopes with a 1-0 win at Wolfsburg, Hoffenheim drew with Augsburg 1-1, and Werder Bremen won at bottom side Holstein Kiel 3-0. Defending champion Bayer Leverkusen temporarily cut Bayern's lead to three points with a 3-1 win over Bochum on Friday.

The New Zealand ""All Whites"" reached the World Cup for the third time after qualifying in Spain in 1982 and South Africa in 2010. They join hosts Canada, the United States and Mexico and Japan, which last week became the first team to qualify for the 48-team tournament. New Caledonia still has a chance to qualify through a six-team inter-continental playoff involving teams from the Asian, African, North and Central American and South American confederations. New Zealand had a setback when its captain, Nottingham Forest striker Chris Wood, was forced from the field with a hip injury in the 53rd minute with the score still 0-0. Wood is the focus of the New Zealand attack, scoring three headed goals in New Zealand's 7-0 semifinal win over Fiji on Friday. Up stepped an unlikely star in Wood's absence. In the 62nd Michael Boxall, the 36-year-old center back from Minnesota United, scored his first goal in 55 international appearances to finally break the deadlock. Boxall met Francis de Vries' corner at the far post and headed it home. Four minutes later the 17-year international veteran Kosta Barbarouses, who replaced Wood, ran onto Tim Payne's pass and chipped the ball over Nyikeine to make it 2-0. Finally, Denmark-based Elijah Just scored from Barbarouses' assist in the 80th to clinch New Zealand's place at the World Cup. ""When the goal went in I think I was a bit more relieved than anything,"" Boxall said. ""Fair play to New Caledonia, they made it pretty hard work for us. ""Everyone's reaction when the ball finally went into the back of the net was incredible."" New Caledonia shocked pundits when it held New Zealand scoreless at halftime, mostly through the extraordinary efforts of goalkeeper Rocky Nyikeine. New Zealand threatened at set pieces from which they looked for Wood, who has scored 18 goals in the English Premier League this season Wood missed with a header in the 18th minute and had a low shot saved by Nyikeine in the 31st. Oceania is the smallest of FIFA's six confederations, made up of 11 full member nations, mostly small island states from South Pacific. After Australia moved to the Asian Football Confederation from Oceania following the the 2006 World Cup, New Zealand, ranked No. 89 and with a population of 5.2 million, became the largest and highest-ranked nation in the confederation. New Caledonia, with a population of 280,000, is ranked 152. This edition for the first time the Oceania qualifying series winner was granted direct entry to the World Cup, without having to face an inter-continental playoff. That bonus came with the expansion of the tournament to 48. In 1982 New Zealand played 15 matches and traveled 55,000 miles in its qualifying campaign. In 2010, it qualified after a two-game series with Bahrain. New Caledonia's ""Les Cagous"", most of whom are amateurs, had to overcome political unrest in their homeland to qualify for the Oceania finals. Violent protests against voting reforms claimed the lives of 13 people in the French-speaking island nation and disrupted the New Caledonia team's qualifying campaign. ""I love the way my team played, the attitude on the field. Unfortunately the result was not on our side,"" New Caledonia manager Johann Sidaner said.","the, caledonia, zealand, oceania, new, confederation, qualifying, wood, nyikeine, barbarouses, confederations, cagous, elijah, payne, sidaner, vries, les, johann, rocky, cup"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/argentina-secures-a-world-cup-spot-and-then-celebrates-it-with-a-4-1-victory-over-archrival-brazil,Argentina secures a World Cup spot and then celebrates it with a 4-1 victory over archrival Brazil,Associated Press,2025-03-26 23:09:14,"BUENOS AIRES, MARCH 26 Defending champion Argentina celebrated throughout Tuesday as the team secured its place at the 2026 World Cup hours before an historic 4-1 win over archrival Brazil. Bolivia's failure to beat Uruguay meant Argentina had enough cushion in South American qualifying to secure one of the continent's six direct spots for the 48-team World Cup set to be co-hosted next year by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. After Bolivia's 0-0 draw with Uruguay at El Alto, about 85,000 raucous Argentina fans kicked off the festivities at the Monumental de Nunez Stadium despite the absence of Lionel Messi. They were chanting into the night in Buenos Aires, now more confident their team can defend the World Cup title. For Brazil, its worst deficit in South American World Cup qualifying history compounded pressure on coach Dorival Júnior. Brazil is in fourth place in South American qualifying with 21 points, 10 behind Argentina but only two behind second-place Ecuador, which was held to a 0-0 draw by Chile. Third-place Uruguay and fifth-place Paraguay also have 21 points, and Colombia is one point behind them in sixth. Seventh-place Venezuela has 15 points after a 1-0 win over 9th-place Peru. Brazil was missing three regular starters - goalkeeper Alisson, defender Gabriel Magalhães and midfielder Bruno Guimarães - and wasn't really competitive from start to finish. It's the first time Argentina has won both matches against Brazil in a World Cup qualifying tournament. The home victory was also Argentina's first against the Brazilians since qualifying for the 2006 World Cup. Argentina has led South American qualifying from the start, with few hiccups and major away wins at Brazil and Uruguay. But coach Lionel Scaloni has not fielded 37-year-old Messi in several games, which still raises doubts on whether the star will play at the World Cup next year. Messi has an injury to his adductor and was not included in Argentina's squad for the two latest matches. ARGENTINE FLAIR, BRAZILIAN DESPAIR Striker Julián Álvarez said Argentina's big win ""is historic because of the rival, the context, what was said, the great match we played and because we are qualified to the World Cup."" ""Very humbly we did our work,"" he said. Argentina scored its two first goals in only 12 minutes of play, both thanks to accurate passing and some clumsy Brazilian defending. Alvarez netted the first in the 4th minute after Marquinhos, Murillo and Guilherme Arana failed to reach the ball. The Argentina striker shot between the legs of goalkeeper Bento from close range. Argentina scored again eight minutes later with Enzo Fernández, once again from close range after a low cross by Gonzalo Molina. Brazil got one back via Matheus Cunha in the 26th after a mistake by Cristian Romero, who lost the ball to the Brazilian by the edge of the box. Enzo Fernandez found Alexis Mac Allister bursting into the penalty box unmarked 11 minutes later to make it 3-1 to Argentina. During the break, Brazil sought to get some grip by boosting its presence in the midfield with Joao Gomes and the substitution of Murillo and striker Rodrygo. But it was to no avail, with Giuliano Simeone scoring for Argentina in the 71st after four Brazilian defenders failed to block a low cross in front of their goal. ""Everything we planned, from the first minute of play, did not happen,"" Brazil's coach told a news conference. ""Argentina was much better in every way. I apologize to Brazil fans, we expected something very different from what we showed. It was a very difficult night for us."" Brazil captain Marquinhos said all players should have done better in Buenos Aires. ""It isn't only about Dorival,"" Marquinhos said. ""This is not only the coach's fault, it is the players too. We need to have our heads in the right place. They (Argentina) also had tough times before and they overcame it. We can do it too."" Ednaldo Rodrigues, the president of Brazil's soccer confederation, said he'd speak to the domestic media Wednesday, but didn't reply whether Dorival Júnior was going to be his main topic. Argentine players celebrated with their fans, asking for ""a minute of silence"" for Brazil. Scaloni's team has not lost to their rivals since 2019. The next South American World Cup qualifiers will be played in June.","cup, the, brazil, world, argentina, place, buenos, scaloni, aires, argentine, qualifying, striker, lionel, dorival, brazilian, magalhães, american, coach, enzo, álvarez"

Thiago Almada scored the winner with a powerful curled shot from the edge of the box, putting the defending champions one point away from its direct spot in the tournament next year. Argentina leads the round robin competition with 28 points after 13 matches, and could secure its place with a home draw with Brazil on Tuesday. The team of coach Lionel Scaloni already has 15 points ahead of 7th-placed Bolivia, with only five rounds to the end of the competition. The last time the two soccer powerhouses clashed, Argentina won 1-0 at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. Earlier, Ecuador defeated Venezuela 2-1 and moved into second place in South American World Cup, edging close to reaching the tournament once again. Brazil is third with 21 points, one ahead of Uruguay and Paraguay. Colombia, with 19 points, has the sixth position. The top six teams will secure direct berths to the tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The seventh-place team among the 10 of the region will still have a chance to qualify through an international playoff. No Messi, no problem Argentina had to accommodate key absences beyond Messi. Lautaro Martínez, Lisandro Martínez, and Rodrigo De Paul did not play in Montevideo. So coach Lionel Scaloni gave a place to Giuliano Simeone in the starting lineup, with Julián Álvarez and Thiago Almada up front. Uruguay, playing in a full Centenario Stadium against its archrival, took the initiative and had the clearest chances in the first half. But Argentina managed to hold its ground and started getting the better opportunities after halftime. Almada's goal in the 68th minute, after Argentina had wasted several other opportunities in front of goalkeeper Sergio Rochet, still didn't push Uruguay forward as Marcelo Bielsa's team finished the match with only four shots on goal. ""I was a little anxious, very willing to play and to show why I was making the squad,"" said Almada, a world champion with Argentina in 2022. ""Now we have to rest and wait for this match against Brazil, they will rest one more day than us."" Argentina's Nico González will miss the match against Brazil. He was sent off after a challenge against Nahitan Nández in injury time. Brazil has selection problems of its own for Tuesday's match at the Monumental de Nunez Stadium, as starting goalkeeper Alisson, defender Gabriel Magalhães and midfielder Bruno Guimarães are all ineligible to play. Argentina coach Scaloni celebrated his team's performance despite so many absences. ""We made a complete match, we absorbed the pressure. When we had to play, we did it. And when we had to defend, we did it too,"" Scaloni said in a press conference. ""I am happy not only for our win, but also for how the team behaves."" Uruguay will have a chance to recover against Bolivia on Tuesday. If the Bolivians fail to beat the Uruguayans, Argentina will qualify for the World Cup even if it loses against Brazil. Valencia brace Enner Valencia, Ecuador's all-time top goal-scorer, added another two to his tally on Friday. The striker broke through the Venezuelan defense in the 39th minute and scored with a powerful right-footed shot from an acute angle. In the first minute of the second half, he added the second after a run on the left flank ended in a classy poach over goalkeeper Rafael Romo. Valencia could have had a third from the spot in the 69th but he missed it. Jhonder Cádiz scored for Venezuela in injury time. Venezuela has not won for nine straight games and remains in eighth place. The team still has a chance of qualifying for the first time in history. Ecuador started the competition with a three-point deficit due to fielding Byron Castillo, who was actually Colombian and ineligible to play in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. Now it is close to returning to the tournament in with a steady, confident squad. Ecuador will travel to play 10th-placed Chile on Tuesday. Venezuela will play host to 9th-placed Peru.","the, cup, scaloni, world, lionel, almada, romo, centenario, montevideo, minute, match, rochet, gonzález, bielsa, magalhães, place, marcelo, sergio, martínez, nico"

""A proposal to analyze a 64-team FIFA World Cup to celebrate the centenary of the FIFA World Cup in 2030 was spontaneously raised by a FIFA Council member in the 'miscellaneous' agenda item near the end of the FIFA Council meeting,"" soccer's governing body said Thursday, one day after the meeting. ""The idea was acknowledged as FIFA has a duty to analyze any proposal from one of its Council members,"" FIFA said about the remote online meeting. It was suggested by the elected delegate from Uruguay, Ignacio Alonso, two people familiar with the move told The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussion was confidential. Uruguay was the original World Cup host - and trophy winner - in 1930 and is scheduled to host one game at the centenary tournament. The first 48-team tournament will be played next year in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The 2030 World Cup is already set to be the most sprawling edition with six host nations spread across three continents. South American soccer body CONMEBOL agreed in 2023 to a FIFA-backed plan for Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay to have one game each to open the tournament before it moves to the main co-hosts Spain, Portugal and Morocco. FIFA gave all six hosts automatic places in the tournament lineup and the deal was seen as a win in soccer politics for CONMEBOL's Paraguayan president Alejandro Dominguez. Expanding to 64 teams likely would guarantee all 10 CONMEBOL member countries a place in a bigger tournament. Venezuela is the only one that has never qualified for a World Cup. Having 64 teams if FIFA approves the move should create a tournament of 128 games - also double the number of the 64-game, 32-team format that was played from 1998 through 2022. Adding 16 teams - beyond the 48 teams of the 2026 edition - would send hundreds more players to the World Cup at a time when player unions have criticized a relentless expansion of games and competitions without consulting their members. However, FIFA president Gianni Infantino has enthusiastically supported adding to its tournament portfolio that raises revenue and gives more teams the chance to qualify, citing a need to develop soccer globally. Some World Cup sponsors, including Coca-Cola, Adidas and Wanda, bought rights to the 2030 World Cup at least a decade ago when they were paying for an expected 64-game event. FIFA gave no timetable for a review of the proposal and possible decision. Paraguay's capital Asuncion hosts the next FIFA Congress of 211 member federation in May.","fifa, cup, world, the, 2030, tournament, conmebol, centenary, proposal, edition, 64, soccer, gianni, infantino, council, dominguez, teams, alejandro, american, member"

Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well. The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Trump. It marked Trump's first call with a foreign leader since his inauguration Monday. ""The crown prince affirmed the kingdom's intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,"" the report said. The readout did not elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which once was the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports as well. Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment. The White House on Thursday issued a statement acknowledging the call, saying the two leaders ""discussed efforts to bring stability to the Middle East, bolster regional security and combat terrorism."" ""Additionally, they discussed the kingdom of Saudi Arabia's international economic ambitions over the next four years as well as trade and other opportunities to increase the mutual prosperity of the United State and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" the statement said, without elaborating. The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday. On Monday after his inauguration, Trump talked about possibly heading to the kingdom again as his first foreign trip, as he did in 2017. ""The first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but ... I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,"" Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. ""If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 - we'll up it for all the inflation - I think I'd probably go."" On a potential trip to Saudi Arabia, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told journalists Thursday: ""I'm not aware of any plans at this time."" Trump's 2017 visit to the kingdom set in motion a yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, including the kingdom. Trump maintained close relations with Saudi Arabia, even after Prince Mohammed was implicated in the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The kingdom also had been talking for years with the Biden administration about a wider deal to diplomatically recognize Israel in exchange for U.S. defense protections and other support. The $600 billion pledge, which dwarves the gross domestic product of many nations, also comes as the kingdom faces budgetary pressures of its own. Global oil prices remain depressed years after the height of the coronavirus pandemic, affecting the kingdom's revenues. Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed also wants to continue his $500 billion project at NEOM, a new city in Saudi Arabia's western desert on the Red Sea. It also will need to build tens of billions of dollars' worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of it hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.","saudi, crown, prince, kingdom, the, arabia, trump, trip, oil, billion, leavitt, khashoggi, karoline, mohammed, press, fifa, worth, bin, call, white"

Speaking by video from the White House to the annual summit in Davos, Switzerland, on his third full day in office, Trump ran through his flurry of executive actions since his swearing-in and claimed that he had a ""massive mandate"" from the American people to bring change. He laid out a carrot-and-stick approach for private investment in the U.S. ""Come make your product in America and we will give you among the lowest taxes as any nation on earth,"" Trump said. ""But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply, you will have to pay a tariff - differing amounts - but a tariff, which will direct hundreds of billions of dollars and even trillions of dollars into our treasury to strengthen our economy and pay down debt under the Trump administration."" Trump, who spoke Wednesday to Saudi Arabia's crown prince, also said Thursday that the kingdom wants to invest $600 billion in the U.S. but that he would ask Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to increase it to $1 trillion. The remark drew some laughter from the crowd in the hall in Davos. Introducing Trump, Davos founder Klaus Schwab told the new president that his return and his agenda have ""been at the focus of our discussions this week."" He invited Trump to speak at the summit in person next year. Trump, who promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war before taking office, said it remained a top priority, but he offered few clues for how he would do so. ""One thing very important: I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon and get that war ended,"" Trump told the Davos audience. ""We really have to stop that war. That war is horrible"" Earlier in his address to the forum, Trump laid blame on the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries for keeping the price of oil too high for much of the nearly three-year war. Oil sales are the economic engine driving Moscow's economy. ""If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,"" Trump said. He added about OPEC+, ""They are very responsible to a certain extent for what's taking place."" Oil prices have more recently slumped due to weaker-than-expected demand from China as well as increased production from countries such as Brazil and Argentina that aren't in OPEC+. In the largest hall in the Davos Congress Center - seating capacity 850 - Trump's appearance drew nearly standing-room-only turnout. The crowd included diplomats, human rights advocates, academics and business leaders. His return to the White House and his barrage of executive orders have been the talk of the town this week in the snowy Swiss town. At times, Trump drew a few groans, like when he derided ""inept"" members of the outgoing Biden administration. The loudest laughter came when WEF President Borge Brende said Trump had called Chinese President Xi Jinping over the weekend, and the U.S. leader quickly corrected him: ""He called me."" The reaction from the audience was mixed. Some attendees enjoyed the attention from Trump. ""I was impressed (by) the force of his convictions and by what he said. I don't share his opinion on many topics, but I thought he was well prepared and knew who he was talking to,"" said Benedict Fontanet, a Swiss lawyer. Others cringed at the ""America First"" ambitions of Trump yet again. ""It's absolute determination to 'make America great again' at the expense of the rest of the world,"" said Agnes Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International. ""It's favoring American workers at the expense of workers everywhere ... There's nothing, nothing about the rest of the world.""","the, davos, crown, his, oil, prince, president, trump, trillions, borge, schwab, laughter, brende, klaus, forum, war, address, swiss, tariff, hall"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/trump-heads-back-to-davos-this-time-virtually-for-elite-world-economic-forum-gathering,"Trump heads back to Davos, this time virtually, for elite World Economic Forum gathering",Associated Press,2025-01-23 21:13:14,"DAVOS, JANUARY 23 Donald Trump is coming back to Davos. This time, virtually. The freshly reinaugurated U.S. president is to speak Thursday to an international audience for the first time after returning to the White House three days earlier, with a speech and question-and-answer by video conference at the World Economic Forum's annual event. The fourth day of the annual gathering also has featured Javier Milei, the brash Argentine president, and Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who became interim leader of Bangladesh after the longtime president was driven from power during a public uprising. Business and tech whizzes will get their turns too. Dario Amodei of Anthropic, maker of artificial intelligence model Claude, and chief AI scientist Yann LeCun of Mark Zuckerberg's Meta will tackle the future of technology. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen will take up energy transition with the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol. A day earlier, a small group of pro-environment demonstrators staged a rally in which one placard read ""Sun Baby Sun"" - a retort in favor of solar power to Trump's call for the United States to ""drill, baby, drill"" fossil fuels earlier this week. Here's a look at some of the main events Thursday in Davos: Trump shows, just not in-person Trump is no stranger to the gathering of CEOs, startup visionaries, government leaders, world-class academics and other elites who meet in the snowy Swiss town of Davos each January. He came twice during his first term. His barrage of executive orders including calling for a U.S. pullout from the Paris climate deal, creating a new agency to collect tariffs and a pause in a TikTok ban have fed the chatter in the Davos Congress Center corridors. His promotion of a business joint venture that could invest up to $500 billion in infrastructure tied to AI has drawn plaudits from tech-oriented executives in Davos, even if Trump ally and multibillionaire Elon Musk - who is not on hand - scoffed on his X social media platform that the partners "" don't actually have the money."" Trump also drew praise from the U.N. chief. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, during a question-and-answer session after his speech a day earlier that focused on the threats of global warming and ungoverned AI, credited Trump's efforts before the inauguration to help win a ceasefire in Gaza. ""The negotiations were dragging, dragging, dragging. And then, all of a sudden, it happened,"" Guterres said as he also praised efforts by Qatar and Turkey. ""I think there was a large contribution of robust diplomacy of - at the time - the president-elect of the United States."" Argentina's Milei rails against 'wokeism' Milei launched a diatribe against what he called the ills of ""wokeism"" and described a global struggle between libertarians - like him - and left-wing progressives. He slammed social welfare, feminism, identity politics and the fight against climate change. ""I have come here to tell you that while our battle is not won, there is now hope that our moral duty has been reborn as well as our historic responsibility to dismantle the ideological structure of this sick wokeism,"" Milei said. Trump and Musk are among leaders forming an alliance ""of all the nations that want to be free,"" he said. ""The common denominator for the countries that are failing is the mental virus of woke ideology,"" he said. ""It is the great pandemic of our time that needs to be cured. It is the cancer that must be cut out."" Pope Francis envoy evokes 'fraternity' In a message read by his envoy to Davos, Pope Francis praised technological advancements but warned about the dangers AI could pose to ""human dignity and fraternity."" ""When used correctly, AI assists the human person in fulfilling his or her vocation in freedom and responsibility,"" Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana said, reading the message. ""AI must be ordered to the human person and become part of efforts to achieve greater justice, more extensive fraternity, and a more humane order of social relations, which are more valuable than advances in the technical field,"" he added. The pontiff also expressed concerns about AI's effect ""on the growing crisis of truth in the public forum,"" Turkson said. NATO's Rutte urges more support for Ukraine Anxiety in Europe has grown that Trump might seek to quickly end Russia's war in Ukraine through talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin - on terms that might be unfavorable to Kyiv. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, speaking at a breakfast on the sidelines of the forum hosted by Ukrainian tycoon Victor Pinchuk, urged Ukraine's Western backers to keep up their support nearly three years into the war. ""If we got a bad deal, it would only mean that we will see the president of Russia high-fiving with the leaders from North Korea, Iran and China and we cannot accept that,"" Rutte said. ""That would be geopolitically a big, big mistake."" Richard Grenell, Trump's nominee as envoy for special missions, said by video from Los Angeles that Trump faced ""a terrible mess"" and ""not a lot of great choices"" in efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war. ""President Trump is somebody who has a credible threat and has already made clear that he's going to pressure both sides to end this. He's focused on trying to stop the killing,"" the envoy-designate said. Putting more pressure on Putin - economic or military - remained a ""legitimate option"" for Trump, Grenell said. ""I would say just give President Trump a little time,"" he said.","the, forum, trump, baby, wokeism, president, davos, sun, rutte, milei, envoy, lecun, pinchuk, turkson, mark, yann, ursula, von, zuckerberg, der"

The magazine announced the actor-writer-director as its pick Tuesday night during ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."" Krasinski starred in ""The Office"" before launching the ""Quiet Place"" franchise and leading the action series ""Jack Ryan."" He joked in an interview with the magazine that he's hoping his wife, fellow actor Emily Blunt, makes good on a promise to plaster the cover as wallpaper at their home. He takes the mantle from last year's honoree, Patrick Dempsey. Krasinski, 45, told People that his immediate reaction to the honor was ""just immediate blackout, actually. Zero thoughts."" He added that he thought he might be getting pranked. He burst to fame playing the floppy-haired, lanky Jim on the U.S. version of the mockumentary ""The Office,"" and transitioned into the clean-cut, muscular action star on Amazon's ""Jack Ryan,"" playing the Tom Clancy character previously portrayed by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck on the big screen. He also co-wrote, directed and starred in ""A Quiet Place,"" which has grown into a three-film franchise, and created the short-lived but immensely popular pandemic-era webseries ""Some Good News."" Earlier this year, he debuted his sixth directorial effort, ""IF,"" a film about imaginary friends that also featured Blunt. The couple have two daughters together. Krasinski told People in the issue that's on newsstands on Friday that the honor is likely to result in more than just jokes at home. ""I think it's going to make me do more household chores,"" he quipped. Now in its 40th year, the first Sexiest Man Alive was Mel Gibson. Other past recipients include Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John F. Kennedy Jr., David Beckham, Michael B. Jordan, John Legend, Dwayne Johnson, Paul Rudd and Pierce Brosnan.","magazine, sexiest, quiet, the, blunt, clancy, emily, john, franchise, ryan, man, jack, office, tom, angeles, actor, los, mel, gibson, baldwin"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/george-foreman-the-fearsome-heavyweight-who-became-a-beloved-champion-dies-at-76,"George Foreman, the fearsome heavyweight who became a beloved champion, dies at 76",Associated Press,2025-03-22 19:56:06,"George Foreman became the heavyweight champion of the world in his 20s, only to lose his belt to Muhammad Ali in perhaps the most memorable fight in boxing history. A full 20 years later in 1994, the 45-year-old Foreman became the oldest man to win the heavyweight championship, throwing one perfect combination to steal Michael Moorer's title in an epic upset. Few fighters ever had more big moments than Big George Foreman - and even after he finally left the ring, he was only getting started. The fearsome heavyweight, who lost the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" to Ali before his inspiring second act as a surprising champion and a successful businessman, died Friday night. Foreman was 76. Foreman's family announced his death on social media, not saying how or where he died. ""A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father and a proud grand- and great-grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility and purpose,"" his family wrote. ""A humanitarian, an Olympian and two-time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected. A force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name- for his family."" A native Texan, Foreman began his boxing career as an Olympic gold medalist who inspired fear and awe as he climbed to the peak of the heavyweight division by stopping Joe Frazier in 1973. His formidable aura evaporated only a year later when Ali pulled off one of the most audacious victories in boxing history in Zaire, baiting and taunting Foreman into losing his belt. Foreman left the sport a few years later, but returned after a 10-year absence and a self-described religious awakening. The middle-aged fighter then pulled off one of the most spectacular knockouts in boxing history, flooring Moorer - 19 years his junior - with a surgical right hand and claiming Moorer's two heavyweight belts. Foreman's 20 years is easily the longest gap between heavyweight title reigns. ""His contribution to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten,"" former heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, said on X, formerly Twitter, as he expressed his condolences. Foreman's transformation into an inspirational figure was complete, and he fought only four more times - finishing 76-5 with 68 knockouts - before moving onto his next career as a genial businessman, pitchman and occasional actor. Outside the ring, he was best known as the face of the George Foreman Grill, which launched in the same year as his victory over Moorer. The simple cooking machine sold more than 100 million units and made him much wealthier than his sport ever did. ""George was a great friend to not only myself, but to my entire family,"" Top Rank president Bob Arum said. ""We've lost a family member and are absolutely devastated."" In the first chapter of his boxing career, Foreman was nothing like the smiling grandfather who hawked his grills on television to great success. Foreman dabbled in petty crime while growing up in Houston's Fifth Ward, but changed his life through boxing. He made the U.S. Olympic team in 1968 and won gold in Mexico City as a teenager, stopping a 29-year-old opponent in a star-making performance. Foreman rose to the pinnacle of the pro game over the next five years, but was also perceived as an aloof, unfriendly athlete, both through his demeanor and through the skewed racial lenses of the time. Jim Lampley, the veteran boxing broadcaster who worked alongside Foreman for many years at HBO, told The Associated Press on Friday night that Foreman's initial demeanor was an attempt by his camp to emulate Sonny Liston, the glowering heavyweight champ of the 1960s. ""At some point somewhere along the way, he realized that wasn't him,"" Lampley said. Foreman stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosell's iconic call: ""Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!"" Foreman defended his belt against Ken Norton before accepting the fight with Ali in the now-immortal bout staged in Africa by promoter Don King. Ali put on a tactical masterclass against Foreman, showing off the ""rope-a-dope"" strategy that frustrated and infuriated the champion. Foreman was eventually knocked down for the first time in his career, and the fight was stopped in the eighth round. Foreman told the BBC in 2014 that he took the fight almost out of charity to Ali, who he suspected to be broke. ""I said I was going to go out there and kill him, and people said, 'Please, don't say you're going to kill Muhammad,'"" Foreman said. ""So I said, 'OK, I'll just beat him down to the ground.' That's how easy I thought the fight would be."" Exhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade preaching and working with kids in Houston after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s with a plan to defy time through frequent ring appearances, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a surprisingly competitive title fight in 1991. Three years later, Foreman got in the ring with Moorer in Las Vegas, more for his celebrity than for his perceived ability to beat Moorer. The champion appeared to win the first nine rounds rather comfortably, with Foreman unable to land his slower punches. But Foreman came alive in the 10th, hurting Moorer before slipping in the short right hand that sent Moorer to the canvas in earth-shaking fashion. Lampley, who was calling the fight, named his upcoming autobiography - which includes a prologue about Foreman - after his famous call of that moment: ""It Happened!"" Foreman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. Much of the world soon knew Foreman as both a lovable friend and a ferocious fighter. ""He started performing as this pitchman, this product pitchman with the big, ever-present giant grin on his face,"" Lampley recalled. ""When I was working with him, people would say, 'George is a big clown.' And I would say, 'Well, you can call him a clown, but he's actually a genius. He may be the greatest genius I've ever met.' And people would say, 'Well, genius, what do you mean?' I'd say, 'Well, check the bank account. If that isn't proof enough, I don't know what is.' So, he was a genius. He was a human genius."" Foreman briefly starred in a sitcom called ""George"" in the 1990s, and he even appeared on the reality singing competition ""The Masked Singer"" in 2022. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023. Foreman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman. ""Legendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,"" WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on social media. ""His memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace.""","foreman, his, heavyweight, the, george, boxing, champion, moorer, pitchman, genius, years, grandfather, olympic, big, year, friend, 30s, awakening, cosell, rumble"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/entertainment/death-of-south-korean-actor-at-24-sparks-discussion-about-social-media-and-internet-culture,Death of South Korean actor at 24 sparks discussion about social media and internet culture,Associated Press,2025-02-18 20:29:17,"SEOUL, FEBRUARY 18 South Korean actor Kim Sae-ron's death this week has triggered an outpouring of grief and calls for changes to the way the country's celebrities are treated in the public arena and on social media, which critics say can foster a culture of harassment. The 24-year-old, who began her career as a child actor and earned acclaim for her roles in several domestic films, including the 2010 crime noir ""The Man from Nowhere,"" was found dead by a friend at her home in the country's capital, Seoul, on Sunday. The National Police Agency has said that officers are not suspecting foul play and that Kim left no note. Once among the brightest stars on South Korea's vibrant movie and television scene, Kim struggled to find work after a 2022 drunk driving incident, for which she was later fined in court. Online posts in South Korea are notoriously harsh toward celebrities who make missteps, especially women, and Kim faced constant negative coverage from news organizations that capitalized on public sentiment. Newspapers and websites criticized her whenever she was seen partying with friends, or when she complained about her lack of work and nasty comments on social media. She was even criticized for smiling while filming an independent movie last year. Following Kim's death, several of the country's major newspapers on Tuesday published editorials and opinion pieces lambasting the toxic online comments about the actor. Some invoked the 2019 deaths of K-Pop singers Seol-li and Goo Hara and the 2023 death of ""Parasite"" actor Lee Sun-kyun while calling for a change in the ""harsh, zero-tolerance"" culture toward celebrities. The Hankook Ilbo newspaper said the country's media outlets were part of the problem, lamenting that some outlets continued to exploit Kim for clicks even after her death, using provocative headlines that highlighted her past struggles. The watchdog Citizens' Coalition for Democratic Media on Tuesday criticized news organizations for blaming social media without considering their own ""sensational and provocative reporting."" Born in 2000, Kim began her acting career at age 9, with the 2009 film ""A Brand New Life,"" portraying a girl's struggles to adjust to a new life after being left at an orphanage by her father. She rose to stardom with ""The Man from Nowhere,"" which was one of the biggest hits in the South Korean movie scene that year and won her a domestic acting award. She starred in various movies and TV shows before the 2022 drunk driving incident. Gold Medalist, Kim's former management agency, did not immediately answer calls for comment.","actor, her, kim, south, death, media, the, sae, ron, seol, hankook, kyun, ilbo, movie, korean, korea, newspapers, driving, seoul, life"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/minister-gurung-defends-social-media-bill-amid-severe-backlash,Minister Gurung defends Social Media Bill amid severe backlash,Bal Krishna Sah,2025-02-03 16:18:12,"KATHMANDU, FEBRUARY 2 Amid severe backlashes of the Social Media Bill (SMB) presented by the government in the Upper House of Federal Parliament, Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, has defended it by expressing that it has been introduced with the aim of strengthening national unity. Minister Gurung stated at the eighth district convention of Press Chautari Nepal, Lamjung district chapter, that the bill was introduced to embrace the fundamental principles of democracy and the values of press freedom, as well as to make them more practical. According to him, the bill has been introduced in parliament, and the necessary discussions will take place to strengthen national sovereignty, independence, and unity. ""The government is aware of the issue of access to information, which is a fundamental right. A bill has been presented in such a way that it does not restrict people's freedom of expression or press freedom,"" he stated. However, the thorough review of the bill by the Himalayan Times has found that the bill proposes a controversial provision of a fine of up to Rs 2.5 million for those who operate social media in Nepal without permission or in violation of the restrictions. Additionally, section 18 of the bill states that if any individual or institution engages in actions detrimental to national interests or incites communal hatred or spoils relations between federal units, then that individual or institution will face a jail term not exceeding five years and a fine not exceeding Rs 500000 or both. More concerning is the provision in the bill to punish obscene and misleading content without clearly defining what they mean in the context of social media platforms. On the other hand, it has received widespread criticism from freedom of expression experts and leading organisations dedicated to the protection of free speech. According to them, bills like SMB should not be considered in any healthy democracy, as they lack adequate consultation and consideration, despite the growing popularity of social media platforms among the general public. Experts believe that if the bill gets endorsed without consultation and in its current form, it is likely to criminalise activities of social media users on it. Furthermore, the bill is likely to provide more security to Singha Durbar, the executive secretariat, than to individual society members, as any social media who post and share, like, repost, livestream, subscribe, comment, tag, hashtag or mention with malicious intent will be liable to punishment if ratified by the parliament. Laxman Datt Pant, a global media rights advocate and the Executive Director of Media Action Nepal, said, ""Parliament should not pass this bill and instead uphold the freedom of speech enshrined as a fundamental right in the Constitution of Nepal and in the international treaties ratified by Nepal."" ""The bill's strict provisions on identity disclosure and restrictions on anonymous social media use infringe on privacy rights and discourage whistleblowers from exposing wrongdoings,"" Pant added. Similarly, During a recent event organised by the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ) to hand over certificates to newly elected National and Provincial Council members of the FNJ, it was emphasised that the bill is unacceptable to those who value press freedom. Ram Prasad Dahal, Central General Secretary of the Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ), stated that the bill is against freedom of expression. According to him, the proposed bill risks narrowing press and freedom of expression amid social media becoming an important medium for information and expression exchange in a democratic society; attempts to impose strict controls on it signal an encroachment on these freedoms. Calling for the withdrawal of the bill, Dahal stated, ""The bill should be amended and revised only after discussions with journalists, human rights activists, civil society, and stakeholders. The FNJ, as a leading civil society organisation, would not remain silent if the bill is pushed forward without such consultations.""","bill, media, the, journalists, social, fnj, freedom, parliament, society, chautari, lamjung, expression, national, provision, federation, federal, press, information, upper, rights"

Addressing the Tamu Journalism Award Distribution and Launching of the Gurung News.com Year Book Programme organized by Tamu (Gurung) Mediapersons' Association Nepal here today, Minister Gurung, who is also the government spokesman, expressed the government's determination to bring to justice anyone implicated in the cooperative fund misappropriation as per the report prepared by the Parliamentary Investigation Committee under lawmaker Surya Thapa's leadership. He said that no one was above the law and made it clear anybody whether they are the leaders or cadres of the Nepali Congress, the UML, Maoist or any other party would be brought to justice. Stating that all those named by lawmaker Thapa's report cannot be brought to justice simultaneously together now, Minister Gurung said, ""We will not let off any one and take action against them turn by turn. Let those involved in cooperative fraud never think that they can escape the law. All will be arrested as per the law."" He termed as unconstitutional the protest demonstration aimed at freeing Rabi Lamichhane, the President of Rastriya Swotantra Party (RSP), who is in police custody in connection with investigation process on the charge of cooperative fraud. The government spokesman also expressed his objection over such acts which according to him are carried out with the objective of influencing the case which is being considered by the court, calling attention of the sides concerned not to carry out activities that are against the democratic conduct and process. ""It is the RSP's responsibility to cooperate in the investigation process against its leader. It is not at all appropriate to seek to influence the investigation process by organizing sit-in and protest demos, until the Respected Court gives its verdict. I urge RSP to stand on the side of the rule of law and the due process, rather than the undemocratic acts,"" Minister Gurung reiterated.","gurung, the, tamu, investigation, fraud, cooperative, thapa, surya, acts, spokesman, process, distribution, com, lawmaker, court, award, launching, swotantra, party, journalism"

He addressed the media on Sunday to clarify the matter. Minister Gurung, who also serves as the government spokesperson, asserted that the coalition government, formed by the two major parties, Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML, will remain stable until the next general election in 2084. ""The NC and UML together hold 167 seats in parliament. No additional parties were required to secure a majority,"" he said, emphasizing that as long as these two major parties share the common vision of the alliance as essential for addressing national crises, no external factors could destabilize it. He further claimed that the current government has rescued the nation from potential failure and has eradicated social intolerance. ""The NC-UML consensus resembles the unity seen in 2048, 2056, and 2064. We aim to maintain this alliance and engage in healthy competition in the next election,"" Gurung reiterated. He explained that delays in completing national pride projects were due to policy confusion, low revenue collection, and weak budget enforcement, all stemming from previous political instability. The current government, formed amidst such challenges and rising trade deficits, is now working diligently to demonstrate its capabilities. Political stability and good governance remain top priorities for the government, alongside concluding the remaining tasks of the peace process. Acknowledging that it is rare for the two largest parties in a parliamentary system to form a government together, Gurung stated that this coalition was established with a shared commitment to development, prosperity, and stability. He also noted that in times of national political challenges, major parties have historically united. ""This government was formed under such circumstances and is determined to achieve its objectives at any cost,"" Gurung emphasized.","government, parties, gurung, the, alliance, stability, coalition, deficits, election, minister, intolerance, meaning, uml, rumors, enforcement, challenges, capabilities, 167, technology, confusion"

A total of 75 participants, including 22 Nepali Army personnel, four Armed Police Force (APF) officers, and volunteers from Rotary Club Balaju, came together in a clean-up campaign organised by CREASION Nepal, resulting in the collection of a staggering 1,120 kilograms of waste. Supported by Project CAP (Collaborative Approach for Preventing Plastic Leakages in Rivers of Nepal), this campaign aimed to address plastic pollution and promote sustainable practices. ""River clean-ups are a way of changing our behaviour in order to reduce the amount of plastic waste we throw into the river,"" said Sujata Koirala, Project CAP focal person and general secretary of CREASION. ""Plastic waste has stood as a problem in flood-affected regions, particularly after devastating flooding following incessant downpour in October. Nature is clearly giving it back, reflecting on how it should be properly managed. Thus, we have completed 13 clean-ups in total through Project CAP across Nepal."" The project, funded by the PLEASE (Plastic Free Rivers and Seas for South Asia) Project, is implemented by the South Asia Co-operative Environment Programme, supported by the World Bank, and with implementing assistance from UNOPS. The VFC Youth Cohort, trained under Project CAP, took the lead in organising the event, demonstrating the power of youth in driving environmental action. The presence of Jamadar Ishwari P. Bhattarai from the Nepali Army underscored the collaborative spirit of the initiative, bringing together diverse groups to combat plastic waste effectively. ""This cleanup wasn't just about removing waste from the riverbanks; it was about fostering community action and inspiring others to carry forward the mission of sustainability,"" shared a representative from the youth cohort. While this marks the final river clean-up under the project, Project CAP's broader initiatives continue, focusing on empowering communities, fostering environmental stewardship, and preventing plastic pollution at its source. By tackling waste at critical points, the project ensures that Nepal's rivers remain cleaner, healthier, and more vibrant. Participants reflected on their shared efforts; the event became a testament to the enduring impact of collective action and community-led initiatives. The Bagmati River Clean-Up Campaign serves as a strong reminder of the power of collaboration in building a sustainable future.","plastic, river, project, cap, clean, cohort, the, collaborative, 120, leakages, campaign, rivers, bagmati, kilograms, ups, youth, army, up, waste, participants"

Kabindra Burlakoti, Acting General Secretary of RSP, stated that the Deputy Speaker had already explained about the letter. He said this today at a press conference to update the public on the national gathering's preparations. He insisted that the issue is being brought up again because the ruling coalition does not have a majority in the Constitutional Council. Two-thirds of the 275 MPs of the House of Representatives, i.e., 183 MPs, are required to remove Deputy Speaker Rana Magar. The ruling party has 180 MPs- Congress (88), CPN-UML (77), Ashok Rai-led Janata Samajwadi Party (7), Loktantrik Samajwadi Party (4), and Nagarik Unmukti Party (4). Three more members are required to remove the deputy speaker. However, if six Janamat Party lawmakers vote to remove the Deputy Speaker, it will easily reach the two-thirds majority. Burlakoti, on the other hand, stated, ""If we look at it from the perspective of an error, the letter sent from her position was not used for any purpose. It is not a mistake that could result in her losing her position. Hence, the RSP advocates for her."" The deputy speaker's secretariat made some mistakes with the letter, but she clarified that she did nothing wrong. Meanwhile, Janamat Party president CK Raut said in a program on Wednesday that the removal of Deputy Speaker Rana Magar is being orchestrated with ill-intentions. He suspected the Prime Minister of attempting to remove the Deputy Speaker in order to gain a majority on the Constitutional Council. ""This action would diminish democracy. As it appears that the large parties are bent on destroying small parties,"" he said. Article 284 of the Constitution establishes the Constitutional Council. The Prime Minister chairs the committee in charge of recommending the appointment of the Chief Justice and the heads and officials of constitutional bodies, which includes the Chief Justice, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Speaker of the National Assembly, the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, and the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. Based on current political representation, the ruling party appears to be in the minority in the Constitutional Council. Apart from Prime Minister Oli, Speaker Devraj Ghimire was elected as a UML candidate. Narayan Dahal, the National Assembly Speaker, is a member of the CPN-MC, while Indira Rana Magar represents the RSP. However, the constitution requires that parliamentary leadership positions be neutral, with no party affiliation. Deputy Speaker Rana wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu on February 26 of last year, requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she has been under pressure to resign.","speaker, party, the, deputy, mps, rana, janamat, samajwadi, thirds, indira, magar, constitutional, raut, constitution, cpn, ruling, janata, majority, ashok, rsp"

Talking to media persons at Biratnagar Airport today, Chairperson Dahal expressed the view that it would not be appropriate to relieve form post the woman leader who is from an indigenous community and worked selflessly for children's upliftment and rights. He stressed, ""It is wrong to remove Rana, who has significant contribution in the sector of indigenous nationalities and child rights. I believe the ruling parties will roll back their move on it."" On a different note, also the former Prime Minister, Dahal laid emphasis on appointment of Chief Justice based on seniority, sharing names of eight judges who were recommended for CJ in the Friday's meeting of Constitutional Council. They are now engaged to strengthen party in all provinces as the Maoist Centre had made huge sacrifice for the change in country, he reminded.

With all of the meetings and mounting pressure on the deputy speaker, it is clear that NC is prepared to impeach her if she does not exit easily. ""During a meeting of the party's office bearers and former officials on Wednesday at the residence of NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba in Budhanilkantha. We agreed that the Deputy Speaker tender resignation on her own or we would move constitutionally,"" said Meen Bahadur Biswokarma, NC's Department Head of Information, Communications and Publicity. He stated that the meeting concluded that it is inappropriate for the Deputy Speaker to contact an embassy and request visa interview dates for individuals unrelated to her official role. He stated that the NC expects Deputy Speaker Rana to resign voluntarily, as her actions have been deemed inappropriate, particularly when involving a foreign mission. ""If she does not resign, as the ruling and largest party in Parliament, we will be forced to take robust action,"" he said. The ruling coalition is planning to introduce a motion in Parliament to remove the Deputy Speaker from her position. According to Article 91 (6)(c) of the constitution, the position of Speaker or Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives shall become vacant if a resolution is adopted by a majority of two-thirds of the total number of then-members of the House of Representatives stating that his or her conduct is incompatible with his or her office. Nepali Congress leader Meen Bahadur Bishwokarma told THT that NC and UML top leaders viewed that Rana Magar's conduct was not compatible with her office and they were serious about the issue. Deputy Speaker Rana became embroiled in controversy after it was revealed that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for six individuals unrelated to her official role. Deputy Speaker Rana wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu on February 26 of last year, requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she has been under pressure to resign. Santosh Pariyar, the chief whip of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, has defended Magar. He argued that when rulers become corrupt, the state fails. ""After seeing the multitude of news reports today (about the ruling parties' decision to urge the Deputy Speaker to resign), I have the impression that the state is attacking democracy,"" he said. He stated that the ruling parties that fought for democracy were attempting to impeach the Deputy Speaker, and that if they succeeded, the RSP would lose one constitutional post while continuing to fight for democracy and the people. He said the ruling parties' decision to impeach the Deputy Speaker could not be accepted in a democracy. Meanwhile, CPN-MC lawmakers stated that Rana Magar, who came from an ethnic background and was well-known for her social work, was elected Deputy Speaker through party consensus, and it was concerning that the ruling parties were now discussing impeaching her. However, Nepali Congress Chief Whip Shyam Ghimire issued the whip to NC lawmakers, instructing them not to leave the valley until September 19 and to return before then if they are outside. It implies that the NC is already planning to remove Deputy Speaker Rana Magar through any means necessary. They would need a two-thirds majority to impeach her if she did not pave the way on her own, which they are ready to propose with the help of ruling coalition members. UML Lawmaker Hemraj Rai has also stated that Deputy Speaker Rana Magar should now clarify the allegations made against her. He added that the House should not be compelled to begin the impeachment process against her.","speaker, deputy, the, whip, rana, meen, ruling, her, nc, magar, bahadur, hemraj, party, bishwokarma, conduct, shyam, visa, embassy, thirds, congress"

As the Executive Director of the Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) and a Principal Scientist with a PhD in Clinical Veterinary Science from Yamaguchi University, Japan, Dr. Khanal is no stranger to tackling significant challenges. With Nepal's agricultural sector at a critical crossroads, he has spearheaded initiatives to integrate modern research with traditional practices, ensuring that innovation reaches every farmer. In this exclusive interview with Bal Krishna Sah of The Himalayan Times, Dr Khanal delves into the agricultural agreement between Nepal and India, shedding light on how collaboration can shape the future of farming in the region. Get ready for an insightful journey into the possibilities and hurdles of agriculture in Nepal-a sector that promises to feed a nation and fuel its economy. Excerpts: THT: Can you describe the primary objectives of the India-Nepal New Partnership in Agriculture? The partnership is an ambitious initiative to transformNepal's agricultural sector. During the Prime Minister's 2018 visit to India, an agreement was reached for India to assist Nepal in establishing a modern agricultural system under NARC's leadership. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) prepared a detailed project report (DPR) to set up a Centre for Agricultural Research and Education in Nepal. This project envisions integrating research, education, and extension services-a model that has proven successful in India-to enhance agricultural outcomes and build capacity among scientists. By enabling NARC researchers to earn advanced degrees, the initiative motivates staff and strengthens the link between research and practical benefits for farmers. However, progress depends on high-level political commitment and parliamentary approval to amend the current laws governing NARC. THT: How has this partnership influenced Nepal'sagricultural research and development initiatives? The partnership has already delivered tangible benefits, such as introducing resilient seed varieties that can withstand floods and droughts. These advancements are particularly significant for Nepal, where diverse climates-ranging from tropical to temperate-offer unique opportunities for agricultural innovation. Digital soil mapping has begun, allowing better crop recommendations based on soil types. Furthermore, plans to establish agro-processing industries, such as cold storage and food processing units, are underway to reduce wastage and increase farmers' incomes. While these initiatives highlight the partnership's potential, sustained efforts and resources are essential to realise its full impact. THT: What specific projects have been implemented under this partnership that have significantly impacted you? Several impactful projects have emerged under this partnership. India has provided flood- and drought-resistant seed varieties, contributing to climate-resilient farming in Nepal. Agro-processing initiatives, such as cold storage facilities for surplus produce and industries for processing apples and oranges, are also in the pipeline. These facilities aim to reduce post-harvest losses and boost farmers' earnings. Additionally, collaborative efforts have addressed transboundary animal diseases like foot-and-mouth disease, which is a critical step for Nepal to meet international export standards. With its unique biodiversity and climate diversity, Nepal has the potential to develop premium-quality agricultural products for global markets. THT: In what ways do you think collaborative agricultural research can enhance food security for Nepal's growing population? Collaboration with India can significantly enhance Nepal's food security by adopting proven models from countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam. Both nations have achieved remarkable progress in developing high-yielding crop varieties, such as rice and maize, which could be replicated in Nepal. India's expertise in using nuclear technology for agriculture-to produce disease-resistant, high-yield crops-offers another opportunity. For instance, this technology can eliminate foodborne diseases and enhance export potential. By fostering such collaborations, Nepal can address its food security challenges while positioning itself as a leader in agricultural innovation. THT: How important is it for Nepal to integrate innovative agricultural practices from India into its farming systems? Integrating India's advanced technologies into Nepal's farming systems is essential for modernisation and growth. India's nuclear-based agricultural advancements and organic farming methods can be particularly beneficial. Nepal's pristine mountain regions, largely untouched by chemical fertilisers and pesticides, can produce premium organic products for export. However, the challenge lies in effectively disseminating these innovations to farmers, especially under the complexities of Nepal's three-tier governance structure. Addressing these barriers is crucial to ensuring farmers benefit from the latest agricultural technologies. THT: Can you share examples of knowledge exchange between Indian and Nepali agricultural scientists that have led to successful outcomes? There has been a productive knowledge exchange between ICAR and NARC, leading to advancements in seed technology and pest management. However, such exchanges have diminished in recent years due to administrative gaps. Renewing the two institutions'memorandum of understanding (MOU) could reinvigorate collaboration. Regular exchanges of scientists, policymakers, and even farmers could foster mutual learning, enabling both countries to tackle shared challenges in agriculture. THT: What role does education play in this partnership, particularly regarding training programs for farmers and agricultural professionals? Education is a cornerstone of this partnership. NARC is working to establish master's and PhD programs for scientists and technical staff, which will build expertise and drive innovation in the sector. Additionally, NARC plans to set up farmer training centres in all seven provinces, providing localised knowledge and practical solutions. These initiatives empower agricultural professionals and farmers, creating a more resilient and productive farming system. THT: How do you see climate resilience being addressed through collaborative agricultural projects? Climate resilience is a pressing issue for Nepal, which is ranked among the most vulnerable countries globally. Collaborative projects have introduced climate-smart farming techniques, such as direct-seeded rice, which reduces soil erosion and water usage. Integrating livestock farming with cropping systems is another approach to maintaining soil fertility and sustainability. While mechanisation has benefits, traditional practices like oxen ploughing and organic manure remain vital for long-term soil health. Balancing these approaches is key to addressing climate change while ensuring agricultural productivity. THT: How does the partnership aim to support smallholder farmers in Nepal, particularly regarding access to resources and technology? The partnership significantly emphasises supporting smallholder farmers through cooperative farming and land pooling initiatives. Large corporations can play a crucial role by offering buyback guarantees and providing input materials to farmers, ensuring both support and market access. These measures aim to motivate small farmers to adopt advanced practices and increase production, ultimately improving their livelihoods. THT: What challenges have you encountered in implementing joint agricultural initiatives, and how have they been overcome? One major challenge has been bureaucratic delays caused by the lack of direct communication channels between NARC and Indian counterparts. Diplomacy often involves lengthy processes through multiple ministries, hindering timely action. Improved coordination and flexible policies are needed to bridge these gaps. Additionally, fostering closer ties with Nepal's Ministry of Agriculture has been essential to align goals and streamline implementation. THT: Could you discuss any initiatives to promote sustainable farming practices among Nepali farmers? Sustainable farming practices, such as climate-smart agriculture, are gaining momentum. Techniques like direct-seeded rice and drip irrigation have shown promise in reducing water usage and improving soil health. However, the high cost of equipment remains a barrier for individual farmers. Cooperative efforts and government support are necessary to make these technologies more accessible. Additionally, relay cropping and livestock integration with farming can enhance soil fertility and ensure long-term sustainability. THT: What feedback have you received from local communities regarding the benefits of these collaborative projects? Farmers generally appreciate the innovations introduced through these collaborations but highlight challenges like the high cost of equipment and seasonal availability. Technologies like drip irrigation and plastic greenhouses have enabled off-season farming, increasing incomes. However, broader access to these resources is needed to maximise their impact on rural communities. THT: How do you envision the future of agriculture in Nepal evolving due to this partnership? The partnership has immense potential to transform Nepal's agricultural landscape. By leveraging its diverse climates and fostering collaboration with India, Nepal can position itself as a regional leader in agricultural innovation. Early warning systems, toll-free advisory services, and robust seed programs already demonstrate the benefits of collaboration. Strengthening these efforts could further enhance productivity and resilience. THT: In your opinion, what factors contribute to successful collaboration between India and Nepal in the agricultural sector? Successful collaboration requires mutual trust, respect, and a focus on actionable outcomes. Political leaders and researchers must prioritise delivering tangible results over rhetoric. A culture of accountability and commitment to progress is essential to realising the full potential of this partnership. THT: How can this partnership serve as a model for future collaborations between countries with similar agricultural challenges? The India-Nepal partnership can become a blueprint for addressing shared agricultural challenges worldwide. Demonstrating effective collaboration and delivering measurable results can inspire similar initiatives in neighbouring countries and regions. This model could play a pivotal role in enhancing global food and nutrition security, which remains a critical goal for the future.","agricultural, farming, these, farmers, research, initiatives, partnership, soil, the, climate, nepal, practices, food, challenges, technologies, seed, collaborative, varieties, projects, khanal"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/intentional-transformation-a-gateway-for-lively-governance-in-nepal,Intentional transformation: A gateway for lively governance in Nepal,Raghav Pratap Thakur,2025-01-10 11:16:41,"We all were taught that actions speak louder than words; however, have we ever examined the intentions behind our actions? Intentions are actually the inner-most layer of our 'consciousness dynamics' that guides our five senses and the cognition to activate and then choose or neglect a certain course of action. We are living in a world with the highest possibility and the highest urgency. To put it simple, the advancement of technology, diplomatic and digital connectivity, globalisation of corporates as well as humanitarian actions and spiritual activism have all paved the pathways of possibilities on one hand; on the other hand, climate crisis, pork barrel politics, rampant corruption and burgeoning humanitarian catastrophes are demanding the most urgent responses. The binary of possibility and urgency are polarising every next day, the flip side of which could be harnessing the accelerated change the whole human family expects and needs at present. The global operating environment is largely changing due to the shifts in geo-economic hegemonial orders, diffusion of power and extreme digital dependence, including Artificial Intelligence, giving rise to a possibility-urgency seesaw. So, the poised question here is, what can be the factor that can synchronously assemble these two together and optimise the opportunities of socio-economic growth, larger human welfare and technology-for-prosperity framework? The first brick in the wall here would be 'intentional transformation'. Intentional transformation is a deep, self-reflective and wisdom-over-mind journey, which moves around the orbit of internalising, localising and globalising the human value system. It is also about penetrating the ""status quo bias"" that has largely made us think and visualise self-centric success and restrict ourselves to be part of a wider and larger welfare system. The trajectory of any prosperous nation fundamentally started with the right intentions of the political leadership, governance instruments and levers, and its citizens. Be it Lee Kuan Yew who planted the initial development spores in Singapore or Paul Kagame's visionary growth roadmap for Rwanda, their actions were guided by genuine intentions to grow, flourish and serve. Japan's work-ethics, innovation, world-class education and global charity were all possible with the seeds of positive intentions of its leaders and undeniably by its people. Now, let's be Nepal-centric. As per the World Economic Outlook 2024, Nepal ranks 41st in the list of the world's poorest countries out of 190. As soon as we process this information in our head, how do we think and feel as a citizen? The course and perspective of governance has largely changed over a period of time. It is no more a relationship between the ruler and the ruled but is more like a 'collaborative management' of various kinds of resources for better socio-economic lives. By large, Nepal has made remarkable progress in its structural dimensions – it has a good constitution, better laws and policies, GESI-centric plans and programmes, three tiers of government and public service offices at people's proximity to name a few. These structures are like the skeleton of the body, which makes the latter visible, but what adds life to it is the soul. These structural frameworks, therefore, without complemented by the functional dimension are merely bodies without life. We are standing on the crossroads of giving a better life to these wonderful structures engineered through the contributions and sacrifices of many. And here again the gamechanger is 'genuine intentions' to work for the same. 'Intentional transformation' is the master key which has three interconnected actions at its core to complete the process and act as a breakthrough to restore our values-based capacities as individual, organisation and society. Cognitive: Intentions are more like the operating system in the computers upon which the whole oscillations of input, process and output are relied. We humans are born with some genetic or biological intentions, which in course of time are influenced by our socialisation and self-preferences of life goals. The transformation of these intentions is possible at a cognitive level by self-realisation, self-renewal and self-mastery. From a governance outlook, both leaders and citizens need to review their own intentions and their by-product of actions. The mantra of 'you can never lie to yourself' is a mirror to evaluate your own intentions. Connective: Keeping yourself connected and linked to positive intentions around your family, society, workplace, spiritual gurus or global performers is one important approach to transform your own value system. This particular dimension is highly relevant in Nepalese political governance. The leaders in the country are highly influenced by their advisors and the 'kitchen cabinet', which implies that there is almost a ""cause and effect"" relationship of their intentions over the political decisions. Therefore, the recognition as well as the litmus test of the intentions has to be performed by the political leaders before forming their advisory team. Strategic: The transformation is not at all something- once and over activity- but an incessant and rigorous progression. Being strategic would facilitate oneself to make various kinds of roadmaps, guidelines and inspirations to follow through by purifying and humanising the intentions. In a way it also bridges the above two actions of intentional transformation. After all the above, the takeaway elixir is that the leaders as well as the citizens at every level need to initiate the journey of intentional transformation that will gradually shift our thought process and emotional cognition from recognition to contribution. Most importantly, we can then transcend from the viewpoint of ""blame game"" to ""I will do my part"".

Erling Haaland. While Cristiano Ronaldo, Harry Kane, Kylian Mbappe and Romelu Lukaku have the chance to extend their goal-scoring records and legacies at Euro 2024, Haaland will likely be on vacation after Norway's failure to qualify for the tournament held in June and July. That might be welcome news for Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, allowing his star striker the chance to rest after a long season. But it robs Haaland of the chance to compete for one of the biggest international prizes, having also missed out on last year's World Cup. It could also impact his ambitions of winning the Ballon d'Or award next year and being confirmed the world's No. 1 soccer player. International trophies are a key factor in determining who wins the sport's biggest individual prize. Take away Lionel Messi's World Cup triumph with Argentina last year and the Ballon d'Or would likely have been won by the goal-scoring powerhouse behind City's trophy treble of the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup. Instead, Haaland had to settle for the position of runner-up after a season in which he scored 52 goals. Messi picked up the golden ball for a record-extending eighth time. Perhaps he will be in contention for a ninth if he can lead Argentina to victory in next year's Copa America and win more silverware with Inter Miami in MLS. Ronaldo, too, is showing little sign of lowering his ambitions on the international stage, despite moving to Saudi Arabia with Al Nassr. He is already the leading scorer in international soccer with 128 goals. If selected by Portugal, he will appear in his sixth Euros, having played in a record 25 matches in the finals and scored the most goals in tournament history with 14. He will be 39 by then and part of a Portugal team that will be among the favorites after a perfect winning record of 10 out of 10 in qualifying. Even if he is playing his club soccer in Saudi Arabia, it would be difficult to look past Ronaldo for the Ballon d'Or if he won the Euros for a second time so late in his storied career. Kane may have ended his long wait for silverware by time the Euros come around after his move to Bayern Munich in the offseason. England's all-time record scorer has made a spectacular start to life in Germany with 21 goals in 15 appearances for his new club. Bayern is likely to be one of the main rivals to City for this year's Champions League on the back of Kane's goal-scoring form. And in an England team that was runner-up at the last Euros and has been boosted by an ever-maturing Jude Bellingham, Kane will have his sights on ending his country's wait for a first trophy since the World Cup in 1966. Mbappe, who scored a hat trick in France's 14-0 win against Gibraltar last week, is closing in on Olivier Giroud's all-time record of 56 goals for the national team. The Paris Saint-Germain striker is on 46 goals. He and Haaland have been tipped to succeed Messi and Ronaldo as soccer's next global icons and France's greater potential than Norway to win international honors could give Mbappe an advantage. Even Lukaku, whose club career has been on the downturn over the past two years, has more hope than Haaland of winning big for his country. His scoring feats for Belgium just keep on improving, with 83 goals in 113 appearances, while he was also the leading scorer in Euros qualifying with 14. Robert Lewandowski could also still make the tournament if Poland advances via the playoffs. It is a problem that could haunt Haaland throughout his career if Norway continues to miss out on the big tournaments. His goal-scoring prowess is likely to see him break numerous records and win a slew of trophies with City. Ballon d'Ors should follow. But with Mbappe, in particular, expected to be his biggest rival in the years to come, he may regularly have to watch on with envy as the France striker gets to showcase his talents on international soccer's grandest stages.","ballon, his, the, goals, soccer, scoring, euros, record, year, olivier, giroud, cup, manchester, kane, france, or, copa, lukaku, goal, striker"

If they both advance to the playoff final, they could meet in a neutral country. In the other playoff brackets, Wales will host Finland and the winner will then host Poland or Estonia, and Georgia or Luxembourg host either Euro 2004 champion Greece or Kazakhstan. European soccer governing body UEFA allocated home advantage for the finals in the three brackets. The 12 teams entered the playoffs based on their results and standings in Nations League groups played last year. Their standing in Euro 2024 qualifying groups this year did not affect the seeding for Thursday's draw. The winners of the three finals will play at the 24-team Euro 2024 tournament, joining the 20 teams that qualified directly and host Germany. Israel, which became a UEFA member in 1994, has never qualified for the European Championship. Ukraine is back in the playoffs for a major soccer tournament after losing at Wales 1-0 last year in a match for a spot at the World Cup in Qatar. That match had to be delayed after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine is ""the strongest"" of the 12 teams in the playoff semifinals, Bosnia coach Savo Milošević said. ""It's special to play against Ukraine in these days but it's also special because I think among these 12 teams maybe they are the best,"" Milošević told The Associated Press at UEFA headquarters. Ukraine dropped into the playoffs after a 0-0 draw with Euro 2020 champion Italy on Monday when a win would have qualified the team alongside group winner England. Wales coach Robert Page said it was better to avoid Ukraine this time after the emotion of their game in Cardiff in June 2022.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/china-and-russia-plan-to-work-together-for-a-two-state-solution-for-israel-and-the-palestinians,China and Russia plan to work together for a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians,Associated Press,2023-10-20 22:56:52,"BEIJING, OCTOBER 20 China and Russia share the same position on the Palestinian issue and plan to try to work together to cool the situation and help establish a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, a top Chinese envoy said Friday. Zhai Jun, China's special envoy to the Middle East, spoke after a meeting Thursday in Qatar with Mikhail Bogdanov, the Russian president's special representative for the Middle East and Africa. ""The fundamental reason for the current situation of the Palestine-Israel conflict is that the Palestinian people's lawful national rights have not been guaranteed,"" Zhai said, according to a statement released on Friday by the Chinese foreign ministry. ""China and Russia have the same position on the Palestine question, and China is ready to maintain communication and coordination with Russia to promote de-escalation of the situation,"" Zhai said. The two countries want to ""play a positive role in resuming talks for peace between Palestine and Israel, truly implementing the two-state solution, and promoting a comprehensive, just and enduring solution to the Palestinian question at an early date,"" Zhai said. China sent Zhai to the Middle East to push for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in the latest sign of its ambition to play a larger role in the region. The two sides confirmed their ""unwavering focus on closely coordinating efforts for the political settlement of this and other crises in the Middle East and North Africa region,"" Russia's Foreign Ministry said, according to the country's Tass state news agency. China, which sees the U.S. as too pro-Israel, has said it opposes attacks on civilians, but hasn't condemned the initial Hamas attack that started the latest war. Instead, it has called for an immediate cease-fire to protect civilians as Israel bombards Gaza before a possible ground invasion. ""We believe that when dealing with hot spot issues in the international community, major powers should be objective and impartial,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Friday. In his meeting with Bogdanov, Zhai said Beijing was saddened by ""a great number of civilian casualties caused by the Palestine-Israel conflict and the sharp deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Palestine."" Beijing describes Hamas as a ""resistance movement,"" not as a terrorist group as Israel and other countries do. Analysts say that China wants to position itself as a mediator and exert its influence in the region as the U.S. shifts its global attention elsewhere. But the latest Gaza war has drawn the U.S. back in, with President Joe Biden visiting Israel this week. Zhai also met with Qatar's minister of state for foreign affairs, Mohammed Abdulaziz al-Khulaifi, the Chinese foreign ministry said. Mao, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said that Zhai would travel to other Middle Eastern countries, but she didn't give any further details. Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly told Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week that ""Egypt and other Arab countries highly appreciate China's consistent and just position on the Palestinian question and expect China to play a bigger role in solving the current crisis,"" according to a Chinese statement on their meeting. Xi told Madbouly, who was in Beijing to attend a forum on China's Belt and Road infrastructure-building initiative, that the top priority is to stop the fighting and prevent it from causing a severe humanitarian crisis. He said China ""stands ready to strengthen coordination with Egypt and other Arab countries to work for a comprehensive, just and enduring solution to the Palestinian question,"" the Chinese statement said.","chinese, the, foreign, ministry, ning, madbouly, mostafa, solution, mao, palestinian, palestine, envoy, countries, situation, cease, middle, statement, jinping, question, role"

Benjamin Netanyahu accepted, and China was on track for a bigger role in the region. Then came the Hamas attack against Israel, which has made Netanyahu's late October trip uncertain and put Beijing's Middle East approach to the test. China's stated neutrality on the war has upset Israel, but Beijing may gain in the long run by forging closer ties with Arab countries, experts said. ""For a while at least, Beijing's Middle East policy is paralyzed by the war,"" said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Beijing-based Renmin University of China. ""The US, which strongly supports Israel, is directly or indirectly involved. Who is there to listen to China?"" That hasn't stopped China from trying to be heard. Its Middle East envoy, Zhai Jun, talked to Palestinian and Egyptian officials by phone this past week, calling for an immediate cease-fire and humanitarian support for the Palestinian people. Zhai also called Israeli officials to say China ""has no selfish interests on the Palestinian issue but has always stood on the side of peace, on the side of fairness and justice."" He said that ""China is willing to work with the international community to promote peace and encourage talks."" Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, came out more strongly for the Palestinians, saying ""the crux of the matter is that justice has not been done to the Palestinian people."" ""This conflict once again proved in an extremely tragic manner that the way to solve the Palestinian issue lies in resuming genuine peace talks as soon as possible and realizing the legitimate rights of the Palestinian nation,"" Wang said during a call with an adviser to the Brazilian president. China has long advocated for a two-state solution that allows for an independent Palestinian state. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, while traveling in the Mideast over the weekend, called Wang to ask China to use whatever influence it has in the region to keep other countries and groups from entering the conflict and broadening it, according to the State Department, which declined to characterize Wang's response. China is known to have close trade and political ties with Iran, which in turn supports Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah. The conversation was the first high-level US contact with China over the Mideast situation since the Hamas attack. Beijing, by trying to maintain a delicate balance, wants to position itself as a mediator and exert its influence in the region, said Maria Papageorgiou, a lecturer in politics and international relations at University of Exeter, and Mohammad Eslami, a researcher at University Minho, in joint email. The US support for Israel will give China an opportunity to expand its arms sales to dissatisfied Arab countries, but China also wants to resolve the crisis to protect its economic interests in the region, they said. ""China's engagement in the Middle East is set to increase during this conflict. Beijing will play an enhanced role in efforts to end the war and secure its economic interests and wants to capitalize on the Arab states' frustration with US to establish itself as a great power in the region,"" the researchers wrote. Beijing's approach, though, risks alienating Israel. Tuvia Gering, a researcher at the Israel-China Policy Center at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, described Beijing's position as ""pro-Palestine neutrality,"" much like its position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine has signaled support for the Kremlin. ""You cannot be neutral in something like this. Silence is acquiescence,"" Gering said. ""The problem, I think, the biggest one we have, is that China, instead of being the responsible major power that it claims to be, it is exploiting this conflict for geopolitical benefits."" He said China was looking to win the support of Arab countries on contentious issues such as Beijing's treatment of the Muslim ethnic Uyghurs in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. Under Xi, Beijing has pursued a proactive, sometimes assertive, foreign policy. It has sought closer ties in the Middle East, the source of much of the oil China needs and a nexus in the Belt and Road network, Xi's massive infrastructure-building project to connect markets around the world through railways, roads, seaports and airports and to extend Beijing's influence. This year, Beijing helped restore diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, building its credentials as an alternative to the United States in brokering peace deals. Wang Yiwei, another international relations professor at Renmin University, said China is better positioned than the U.S. to help resolve conflicts, whether between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Russia and Ukraine or Israel and the Palestinians. ""If you're just on one side, and make another side hate you, you cannot be a broker,"" he said. ""So that's the reason China did not join the West to sanction or contain Russia in the Ukraine war. Because we need to be the bridge."" But China's proposals to end the war have been seen as benefiting Russia. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, ""China's stance might be more about projecting an image of a neutral and responsible global player rather than acting like one,"" said Dale Aluf, research director at Sino-Israel Global Network and Academic Leadership, an Israel-based think tank. China's continued insistence on a two-state solution is ""disconnected from reality,"" Aluf said. China also has displeased Israel by refusing to join the U.S. and other countries in designating Hamas a terrorist organization, seeing it instead as a ""Palestinian resistance movement."" Since the war began, Chinese state media have come down hard on Israel. They have cited Iranian news outlets in reporting the illegal use of white phosphorous bombs by the Israeli military. And they have blamed the U.S., Israel's strongest supporter, for fanning the tensions in the region. Bombarded with hostile messages, the Israeli mission in Beijing now filters the comments on its Chinese social media account. There has been a surge of antisemitic sentiment in the Chinese internet, said Yaqiu Wang, research director for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan at Freedom House. ""On the Israel-Palestine conflict, the Chinese government has always propagated a narrative that places the blame squarely on Israel, a key U.S. ally, because this aligns with a key objective of (the ruling Communist Party's) propaganda: to undermine the U.S. in the international community. This time, it is no exception,"" she said.","the, palestinian, beijing, china, israel, chinese, israeli, wang, renmin, conflict, east, middle, state, palestine, university, neutrality, an, arab, network, policy"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/the-israel-hamas-war-no-matter-who-loses-iran-wins,"The Israel-Hamas war: No matter who loses, Iran wins",Associated Press,2023-10-09 21:49:24,"TEL AVIV, OCTOBER 9 There will be only one winner in the war that has broken out between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. And it is neither Israel nor Hamas. In an operation coined ""the Al-Aqsa Storm,"" Hamas, whose formal name is the Islamic Resistance Movement, fired thousands of rockets into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters infiltrated Israel by land, sea and air. Hundreds of Israelis have been killed, more than 2,000 injured, and many taken hostage. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war on Hamas and launched airstrikes in Gaza. In the first day of reprisals, close to 400 Palestinians were killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. In the weeks ahead, the Israeli military will surely retaliate and kill hundreds more Palestinian militants and civilians. As an analyst of Middle East politics and security, I believe that thousands on both sides will suffer. But when the smoke settles, only one country's interests will have been served: Iran's. Already, some analysts are suggesting that Tehran's fingerprints can be seen on the surprise attack on Israel. At the very least, Iran's leaders have reacted to the assault with encouragementand support. The decisive factor shaping Iran's foreign policy was the 1979 overthrow of the U.S.-friendly, repressive Shah of Iran and the transfer of state power into the hands of a Shiite Muslim revolutionary regime. That regime was defined by stark anti-American imperialism and anti-Israeli Zionism. The revolution, its leaders claimed, was not just against the corrupt Iranian monarchy; it was intended to confront oppression and injustice everywhere, and especially those governments backed by the United States – chief among them, Israel. For Iran's leaders, Israel and the United States represented immorality, injustice and the greatest threat to Muslim society and Iranian security. The enduring hostility felt toward Israel is in no small part due to its close ties with the shah and Israel's role in his sustained oppression of the Iranian people. Together with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Israel's intelligence service, the Mossad, helped organize the shah's secret police and intelligence service, the SAVAK. This organization relied on increasingly harsh tactics to put down dissenters during the shah's last two decades in power, including mass imprisonment, torture, disappearances, forced exile and killing thousands of Iranians. Support for Palestinian liberation was a central theme of Iran's revolutionary message. The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon – in retaliation for Lebanon-based Palestinian attacks against Israel – provided Iran an opportunity to live up to its anti-Zionist rhetoric by challenging Israeli soldiers in Lebanon and checking U.S. influence in the region. Subsidizing conflict To that end, Iran sent its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – a branch of Iran's military, usually known as the ""Revolutionary Guard"" – to Lebanon to organize and support Lebanese and Palestinian militants. In Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, Revolutionary Guardsmen instructed Shiite resistance fighters in religion, revolutionary ideology and guerrilla tactics, and provided weapons, funds, training and encouragement. Iran's leadership transformed these early trainees from a ragtag band of fighters into Lebanon's most powerful political and military force today, and Iran's greatest foreign policy success, Hezbollah. Since the early 1980s, Iran has maintained support for anti-Israeli militant groups and operations. The Islamic Republic has publicly pledged millions of dollars of annual support to groups and provides advanced military training for thousands of Palestinian fighters at Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah bases in Iran and Lebanon. Iran runs a sophisticated smuggling network to funnel weapons into Gaza, which has long been cut off from the outside world by an Israeli blockade. Via the Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah, Iran has encouraged and enabled Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas violence, and these Palestinian fighters now represent a crucial element in what foreign affairs analysts call Iran's ""Axis of Resistance"" against Israel and the United States, which constitutes Iran's chief purpose. But Iran cannot risk confronting either state directly. Iranian weapons, funds and training enable surges in Palestinian militant violence against Israel when frustrations boil over, including during the Palestinian uprisings known as the first and second intifadas. Israeli-Palestinian conflicts and death tolls have escalated steadily since 2020. Palestinians are outraged by increased evictions and destruction of property, and how Israel allows Israeli nationalists and settlers to violate a long-standing agreement preventing Jewish prayer at the Al-Aqsa Mosque – a site holy to both Muslims and Jews. In fact, a recent incursion by settlers into Al-Aqsa was specifically cited by Hamas as a justification for the Oct. 7 attack. Attacking normalization That is not to say that Iran ordered Hamas' attack on Israel, nor that Iran controls Palestinian militants – they are not Iranian puppets. Nevertheless, Iran's leaders welcomed the attacks, the timing of which serendipitously works in Iran's favor and plays into the Islamic republic's regional battle for influence. ""What took place today is in line with the continuation of victories for the anti-Zionist resistance in different fields, including Syria, Lebanon and occupied lands,"" according to Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani. The week before the Hamas attack, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman denied reports that Saudi Arabia had paused its recent efforts to normalize relations with Israel, which includes a formal declaration of Israel's right to exist and increased diplomatic engagement. ""Every day we get closer,"" he said, an assessment praised and echoed by Netanyahu. Israeli-Saudi normalization would represent the pinnacle of achievement thus far in U.S. diplomatic efforts, including the Abraham Accords, signed by Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco in 2020. The accords aimed to normalize and build peaceful relations between Israel and Arab countries across the Middle East and in Africa. Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei lambasted Arab states for signing the Abraham Accords, accusing them of ""treason against the global Islamic community."" Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah praised Saturday's violence against Israel and echoed Khamenei's sentiments, warning that the attacks sent a message, ""especially to those seeking normalization with this enemy."" Israel's expected heavy-handed response is likely to complicate Saudi Arabia's normalization with Israel in the near term, furthering Iran's aims. Netanyahu said that Israel's retaliatory operation seeks three objectives: to eliminate the threat of infiltrators and restore peace to attacked Israeli communities, to simultaneously ""exact an immense price from the enemy"" in Gaza, and to reinforce ""other fronts so that nobody should mistakenly join this war."" This last objective is a subtle but clear warning to Hezbollah and Iran to stay out of the fight. Israeli troops have already mobilized to secure its borders, and airstrikes have hit Gaza. In all likelihood, Palestinian attackers will be killed or arrested in a matter of days. Israeli troops and air forces will target known or suspected rocket launch, manufacturing, storage and transportation sites, along with the homes of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members. But in the process, hundreds of civilians will likely also lose their lives. I believe that Iran expects and welcomes all of this. How Iran wins There are at least three possible outcomes to the war, and they all play in Iran's favor. First, Israel's heavy-handed response may turn off Saudi Arabia and other Arab states to U.S.-backed Israeli normalization efforts. Second, if Israel deems it necessary to push further into Gaza to eradicate the threat, this could provoke another Palestinian uprising in East Jerusalem or the West Bank, leading to a more widespread Israeli response and greater instability. Lastly, Israel could achieve its first two objectives with the minimal amount of force necessary, foregoing usual heavy-handed tactics and reducing chances of escalation. But this is unlikely. And even if this occurred, the underlying causes that led to this latest outbreak of violence, and the enabling role Iran plays in that process, have not been addressed. And when the next round of Israeli-Palestinian violence occurs – and it will – I believe Iran's leaders will again congratulate themselves for a job well done.","palestinian, israeli, the, islamic, revolutionary, iran, iranian, anti, israel, saudi, resistance, guard, aqsa, jihad, accords, shiite, normalization, khamenei, fighters, shah"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/harnessing-the-power-of-youth-a-shared-vision-for-nepal-and-india,Harnessing the Power of Youth: A Shared Vision for Nepal and India,Himalayan News Service,2025-01-29 22:12:53,"Brought by geography, culture, and history, Nepal and India share another profound connection: a youthful population. With a median age of around 28 in India, and 25 in Nepal, both nations are uniquely positioned to harness the potential of their youth to drive innovation, economic growth, and regional collaboration. Several existing initiatives already provide a strong foundation for fostering this partnership, but strengthening these programmes could unlock even greater possibilities for mutual progress. One such programme is the India-Nepal Youth Exchange Programme (YEP), which promotes cultural understanding and people-to-people connections between young leaders of the two nations. While this initiative has facilitated dialogue, its scope could include skill-sharing workshops, joint community projects, and mentorship programmes in entrepreneurship and climate action. For instance, including sessions on sustainable development or startup incubation could enhance the participants' skills and create a network of changemakers committed to solving regional challenges. Selected National Cadet Corps (NCC) cadets participate in YEP, which facilitates country-to-country exchanges among cadets from NCC and equivalent government youth organisations of friendly countries. This programme allows cadets to engage in various activities hosted by the partner country, fostering increased awareness and appreciation of each other's socio-economic and cultural realities. The Gandhi-Nepal Youth Awards, which recognise outstanding Nepali students and professionals excelling in India, exemplify how bilateral relationships can be celebrated and strengthened. Building on this platform, these awards could be extended to include categories like innovation, social impact, and cultural contributions, encouraging young people to excel in diverse fields while deepening ties between the two nations. Pairing award recipients with mentors or funding opportunities could further amplify their impact. Similarly, the SAARC Youth Charter, which provides a regional framework for youth collaboration, could be reinvigorated with India and Nepal taking the lead. The charter could be transformed into an action-oriented platform by focussing on regional issues like climate change, migration, and education. Joint youth-led initiatives under this banner could focus on projects such as reforestation in the Himalayas or developing educational technology tailored to underserved communities, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and achievement. In education, existing scholarship programmes for Nepali students in India have already created a robust academic bridge between the two nations. Thousands of Nepali students benefit annually from opportunities at Indian universities, but these programmes could be further enhanced. For example, expanding scholarships to include technical and vocational training in sectors like renewable energy, IT, and tourism would align with the economic priorities of both nations. Joint degree programmes or research collaborations between universities in India and Nepal could also foster innovation in addressing regional challenges. The entrepreneurial ecosystems in both countries offer another avenue for collaboration. India's Startup India initiative, known for nurturing young entrepreneurs, could inspire a cross-border framework to connect startup hubs in Nepal with resources, mentorship, and funding from India. Such collaborations could focus on areas like agritech, clean energy, and digital health - sectors critical to the shared future of both nations. A joint Innovation Fund could provide seed funding to cross-border startups, encouraging young entrepreneurs to work on solutions that benefit both societies. Sports and culture, too, offer opportunities for deepening youth collaboration. The success of Indian sports leagues like the IPL and ISL could inspire Nepal to build similar platforms, with India providing training and infrastructural support. Joint sports academies could also nurture talent, particularly in areas where both nations excel, such as cricket, football, and mountaineering. On the cultural front, initiatives like cross-border film festivals, collaborative music projects, and art residencies could create new avenues for young artists to showcase their work while fostering mutual appreciation and understanding. Scholarships play a crucial role in enhancing youth collaboration and educational exchange between India and Nepal, rooted in a long-standing partnership. The Indian government offers around 1,500 scholarships annually to Nepali nationals, benefiting over 27,000 students since 2006. These schemes cover a wide range of educational levels, from Class VI to PhD, and encompass diverse fields such as Engineering, Medicine, Agriculture, and the Arts. Key initiatives include the Mahatma Gandhi Scholarship Scheme for high school students in Nepal, and the Golden Jubilee Scholarship Scheme for undergraduate courses like MBBS and engineering. Additionally, prominent ICCR schemes like the Atal Bihari Vajpayee General Scholarship Scheme enable Nepali students to pursue higher education in prestigious Indian universities. This cultural and geographical proximity has made India a second home for many Nepali students, with scholarship programmes serving as a vital medium for fulfilling educational aspirations and fostering a network of young leaders equipped to address regional challenges.","scholarship, youth, startup, programmes, shared, scheme, students, educational, the, charter, programme, joint, cultural, cadet, corps, scholarships, innovation, awards, gandhi, indian"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/pashupatinath-temple-is-cornerstone-of-nepal-and-indias-cultural-spiritual-relationships,"'Pashupatinath Temple is cornerstone of Nepal and India's cultural, spiritual relationships'",Ram Kumar Kamat,2024-12-11 11:05:12,"Nestled along the sacred banks of the Bagmati River, the Pashupatinath Temple is not just an architectural marvel but also a spiritual epicentre for Hindus across the globe. Revered as the abode of Lord Shiva, the temple has stood as a testament to Nepal's profound spiritual heritage and cultural grandeur for centuries. It is not merely a pilgrimage site but a Tapo Bhumi – a place of deep meditation and divine resonance. Under the stewardship of the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT), efforts to preserve and enhance the temple's sanctity have reached new heights, reflecting a harmonious blend of tradition and modernity. Ram Kumar Kamat of The Himalayan Times spoke with the Executive Director of PADT Subhash Chandra Joshi to delve into the trust's vision for safeguarding this sacred shrine, promoting its spiritual legacy, and fostering global connections. Excerpts: THT: How do you perceive the significance of the pilgrimage to Pashupatinath Temple for both local and international visitors? The significance of Pashupatinath Temple lies in two key dimensions: spiritual and cultural. As the Aadi Guru (the first teacher), Lord Shiva represents the epitome of divine wisdom and guidance. For those seeking spiritual enlightenment or simply wishing to offer their devotion, Pashupatinath serves as the ultimate sanctum. It is a Tapo Bhumi-a sacred ground for meditation and devotion. The temple embodies the rich spiritual legacy Hindus share worldwide, symbolizing unity and cultural continuity. THT: Do we need to make people aware of the significance of Pashupatinath Temple? Absolutely. Awareness is vital. While residents who have lived near the temple for generations may inherently value its significance, extending this awareness to people beyond the immediate vicinity is essential. PADT cannot shoulder this responsibility alone; it requires a collective effort to highlight the temple's glory and importance in our spiritual and cultural fabric. The shared Hindu heritage that binds Nepal and India provides a powerful platform to amplify this message globally. THT: What role does Pashupatinath play in promoting cultural exchange between Nepal and India? Pashupatinath Temple is a cornerstone of Nepal and India's cultural and spiritual relationship, reflecting centuries of shared Hindu traditions. The tradition of appointing our Mul Bhattas (chief priests) from India underscores this enduring bond. Hindus worldwide, especially from India- the cradle of Sanatana Dharma-flock to Pashupatinath for worship. This exchange of devotion is more than symbolic; it fosters mutual respect, reinforces cultural solidarity, and underscores the unbreakable spiritual ties between the two nations. THT: How do you believe these renovations enhance the experience for pilgrims visiting Pashupatinath? Pilgrims and tourists expect to see the temple in its pristine, sacred state. For devotees, the opportunity to have an unhindered view of the deity is paramount. For tourists, the story of destruction and subsequent reconstruction adds a layer of historical intrigue. Renovation efforts ensure that these religious monuments continue to reflect the faith and identity they represent, allowing the temple to remain a beacon of Hindu spirituality and an embodiment of the collective devotion of millions. THT: In your opinion, what impact does improved infrastructure at pilgrimage sites have on local communities? Improved infrastructure has transformed the Pashupatinath Temple experience. Implementing the master plan, including making the core area vehicle-free, has brought two significant benefits. First, visitors can freely explore the temple's surroundings, enhancing their spiritual experience. Second, it protects the monuments from vibrations caused by vehicles, preserving their structural integrity. These improvements contribute to local economic growth, fostering prosperity that complements the temple's spiritual mission. THT: How important is it for Nepal and India to maintain strong ties regarding religious tourism? Faith and identity are the bedrock of Nepal and India's relationship. With shared religious traditions and the belief that visiting Pashupatinath is essential for a fulfilled life, the temple attracts countless Indian devotees annually. This pilgrimage strengthens Nepal-India ties, fostering a sense of Hindu solidarity and deepening cultural diplomacy. The temple represents a shared spiritual history and serves as a living bridge of mutual respect and cooperation between the two nations. THT: What feedback have you received from pilgrims regarding their experiences at Pashupatinath, especially after recent improvements? Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Pilgrims who visit after a long time often marvel at how spacious and accessible the temple has become. They particularly appreciate the ease of viewing the deity. Regular visitors provide valuable insights, pointing out areas for improvement and highlighting issues like cleanliness. We take their suggestions seriously, ensuring a continuous effort to improve their experience and to uphold the temple's stature as a global symbol of Hindu spirituality. THT: How do you see the relationship between pilgrimage tourism and economic growth in surrounding areas? Pilgrimage tourism significantly boosts the local economy, particularly in areas like Gaushala, where businesses cater to temple visitors. By linking Pashupatinath with other religious sites, we can create circuits encouraging longer stays, benefiting the tourism industry and the national economy. This approach not only enhances the spiritual journey of pilgrims but also reflects the interconnectedness of Nepal and India's cultural heritage. THT: What measures are taken to ensure local traditions and practices are respected during temple renovations? Respecting tradition is non-negotiable. Renovations follow strict guidelines from the Department of Archaeology to maintain the temple's original style. Multiple government bodies act as guardians to ensure that no alterations deviate from the cultural and historical integrity left by our ancestors. The adherence to Vastu Shastra further ensures that the temple remains an authentic representation of Hindu spirituality and architecture. THT: How can technology be utilized to enhance the pilgrimage experience for visitors? Technology offers incredible opportunities to connect with devotees worldwide. We are introducing E-puja services, allowing devotees to participate in rituals virtually and receive E-prasad. This initiative fosters a deeper connection with the temple and enhances accessibility for those unable to visit in person. By blending tradition with modernity, we ensure that Pashupatinath remains relevant in a digital age while staying true to its spiritual core. THT: How does the temple trust engage with local communities to promote awareness about the significance of Pashupatinath? PADT conducts outreach programs to engage local communities, fostering awareness of the temple's spiritual and cultural importance. These efforts emphasize collective responsibility, ensuring that the legacy of Pashupatinath continues to inspire generations. The temple serves as a unifying force for Nepal and the broader Hindu world, exemplifying the strength of shared cultural and spiritual values.","temple, spiritual, the, pilgrimage, cultural, pashupatinath, hindu, renovations, experience, shared, trust, sacred, significance, legacy, bhattas, mul, subhash, bhumi, tapo, traditions"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/nepal-and-china-officially-sign-bri-framework,Nepal and China officially sign BRI Framework,Bal Krishna Sah,2024-12-05 09:59:25,"KATHMANDU, DECEMBER 4 Nepali and Chinese officials signed the Chinese concept 'Belt and Road Initiative' (BRI) Cooperation Framework on Wednesday, which was the primary goal of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's visit to China. Although the details have not been entirely made available, Pradeep Gyawali, Deputy Secretary General of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli-led party, CPN-UML, has mentioned on social media which projects are included under the 'BRI Framework'. ""Foreign Secretary Amrit Rai and Vice Chairman of China's Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the BRI Cooperation Framework in Beijing,"" reads his post. According to him, the framework includes the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, Hilsa-Simikot Road Project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Geelong-Kerung-Kathmandu Cross Border Railway, Amargarhi City Hall at Dadeldhura, Geelong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi Chilime 220kV cross-border transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, and China-Nepal Industrial Friendship Park in Damak and Jhapa Sports and Athletics Complex. According to reports, the document seeks to prioritise 10 projects mentioned in the 'BRI Cooperation Framework' signed by officials from both countries. However, the signing was pushed back Tuesday due to disagreements over draft terminology. The discussion centred on whether to include the term grant in the financial cooperation modality. Following additional discussions, a consensus was reached on Wednesday, with both parties agreeing to use the term aid assistance financing. Prior to Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML could not find a mutual understanding on the BRI implementation framework until the last minute. Nepali Congress leaders had previously stated that they could not agree to take on additional loans from China. After the two parties reached an agreement on the same issue, a proposal was sent to China. According to reports, when the BRI framework is applied to Nepal, the two countries have agreed that the project will be carried out through the 'Aid' framework. Previously, following talks between PM Oli and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang in Beijing on Tuesday, officials from the two countries signed nine memoranda of understanding (MoUs), including economic cooperation, trade promotion and the construction of physical infrastructure. The MoUs include an agreement on economic and technical cooperation, a letter of exchange for the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, on trade promotion cooperation, a protocol agreement on essential elements for 'thermal' processing of buffalo meat for export from Nepal to China, a memorandum on development plan (year 2024-2029), a letter of exchange regarding financial support, and the handover of a certificate of completion of reconstruction of the nine-storey Basantpur Palace. An agreement has also been reached between Nepal Television, the Chinese Media Group, and volunteer Chinese language teachers. They did not include the term 'Belt and Road Initiative' (BRI) in the MoU. However, some of the aforementioned projects are also mentioned in the BRI cooperation framework signed by the two countries on Wednesday. In his address to a program held at Peking University, PM Oli shared the belief that China has strongly supported Nepal's development and the BRI project initiated under the visionary leadership of President Xi Jinping would further deepen bilateral relations between the two countries.","framework, bri, cooperation, the, oli, chinese, road, geelong, chhahare, kerung, sushe, basantpur, project, tokha, development, liu, aid, sharma, agreement, projects"

In his address to a programme held at Peking University, PM Oli expressed the belief that China has strongly supported Nepal's development and the BRI project initiated under the visionary leadership of President Xi Jinping would further deepen bilateral relations between the two countries. On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Nepal and China in 2025, PM Oli said that high-level visits would be exchanged between the two countries to add a new dimension to the bilateral relations.

Prakash Silwal, PM Press Coordinator, told the Himalayan Times that Trump's victory dominated the conversation. PM Oli congratulated President Trump through Musk, who was a key figure in the Trump election campaign and helped him take office in January. According to Silwal, who quoted him to THT, ""You played a decisive role in helping Trump win. I would like to congratulate Donald Trump through you. I believe that Nepal-US relations will reach new heights."" Musk thanked Oli. The discussion between them primarily revolved around the US election. Musk briefed PM Oli on Starlink. He also informed him of the benefits and facilities that would be available if it were used in Nepal. The PM said, ""We are interested in improving our digital infrastructure. The internet has become a critical tool for development, and we would be keen to explore Starlink's potential in providing high-speed internet to remote areas of Nepal."" Musk replied, ""Starlink's mission is to provide internet access to underserved and remote regions globally. Nepal's challenging terrain makes it an ideal candidate for Starlink. We would be happy to discuss further partnerships to enhance connectivity."" Despite the fact that the company may face difficulties entering Nepal under the country's current policies and regulations, SpaceX representatives have been working to create an environment conducive to providing services through the US Embassy in Nepal. Silwal also said, ""This is just the beginning; the PM would have meetings and work through the Embassy and diplomatic institutions for a conducive environment for collaboration."" PM Oli also emphasised SpaceX, another company of Musk in the space sector, saying that his vision for space exploration with SpaceX has inspired many young minds. ""We want to encourage our youth to dream big and pursue careers in technology and science,"" Oli said to Musk. Musk replied, ""Inspiring the next generation is vital. Space exploration isn't just about going to Mars; it's about pushing the boundaries of what humanity can achieve. I'd be glad to see more Nepali students and innovators contributing to this global mission."" The Starlink delegation previously met with PM Oli and presented and demonstrated its services. The team, which included Starlink's Global Licencing and Marketing Director Rebecca Slick Hunter, met with the PM and provided a formal assurance regarding the company's services, technical aspects, market strategy, Nepal entry plan, and cyber and data security aspects. According to reports, the American team delivered a presentation on how Starlink's internet service works and how important it is in Nepali geography. Musk also reiterated in his brief conversation with Oli on November 22 that Nepal's difficult terrain makes it an ideal candidate for Starlink. PM Oli also invited Musk to visit Nepal during the meeting. Taking to Musk-owned social media 'X', formerly known as Twitter, Oli said, ""A short while ago, during my conversation with Mr. Elon Musk, I extended an invitation for him to visit Nepal.""","starlink, trump, musk, conversation, internet, the, elon, space, hunter, slick, rebecca, oli, exploration, terrain, aspects, company, us, pm, licencing, mission"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/new-agenda-for-peace-why-cant-nepal-take-the-lead-in-the-effort,New Agenda for Peace: Why can't Nepal take the lead in the effort?,Simone Galimberti,2024-08-20 15:27:39,"Violence. The more I read the news these days the more I cannot escape to think about this word. Apparently, we are on the tip of a major regional conflict in the Middle East, an extension of the brutal war between Hamas and Israel. Bangladesh is in turmoil, the biggest crisis since its independence. Myanmar is still mired in a bloody civil conflict. This is just what's happening in our neighbourhood without forgetting the more than occasional acts of terrorisms unfolding in Pakistan. In Afghanistan there is an ongoing, unrelenting campaign of violence against women. Going beyond the South Asian region, there are multiple conflicts going on. Several of them are also easily brushed aside and simply neglected by the international community and media alike. Think about the civil war in Sudan or the violence going in the North Kivu region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Then there is Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Even England is mired by far-right violence against migrants. All these examples do represent different situations in very different circumstances, and we cannot come to easy generalisations nor simplifications of very complex regional and localised issues. Yet, though dissimilar from each other, volatile situations can rapidly evolve and spiral out of control. On top of this landscape, there are serious geopolitical fractures among the super powers. Tensions and rivalries are rising exponentially, and we cannot overlook the possibility that in a medium or long-term scenario, such contentious relationships could derail and turn into the most unimaginable sources of deaths. The most recent annual report of The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) highlights how the nine nuclear armed nations are continuing expanding their nuclear arsenals. Apparently nuclear deterrence can only happen by having nations scaling up their arms modernisation drive rather than by sharing a resolute commitment of never deploying such self-destructive tools. And yes, we cannot forget the probability of AI driven killer robots, as most powerful nations are investing unprecedented resources to deploy into conflict automated dangerous machines. I do not want to be overly pessimistic nor provide only a gloomy view of the international state of the world. I do not believe we are getting closer to any major new world war, but it is unquestionable that humanity is facing serious challenges and that, too often, such ""tests"" do turn themselves into violent and deadly affairs. Nepal, fortunately, is not facing any imminent risks of war nor is there a chance of any political disagreement or protest in the country getting out of control as in Bangladesh. Somehow the country is a passive spectator of what's happening around the world. It is true that on many occasions the political leaders do preach peace and friendly relationships among nations. Yet such statements are devoid of real substance and therefore are not taken seriously. These, after all, are the key cornerstones of Nepal's strategic approach to its foreign policy, but there is no doubt that the country could have a much bigger role in the international scene as a promoter of peace. Let's not forget that there are much smaller nations that have been taking a prominent leadership in the field of climate action. Think of Vanuatu and Barbados for example. Can't Nepal be more proactive in fostering diplomacy over conflicts? Can't the country become bolder in asserting the supremacy of peaceful conflict resolutions over the use of arms? It's true that the country is one of the biggest contributors of peace-keepers at the United Nations, but this is not enough. At the diplomatic level, Nepal could, politically speaking, do more and assume a more prominent role. There is a platform for Nepal to assert its voice as mediator and peace promoter: the New Agenda for Peace that the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, presented last July. It is an ambitious and highly idealistic blueprint that has both global and level outlooks: it tries to promote dialogue to prevent global, catastrophic conflicts while also offering tools to prevent and reduce the risks of escalations locally. It is so comprehensive and holistic that it recognises the paramount role of women in the promotion of peace and also takes stock of the high probabilities of more and more conflicts over resources caused by climate warming. Why can't Nepal become one of the strongest ambassadors of this ambitious agenda? The country, let's not forget, is also a beacon of democracy and respect for human rights, and could take the lead in international forums to help influence other nations in agreeing on the key cornerstones of the New Agenda for Peace. The country could become an important partner of Guterres's attempts at creating a consensus around it. The upcoming Summit of the Future that is to be held in September in New York, will discuss, among other crucial areas of policy making, also practical ways to promote peace and reduce conflicts by endorsing the New Agenda for Peace. It is true that political instability in Kathmandu is an undeniable impediment for Nepal in gaining a stronger standing in the international arena. But as the major political parties in the country are able to work together on some of the most intricate issues like transitional justice or in presenting a common front in trying to attract foreign investments, then it is not impossible to have such a principled bipartisan approach also in foreign policy. Isn't it worth trying envisioning such a scenario? Nepal, which just over 15 years ago was in a bloody civil conflict, is turning itself into one of the strongest promoters of peace around the world. What a wonderful development it would be for a country that is too often taken for granted, discounted and simply considered as a minnow always begging for money.","the, agenda, nations, peace, conflict, kivu, such, conflicts, international, promoter, scenario, violence, situations, relationships, nuclear, guterres, policy, war, new, role"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/new-protests-in-bangladesh-keep-the-pressure-on-the-government-after-200-were-killed-in-violence,New protests in Bangladesh keep the pressure on the government after 200 were killed in violence,Associated Press,2024-08-02 21:48:23,"DHAKA, AUGUST 2 New protests erupted in Bangladesh on Friday against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government, demanding accountability after more than 200 people were killed last month in violent demonstrations following weeks of rallies over controversial reforms in the job quota system. Over 2,000 protesters gathered in parts of the capital, Dhaka, some shouting ""down with the autocrat"" and demanding justice for victims. Police and dozens of students clashed in Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood. Security officers fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse stone-throwing protesters. In the southwestern district of Khulna, police also fired tear gas and rubber bullets, injuring 50 protesters, the Dhaka-based English-language Daily Star reported. The paper said 50 were also injured in clashes in the northeastern district of Habiganj after an arson attack on a local office of the ruling Awami League party. In the southeastern city of Chattogram, about 1,000 protesters held a procession after Friday prayers and set a roadside police guard post on fire, the report said. The student protests against the government, which show no signs of dying down, started as a peaceful demonstration against a quota system allocating government jobs but morphed into an unprecedented challenge and rebellion against Hasina, whose 15-year-long dominance over the country is now being tested like never before. Hasina, 76, was elected for a fourth consecutive term in January in a vote boycotted by her main opponents, making the result a near certainty even before votes were counted. Since the violence erupted on July 15, authorities have shut off the internet and enforced a shoot-on-sight curfew. Schools and universities remain closed. Dramatic videos of deadly clashes between police and protesters have shaken Bangladesh, as has the case of a six-year-old girl who was shot while playing on a rooftop while her father unsuccessfully tried to shield her from the firing. The wave of discontent started with students, frustrated by shortages of good jobs, demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs that they argued was discriminatory. Under the system, 30% of such jobs were reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence against Pakistan in 1971. They said it benefited supporters of Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and wanted it replaced with a merit-based system. The Supreme Court scaled back the veterans' quota to 5% but protests continued, something experts say reflects more widespread anger against the government and economic discontent. ""There have been plenty of protests during the Awami League's regime over the last 15 years, but nothing as large, long, and violent as this one,"" said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington. This time, there appeared to be a perfect storm, Kugelman added - an unpopular quota system, a ferocious government response that turned deadly, pent-up anger against the state and growing economic stress felt by the majority of citizens. Also, the heavy-handed crackdown, mixing force and some negotiations, has only ""inflamed the protests instead of extinguishing them,"" Kugelman said. The furor has also highlighted the extent of economic discontent in Bangladesh, once hailed for its growth success story. Like other countries, it suffered following the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which drove up prices of commodities. Exports fell and foreign exchange reserves and remittances are running low. There's a lack of quality jobs for young graduates, who now increasingly seek the more stable and lucrative government jobs. The discontent drove many students out on the streets - and the government's violent response kept them there, even as the quota system was scaled back. Groups of students, teachers and civil society members say they are now fighting for justice for those who have been killed, while Hasina's political opponents demand her resignation. Mohammad Rakib Uddin was protesting with hundreds of other students and wearing his college uniform when bullets pierced his hip. The 18-year-old said he survived after his friends rushed him to the hospital. ""They have brutally and inhumanely attacked us ... we don't have weapons, bombs or even a stick in our hands,"" he said. ""By the grace of the Almighty, I am alive."" The United Nations and the United States have criticized the authorities' crackdown. The government says armed opposition supporters infiltrated the students to attack security officials and state-owned establishments. After weeks, the violence subsided and a semblance of normalcy is slowly returning. The curfew has been relaxed, the internet is back on and banks and offices have reopened. But the turmoil continues to swirl around Hasina. Her critics say the unrest is a result of her authoritarian streak and hunger for control at all costs. Human rights groups blame her for using security forces and courts to suppress dissent and opposition, which the government denies. For her part, Hasina is blaming the two main opposition parties - which have backed the students - of fueling the violence. Her government on Thursday banned one of them, the Jamaat-e-Islami party, its student wing and other associate bodies. Though that may again escalate tensions, Kugelman doesn't see a threat to Hasina's political survival though she ""faces unprecedented political vulnerability."" ""That could come back to haunt her if there are fresh waves of anti-government protests in the coming weeks or months,"" he added. Nur Sharmin says her family's lives are at a standstill. Her 16-year-old daughter's school has closed down and the 35-year-old mother is afraid to step out of her home on most days. ""My daughter needs a safe country to grow up in, it's her right,"" she siad. ""We are not asking for much.""","the, her, awami, quota, jobs, government, hasina, dhaka, protesters, system, year, old, league, protests, security, anger, crackdown, discontent, opponents, students"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/bangladeshs-top-court-scales-back-government-jobs-quota-after-deadly-unrest-killed-scores,Bangladesh's top court scales back government jobs quota after deadly unrest killed scores,Associated Press,2024-07-21 14:44:42,"DHAKA, JULY 21 Bangladesh's top court on Sunday scaled back a controversial quota system for government job applicants, in a partial victory for student protesters after days of nationwide unrest and deadly clashes between police and demonstrators that have killed scores of people. Students, frustrated by shortages of good jobs, have been demanding an end to a quota that reserved 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. The government previously halted it in 2018 following mass student protests, but in June, Bangladesh's High Court reinstated the quotas and set off a new round of protests. Ruling on an appeal, the Supreme Court ordered that the veterans' quota be cut to 5%, with 93% of jobs to be allocated on merit. The remaining 2% will be set aside for members of ethnic minorities and transgender and disabled people. The protests have posed the most serious challenge to Bangladesh's government since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won a fourth consecutive term in January elections that were boycotted by the main opposition groups. Universities have been closed, the internet has been shut off and the government has ordered people to stay at home. The protests turned deadly on Tuesday, a day after students at Dhaka University began clashing with police. Violence continued to escalate as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and hurled smoke grenades to scatter stone-throwing protesters. Bangladeshi authorities haven't shared any official numbers of those killed and injured, but the Daily Prothom Alo newspaper reported Saturday that at least 103 people have died so far. Sporadic clashes in some parts of Dhaka, the capital, were reported on Saturday but it was not immediately clear whether there were any fatalities. Ahead of the Supreme Court hearing, soldiers patrolled cities across the South Asian country. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said the stay at home order will be relaxed from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday for people to run essential errands. Meanwhile, the government has declared Sunday and Monday as public holidays, with only emergency services allowed to operate. Protesters argue the quota system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, saying it should be replaced with a merit-based system. Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war against Pakistan, regardless of their political affiliation. Representatives from both sides met late Friday in an attempt to reach a resolution and Law Minister Anisul Huq said the government was open to discussing their demands. Their demands included the reform of the current quota system, the reopening of student dormitories shut by the police following the clashes and for some university officials to step down after failing to protect campuses from the violence. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protests, vowing to organize its own demonstrations as many of its supporters have joined the student-led protests. However, BNP said in a statement its followers were not responsible for the violence and denied the ruling party's accusations of using the protests for political gains. The Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures. Hasina's government had accused the opposition party of attempting to disrupt the vote.","quota, the, court, bangladesh, awami, protests, opposition, clashes, asaduzzaman, government, party, dhaka, protesters, prothom, alo, jobs, anisul, huq, student, system"

The curfew follows what was likely the deadliest day yet in the weeks of protests despite a ban on public gatherings. Reports vary on the number of people killed Friday, with Somoy TV reporting 43. An Associated Press reporter saw 23 bodies at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, but it was not immediately clear whether they all died on Friday. Another 22 people died Thursday as protesting students attempted to impose a ""complete shutdown"" of the country. Several people were also killed Tuesday and Wednesday. The protests, which began weeks ago but escalated sharply when violence erupted Tuesday, represent the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after elections in January that were boycotted by the main opposition groups. Police and protesters clashed in the streets and at university campuses in Dhaka and other cities across the south Asian country. Authorities moved to block online communications by banning mobile and internet services. Some television news channels also went off the air, and the websites of most Bangladesh newspapers were not loading or were being updated. Authorities could not be reached immediately to confirm figures for the overall deaths, but the Daily Prothom Alo newspaper reported 103 people were killed since Tuesday. The United States Embassy in Dhaka said Friday that reports indicated ""hundreds to possibly thousands"" were injured across Bangladesh. It said the situation was ""extremely volatile."" Local media also reported that some 800 inmates fled from a prison in Narsingdi, a district north of capital Dhaka, after protesters stormed the jail facility and set it on fire Friday. Meanwhile, ome key government websites, including that of Bangladesh's central bank and the prime minister's office, appeared to have been defaced by hackers. The curfew began at midnight and is set to relax from noon to 2 p.m. to allow people to buy essentials before being put back in place until 10 a.m. Sunday. A ""shoot-at-sight"" order was also in place, giving security forces the authority to fire on mobs in extreme cases, said lawmaker Obaidul Quader, the general secretary of the ruling Awami League party. The chaos highlights cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy and the frustration of youths who lack good jobs upon graduation. The protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan. They argue the system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, and they want it replaced with a merit-based system. Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions to the war, regardless of their political affiliation. Representatives from the both sides met late Friday to find a resolution. At least three student leaders were part of the meeting in which they demanded a reform in the quota system, an opening of student dormitories across the country and the stepping down of university officials for failing to prevent violence on the campuses. Law Minister Anisul Huq said the government was open to discussing the student leaders' demands. The protests are also backed by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party that has vowed to organize its own demonstrations with many of its supporters joining in the students' protests. A BNP statement Friday said its supporters were not responsible for the violence and the party does not support any sabotage for political reasons. The Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the country's national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures while Hasina's government accused the party of attempting to disrupt the vote. Earlier, Hasina's government had halted the job quotas following mass student protests in 2018. But in June, Bangladesh's High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of 1971 veterans filed petitions. The Supreme Court suspended the ruling, pending an appeal hearing, and said in a statement it will take the issue up Sunday. Hasina has called on protesters to wait for the court's verdict.","the, bangladesh, dhaka, awami, court, protests, student, quader, obaidul, hasina, party, quota, prothom, alo, jobs, bnp, huq, anisul, quotas, system"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/heres-what-to-know-about-the-violent-protests-over-government-jobs-roiling-bangladesh,Here's what to know about the violent protests over government jobs roiling Bangladesh,Associated Press,2024-07-20 00:07:30,"DHAKA, JULY 19 Bangladesh has been gripped by violence this week after relentless clashes between student protesters, security officials and pro-government student activists over a quota system for government jobs. Protest organizers say they are imposing ""a complete shutdown"" across Bangladesh on Thursday, except for essential services. This comes after several major universities in the country agreed to shut their doors indefinitely until tensions ease. Here's what we know: What's happened so far? The protests, which have drawn tens of thousands out on the streets, began late last month but tensions escalated on Monday when student activists at Dhaka University, the country's largest, clashed with police and counter-protesters backed by the ruling Awami League. At least 100 people were injured in the aftermath. The next day, as violence continued to roil campuses across Bangladesh, six people were killed. More clashes were also reported on Wednesday and Thursday and paramilitary forces were deployed to patrol the streets of major cities. Media reports said at least 19 more people died on Thursday. In response, major universities said they will close until the situation is resolved in order to protect students. The protesters say they will continue to demonstrate but are open to discussions with the government. More violence took place on Thursday in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country as police fired tear gas at protesters, according to police officials and local television. Why are they protesting? At the heart of the demonstrations is a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan. Protesters want to abolish this system, which they say is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party, which led the independence movement. They want it replaced with a system that's based on merit. Even though job opportunities have grown in some parts of the private sector, many people prefer government jobs because they are seen as more stable and lucrative. But there aren't enough to go around - each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam. Under the quota system, government jobs are also reserved for women, disabled people and members of ethnic minorities, but students have mainly protested against jobs reserved for veterans' families. What does the government say? Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war regardless of their political affiliation. Her government has also accused the main opposition parties, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the right wing Jamaat-e-Islami party, of fueling chaos. The BNP has backed the students' calls for shutdown on Thursday. On Wednesday, authorities also raided the headquarters of the BNP and arrested several activists from the party's student wing. The clashes come months after Hasina maintained power in an election that was boycotted by opposition parties and saw opposition members jailed ahead of the polls. Why are the students protesting now? This isn't the first time there's been uproar over this issue. In 2018, Hasina's government halted the quotas after mass student protests. However, the High Court nullified that decision last month and reinstated the quotas after relatives of the 1971 veterans filed petitions, sparking the latest round of protests. The Supreme Court suspended that decision and promised to rule on the issue on Aug. 7. Despite this, the protests have persisted. ""I am requesting all to wait with patience until the verdict is delivered,"" Hasina said in a televised address Wednesday evening. ""I believe our students will get justice from the apex court. They will not be disappointed."" What could happen next? The furore has also highlighted cracks in Bangladesh's governance and economy following the pandemic and global upheaval of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and reflect a lack of good quality jobs available for young graduates. ""The reason behind such huge participation is that many students go through the bitter experience of not finding the jobs they deserve after completing their education,"" wrote Anu Muhammad, a former economics professor and analyst, in the Dhaka-based Daily Star newspaper. ""In addition, rampant corruption and irregularities in government job recruitment exams and selection processes have created immense frustration and anger."" ""The country's economy shows growth, but jobs are not being created,"" he wrote. Hasnat Abdullah, a protest coordinator, said the students want to return to classes but will do so once their demands are met. On Thursday afternoon, Bangladesh's Law Minister Anisul Huq said that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asked him to sit with the protesters for a dialogue, and he was ready to sit down on Thursday if protesters were willing.","the, awami, bangladesh, hasina, dhaka, protesters, party, jobs, protests, student, clashes, activists, anisul, huq, jamaat, bnp, islami, students, court, sheikh"

They drove in cars to reach a border point at Akhaura in Brahmanbaria district to register their protest. Before starting for the border area, they rallied briefly in Dhaka where leaders criticized what they called ""Indian aggression"" against Bangladesh. The party headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia has been protesting against the attack by a mob of Hindus in the northeastern Indian state of Agartala on Dec. 2. On the way to the border area, the entourage stopped at places where waiting supporters of Zia welcomed them and rallied briefly on Wednesday. Another rally will be held when the team reaches the border point. Wednesday's protest came two days after the foreign secretaries of Bangladesh and India held bilateral meetings in Bangladesh's capital to defuse escalating tensions between the two neighbors. It was the first high-profile diplomatic visit by an Indian official since the fall of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is in exile in India, in August. Bangladesh, which is predominantly Muslim, has accused a group of Hindus in India of attacking the Assistant High Commissioner's office at Agartala and desecrating Bangladeshi flags in Kolkata in West Bengal state. India said it regretted the attacks and pledged to take action against those responsible. Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Indian High Commissioner and formally registered its protest. Tensions between the two neighbors also spiked over the recent arrest of a Hindu leader in Bangladesh, currently run by the interim government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus. India stopped issuing visas to Bangladeshis except for emergency medical purposes after Hasina's ouster, while many Indian nationals taking part in infrastructure projects left Bangladesh because of security threats. Protests were also held in parts of Hindu-majority India to denounce attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh. Protests and counter-protests have strained the relations between the two countries. In Bangladesh, reports of the desecration of the Indian flag, with some burning it and others laying it on the floor for people to step on, strained relations further.","indian, the, desecration, protest, hasina, bangladesh, border, zia, khaleda, party, commissioner, bengal, nobel, yunus, tensions, muhammad, nationalist, dhaka, hindu, supporters"

City dropped to 22nd place in the 36-team standings, with only the top 24 advancing. Progressing to the next round of the new-look format looked a certainty before the season for a team that was European champion in 2023 and has won the last four Premier League titles. But not anymore as City manager Pep Guardiola battles injuries and an apparent loss of belief among his players. City has won just one of its last 10 matches in all competitions, with goals by Dušan Vlahović and Weston McKennie inflicting the latest defeat and igniting Juventus' qualification hopes. City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan described the team's problem as a ""mental issue."" Opponents ""are able to break our rhythm with the smallest of things,"" Gundogan said. ""They don't even need to do much and it has such a big effect on us right now."" Barcelona jumped into second place in the league standings, behind Liverpool, and is guaranteed to advance after a 3-2 win at Borussia Dortmund. Raphinha and Ferran Torres, with two goals, scored for Barca. Arsenal beat Monaco 3-0 mainly thanks to two goals by Bukayo Saka to move into third place and be the highest of six teams on 13 points. The top eight qualify directly for the last 16 and the teams placed No. 9-24 go into a two-legged playoff. Danger for City City has two games to save its faltering Champions League campaign and the first is against Paris Saint-Germain, another giant in trouble in 25th place - one spot out of the qualifying positions. Vlahović put Juventus ahead in the 53rd when he powered a header goalward straight at City goalkeeper Ederson, who could only parry the ball over his own line. Two American substitutes sealed the win for Juve, with McKennie volleying home from Timothy Weah's cross. Juventus moved into 14th place. Super-sub Torres Ferran Torres came off the bench to inspire Barcelona to a fifth win in six games and push Dortmund, last season's runner-up, out of the top eight. Torres came on in the 71st to replace Robert Lewandowski, who had a quiet game against his former club. Just four minutes later, Torres scored a goal on the rebound from Dani Olmo's shot. Serhou Guirassy's second goal of the game leveled the score at 2-2 but Torres scored again in the 85th off Lamine Yamal's pass on the counter. Raphinha gave Barcelona the lead before Guirassy equalized from the penalty spot. Raphinha and Guirassy are tied for second place in the scoring chart on six goals, behind Lewandowski's competition-high seven. Home comforts for Arsenal Arsenal secured a third straight home win without conceding in the league stage, with Saka scoring in the 34th and 78th minutes and sending in a shot that was turned into the net by substitute Kai Havertz in the 88th. Arsenal is ahead of Bayer Leverkusen, Aston Villa, Inter Milan, Brest and Lille on goal difference. Lille won 3-2 at home to Sturm Graz on Wednesday. In-form Alvarez Man City could sure do with Julian Alvarez at the moment. With a brilliant curling finish to open the scoring, the Argentina striker helped Atletico Madrid beat Slovan Bratislava 3-1 and provide a timely reminder of what City is missing after selling him for more than $100 million in August. Alvarez has 12 goals for the season, with four coming in the Champions League. Antoine Griezmann scored Atletico's other two goals at Metropolitano stadium as the Spanish team climbed to 11th place after a 10th straight win in all competitions. Tribute to grieving teammate When Lukasz Lakomy gave Young Boys the lead against Stuttgart, he ran toward the sideline and held up teammate Meschack Elia's jersey as others gathered around him. The gesture was a tribute after Elia's son died unexpectedly this week after a short illness. Elia wasn't playing as he was on his way to his native Congo, where his son died, to be with his family. Both teams wore black armbands and there was a moment of silence before the game, which was won 5-1 by Stuttgart. Late winner Tammy Abraham scored an 87th-minute winner as AC Milan beat Red Star Belgrade 2-1 to move one point off the top eight. Milan lost Alvaro Morata and Ruben Loftus-Cheek to muscle injuries in the first half. Benfica's five-match winning streak ended with a 0-0 home draw against Bologna, and Feyenoord had a 4-2 win over Sparta Prague.","torres, the, league, city, elia, win, ferran, champions, place, tammy, meschack, weah, alvarez, serhou, guirassy, goals, timothy, olmo, havertz, abraham"

Bizarre penalty dooms Aston Villa",Associated Press,2024-11-07 21:39:55,"MADRID, NOVEMBER 7 Barcelona and Inter Milan won again in the Champions League on Wednesday though both former title holders are looking up in the standings toward upstart newcomer Brest. Aston Villa started the week atop the 36-team table but its winning run ended after a bizarre penalty was awarded when defender Tyrone Mings picked up the ball in the area at Club Brugge, resulting in a 1-0 loss that sent the English club plummeting to eighth place. Paris Saint-Germain, in its first season without Kylian Mbappé, trails far behind in 25th after Atletico Madrid scored in stoppage time to seal a 2-1 win for the Spanish team at Parc des Princes. Barcelona's blistering scoring form continued in a 5-2 win at Red Star Belgrade - a seventh straight win since the start of October at a rate of four goals per game. Robert Lewandowski scored twice and has 21 this season. Inter Milan stifled Arsenal in a 1-0 win at San Siro sealed by Hakan Çalhanoğlu's penalty in first-half stoppage time. Inter is unbeaten on 10 points and in fifth place, one below Brest which won 2-1 at Sparta Prague. The French debutant looks sure to advance to the knockout phase starting in February. Atalanta won 2-0 at Stuttgart to stay unbeaten on eight points and Salzburg got its first goals and points in a 3-1 win at Feyenoord. Bayern Munich won 1-0 at home to Benfica in a game that was delayed 15 minutes by crowd congestion and then was played in a muted atmosphere because of a medical incident for a fan. Shakhtar Donetsk playmaker Heorhiy Sudakov had a fine assist and an even better goal in a 2-1 win for the Ukrainian champion against Young Boys. Shakhtar's No. 10 showed why he is expected to be the club's next big-money sale. Liverpool, which on Tuesday routed Bayer Leverkusen 4-0, leads the standings at the midway point of the eight-round program. Liverpool is the only team with four straight wins, while five teams have four losses. They are Leipzig, Sturm Graz, Young Boys, Red Star and Slovan Bratislava. Two Italian teams – Inter Milan and Atalanta – have yet to concede a goal in four games. Another Italian side, Bologna, is the only team with no goals scored. Villa slides Villa had led the standings in the new league-phase format after three straight wins without conceding a goal - and it took a bizarre incident before goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez was eventually beaten. Mings was punished for picking up the ball when Martínez seemed to restart play with a goal kick passed forward to his teammate. Mings walked a couple steps to gather the ball with his left hand and returned to place it in the six-yard box. ""It's the biggest mistake I witnessed in my career,"" Villa coach Unai Emery said. ""It has only happened one time in all my life. Today."" Brugge captain Hans Vanaken placed the 52nd-minute spot-kick to Martínez's left as the World Cup-winning Argentina goalkeeper dived to his right. Bayern and Dinamo It was the standout result of the inaugural week of the new Champions League in September: Bayern Munich 9, Dinamo Zagreb 2. It was the first time a team had scored nine times in a game in the 32-year Champions League era, and Dinamo fired its coach two days later. Since then? Bayern lost twice, including a 4-1 rout at Barcelona, and Dinamo won twice. At the end of play Wednesday, Bayern was 17th on six points, one place below Dinamo on seven. If those placings hold until January, they meet again twice more in the knockout playoffs round. Next up The fifth round in three weeks' time has perhaps the stellar attraction of 144 games in the league phase: Liverpool vs. Real Madrid. That game on Nov. 27 is a rematch of the 2022 and 2018 finals, both won by Madrid, and the 1981 European Cup title match that Liverpool won. There is another final rematch: Bayern Munich hosts PSG on Nov. 26 in a repeat of the pandemic-season final played in August 2020 without fans in Lisbon. Also, sixth-place Barcelona hosts Brest, a fixture which might have been overlooked when the draw was made in August yet the French team is currently fourth. Only the top eight teams in January advance directly to the round of 16 in March.","the, league, martínez, brest, madrid, bizarre, hans, heorhiy, sudakov, vanaken, hakan, mings, çalhanoğlu, tyrone, emiliano, win, club, shakhtar, champions, villa"

Defending champion Madrid was humbled 3-1 at home by AC Milan, while Erling Haaland missed a penalty and City squandered a fourth-minute lead as it lost 4-1 at Sporting Lisbon, whose coach will soon take charge of its crosstown rival. It was a much better evening for Liverpool, as Luis Diaz scored a hat trick and Cody Gakpo grabbed another goal in a 4-0 win over German champion Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield that marred Xabi Alonso's return to his old home. The Leverkusen coach was given a warm welcome on his return to the club where he became a fan favorite as a player over five seasons between 2004-09. Alonso won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005. Liverpool moved top of the league phase table with four wins from four games, followed by Sporting and Monaco, both on 10 points after three wins and a draw. Under the new 36-team format introduced by UEFA this season, the top eight teams advance directly to the next round, and those from ninth to 24th enter playoffs to reach it, while the bottom 12 are eliminated. Amorim's audition Before their game, Sporting fans displayed a huge tifo thanking Rúben Amorim in his last home game before he takes over Manchester United. Phil Foden then got City off to a flying start in the fourth minute, only the second goal Sporting has conceded in four games of the competition. But Swedish forward Viktor Gyökeres scored a hat trick as Sporting came roaring back. Gyökeres first equalized in the 38th after a perfect through ball from Geovany Quenda, before Maximiliano Araújo made it 2-1 right after the break. Gyökeres then made it 3-1 from the penalty spot after Joško Gvardiol was penalized for a shove on Francisco Trincão in the area. Haaland's penalty hit the crossbar, before Gyökeres showed the Norwegian how it's done with another spot kick at the other end to complete the scoring. It is the first time since 2018 that City has lost three straight games, coming off a defeat to Tottenham in the English League Cup and a loss to Bournemouth in the Premier League. ""In my seven and a half years at the club, I don't remember losing three games in a row,"" City midfielder Bernardo Silva said. Madrid faltering In Spain, Christian Pulisic sent in a corner for Malick Thiaw to head Milan into a 12th-minute lead, ensuring Madrid trailed in a third straight game in the Champions League this season. The 15-time champion had already lost to surprise team Lille in their second game. Vinícius Júnior equalized from the penalty spot in the 23rd after he'd been tripped, but Álvaro Morata pounced on the rebound after Andriy Lunin saved Rafael Leão's shot to restore the visitors' lead against his former club. Morata had already been given a hostile reception from the home fans, who evidently remember the goal he scored to take Juventus through to the 2015 final at their team's expense. Tijjani Reijnders scored Milan's third goal as the home fans made their frustrations known at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. ""The last two defeats are inexplicable. We have to analyze and react quickly,"" Lunin said, referring to Madrid's 4-0 loss to Barcelona in its previous Spanish league game. It's the first time since 2009 that Madrid has lost two successive games at home with at least three goals conceded in each, according to Opta. ""We have to get back on track,"" Lunin said. Other results German forward Nicolas Kühn scored twice as Celtic defeated Leipzig 3-1 at home, and Juventus drew 1-1 at Lille. Lille midfielder Edon Zhegrova eluded two defenders before playing a perfect pass for Jonathan David, who fired inside the far post, but Dušan Vlahović equalized with a penalty for the Italian club. Donyell Malen scored late for Borussia Dortmund to beat Sturm Graz 1-0 at home, and Thilo Kehrer did likewise for Monaco to win at Bologna 1-0. United States midfielder Malik Tillman scored one goal and set up another as PSV Eindhoven beat Spanish team Girona 4-0. Dinamo Zagreb dealt Slovan Bratislava its fourth straight defeat in the competition as the visitors came from behind to win 4-1 in Bratislava.","the, league, alonso, minute, goal, leverkusen, gyökeres, leão, bernardo, game, xabi, viktor, games, fourth, madrid, penalty, rafael, defeats, sporting, amorim"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/arne-slot-humbles-xabi-alonso-as-liverpool-routs-bayer-leverkusen-4-0-in-the-champions-league,Arne Slot humbles Xabi Alonso as Liverpool routs Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 in the Champions League,Associated Press,2024-11-07 10:25:17,"LIVERPOOL, NOVEMBER 6 Arne Slot vs. Xabi Alonso had the makings of an epic battle. In the end it was the Liverpool coach who cruised to victory against the man many believed was destined to take over at Anfield this season. A hat trick from Luis Diaz and a goal from Cody Gakpo saw Liverpool beat German champion Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday and further endear Slot to the Merseyside club's fans, who joyously sang his name at the end. ""People singing for a manager is not that common, at least not in Holland,"" Slot said. It all seems so easy for the Dutchman, who replaced Jurgen Klopp in the summer and has led Liverpool to the top of the Premier League and now the Champions League after an outstanding start to his reign. That's win number 14 from his 16 games in charge, but this felt particularly symbolic, given his rival in the opposition dugout. Slot seems too level-headed to have concerned himself with the subplot of facing Alonso, who is arguably the most sought-after young coach in Europe and someone who was considered a leading candidate to succeed Klopp at Liverpool. A former Champions League-winning player for the club, the stars seemed to align when Klopp made the surprise announcement in January that he would step down at the end of last season. At that time Alonso was well on the way to leading Leverkusen to an undefeated domestic campaign and a German league and cup double. Slot's name seemed a long way from the conversation. Wind the clock forward and Alonso, who was also linked another his former clubs, Bayern Munich, shut down talk of moving anywhere when declaring he would remain at Leverkusen. Liverpool looked elsewhere, Slot was the man chosen to succeed Klopp and it could hardly have gone better for him or the club. The former Feyenoord coach is making light work of filling the void left by an Anfield icon and one of the most successful managers of his generation. These are early days, but Liverpool looks ready to challenge for the biggest titles right from the off under the new manager. Instead of feeling the pressure of living up to the standards set by Klopp, who won a full set of trophies, including the Premier League and Champions, Slot is embracing it. ""We want to be there where we are now, we want to compete for everything,"" he said. ""Therefore you have to accept that if you work here or play here, that there's pressure."" Leverkusen may not be the force it was last season, having won just three of its last nine games in all competitions, but this was still a hugely impressive result for Slot's team. It was Leverkusen's heaviest loss in more than two years - since a 5-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in Alonso's third game in charge. ""It can happen that you come to Anfield and lose. To lose 4-0 is not nice. They are a top, top team and they punished us,"" Alonso said. There was the potential for a very different narrative on the night. One where Alonso - whose name was also sung by the home crowd - made a triumphant return and showed Liverpool what they might have had if he'd been the one to succeed Klopp. And even in defeat, his reputation remains high after leading Leverkusen to its first German title and ending Bayern's 11-year reign as champion. Only a loss to Atalanta in the final of the Europa League prevented him from completing a trophy treble. Little wonder he has been talked of as a future manager of Europe's grandest clubs, including Real Madrid. But Liverpool looks to be in good hands with Slot, whose rise has been more understated. Despite winning the Dutch league with Feyenoord, he was not an obvious choice to step into Klopp's shoes. He doesn't exude the same charisma as the German on the sidelines. He doesn't fire up the crowd or the players with the type chest thumping that Klopp was famed for. Yet he has quietly taken to the job with impressive ease and his team is doing its talking on the field. A record of eight wins from 10 in the Premier League has Liverpool leading the way ahead of four-time defending champion Manchester City. A 100% start in the Champions League now leaves the rest of Europe's top clubs in Liverpool's wake - City and reigning champion Real Madrid included. ""Things have gone so well with the new manager, it wasn't easy for him to come in and fill Jurgen Klopp's shoes,"" Diaz said. ""Hopefully, we'll have something to show for it at the end of the season.""","the, league, klopp, champions, jurgen, german, liverpool, slot, clubs, leverkusen, season, reign, shoes, alonso, name, his, manager, champion, bayer, coach"

The Merseyside club's record-equaling 20th English league title matched the achievement of its great rival Manchester United. Liverpool fans partied inside and outside its famous Anfield Stadium as coach Arne Slot sealed a remarkable first year in charge of the club. After going behind to an early goal from Dominic Solanke, Liverpool powered back with strikes from Luis Diaz, Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gapko before halftime to ensure the celebrations wouldn't be delayed any more. The title was sealed in style after the break as Mohamed Salah added another and Destiny Udogie's own-goal rounded off the rout. Liverpool only needed a point to be confirmed champion and a packed Anfield expected nothing less than to see the job get done on home turf. In the end, the victory was so comfortable that Salah even had time to pose for selfie in front of the famed Kop stand after scoring his goal.","anfield, league, arne, slot, 20th, title, goal, gapko, udogie, kop, destiny, liverpool, rout, equaling, manchester, alexis, allister, premier, diaz, solanke"

The Portugal international's second-half strike sealed a 1-0 win at Anfield and restored Liverpool's 12-point lead over Arsenal at the top of the standings. With just eight games remaining this season, this was one of the biggest hurdles standing in the way of a record-equalling 20th English title for Arne Slot's team. And it was Jota who came up with the decisive moment in the 57th minute when he twisted his way through the box and lashed a shot past Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. ""We are chasing down the best possible season we can have and Everton showed today again how difficult it is to win a football game in the Premier League,"" Slot said. ""We know that we're going to face eight very tough challenges, but as long as the players give as much as they did today and if (when) we play home games, the fans give us as much as they did today, we are in a very good position."" The race for the Champions League remains tight after Manchester City, Newcastle and Aston Villa all won. Test of nerve Liverpool's win could turn out to be a decisive moment in its charge toward the title after an outstanding campaign began to wobble in recent weeks. Champions League elimination at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain was quickly followed by defeat to Newcastle in the English League Cup final. Meanwhile, Arsenal's win over Fulham on Tuesday sparked the possibility that the Londoners could yet mount something of a title challenge after temporarily closing the gap at the top. Dropped points against a fast-improving Everton would only have fueled belief that the tension is beginning to hit Liverpool's players at just the wrong time and the home team had to survive two scares in the first half when Beto had a goal ruled out for offside and later struck the post after racing clear. But Liverpool's players held their nerve and took advantage through Jota's first goal in his last 11 games. Victory means Liverpool need just 13 more points to be confirmed champion. Reckless challenge Everton defender James Tarkowski escaped a red card for a dangerous high tackle on Liverpool's Alexis Mac Allister early in the match. Despite the Premier League describing the challenge, which left Mac Allister writhing in pain, as reckless, Tarkowski was only shown a yellow card by referee Samuel Barrott and avoided further punishment even after a VAR review. City protest Many City fans protested potential ticketing decisions by the club by sitting out the first nine minutes of the 2-0 win against Leicester. It meant they missed Jack Grealish's first league goal of the season - scored after just two minutes at the Etihad. Supporters are unhappy about the club's relationship with ticket resale companies, which they claim sell seats at inflated prices. Outside the stadium, fans held up a banner that read: ""MCFC - FOR THE LOVE NOT THE MONEY."" Fans were also urged not to buy food or merchandise from the ground. On the field, fourth-placed City stayed one point ahead of Newcastle in the race for Champions League qualification. Despite being without the injured Erling Haaland, City sealed victory through first-half goals from Grealish and Omar Marmoush. Newcastle, in fifth, beat Brentford 2-1. Rashford's revival Marcus Rashford 's resurgence at Aston Villa continued with his third goal in two games. Villa, which is into the quarterfinals of the Champions League and semifinals of the FA Cup, won 3-0 win at Brighton. Unai Emery's team is seventh - three points behind City and well in contention to secure a return to the Champions League next season. Rashford, meanwhile, is finding his form again after joining Villa on loan from Manchester United in January. His 51st-minute opener followed his double against Preston in the Cup on Sunday. Southampton denied Bottom-club Southampton came so close to securing only its third league win of the season. But those hopes were ended by Matheus Franca's goal in the second minute of stoppage time to salvage a 1-1 draw for Crystal Palace. Ipswich did pick up a rare win - beating Bournemouth 2-1 for its fourth of the campaign.","league, the, liverpool, win, everton, goal, rashford, allister, mac, challenge, tarkowski, franca, barrott, pickford, just, minute, premier, half, jota, grealish"

On the day Newcastle manager Eddie Howe returned to the dugout after recovering from pneumonia, his team's 3-0 win over Ipswich at St. James' Park was significant at both ends of the standings. Newcastle jumped into third place in the congested race to finish in the top five and secure a spot in next season's Champions League. Meanwhile, Ipswich's return to the Championship was confirmed, with the team partly owned by pop star Ed Sheeran joining Southampton and Leicester back in the second tier. It's the second straight season that the three promoted clubs have gone straight back down. ""It's been a massive challenge,"" said Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna, who led the team into the Premier League and back-to-back promotions from the third tier. ""Many things we have done positively that will set us up well for the years ahead (and) there's been some things we could have done better and things we will learn from."" Howe has already guided Newcastle to the English League Cup title this season for the club's first major trophy in 70 years. He said his team's remaining four league matches feel like cup finals, too. ""You're ticking down,"" he said. ""We have put ourselves back into a strong position but we know it can change quickly."" Chelsea climbed into fifth place, two points behind Newcastle and one behind Manchester City, by beating Everton 1-0 thanks to Nicolas Jackson's first-half goal. That sealed back-to-back wins for Chelsea. Just five points separate Newcastle and seventh-placed Aston Villa, which wasn't in action in the Premier League on Saturday. Instead, Villa was losing to Crystal Palace 3-0 at Wembley Stadium in the first FA Cup semifinal. Eberechi Eze and Ismaila Sarr (two) were the scorers for Palace, which reached the final for a third time in its bid for the first major trophy in the south London club's history. It lost to Manchester United on both previous occasions, in 1990 and 2016. Vardy's penalty woe Jamie Vardy began his long goodbye to Leicester, after confirming on Thursday he'd be leaving at the end of the season, by having a penalty saved in a 3-0 loss at Wolverhampton. ""That was so unfortunate,"" Leicester manager Ruud van Nistelrooy said. ""I really wanted him to score to get us back in the game but also for himself."" Brazil striker Matheus Cunha, linked heavily with a summer move to Manchester United, scored one and set up two in Wolves' sixth straight win that has seen the team power clear of relegation danger. ""It shows he is committed with us, with his teammates, with everyone,"" Wolves manager Vitor Pereira said of Cunha. Van Nistelrooy said he was unaware about his own future after falling to keep Leicester up. ""It is a matter of being patient and waiting,"" the Dutchman said. Stoppage-time winners for Fulham and Brighton Last-placed Southampton conceded in stoppage time to lose at home to Fulham 2-1 and stay on 11 points - tied for the lowest ever tally for a single season in the Premier League, set by Derby County in the 2007-08 season. Brighton scored in the 89th minute and again in stoppage time to secure a 3-2 win over West Ham, whose winless run extended to seven games under recently hired manager Graham Potter - formerly of Brighton. West Ham's Premier League status was guaranteed because of Ipswich's relegation but Potter accepted that being one place above the bottom three was not good enough. ""We have to acknowledge the season we are having is a bad one,"" he said. ""The fact we have stayed clear is good but not good enough.""","league, the, season, ipswich, manager, van, nistelrooy, cup, ham, mckenna, vitor, sheeran, graham, vardy, potter, pereira, kieran, howe, cunha, stoppage"

With just 10 points from 31 games, last-placed Southampton cannot finish above Wolverhampton Wanderers in 17th. Top of the table Liverpool lost 3-2 at Fulham, but remains 11 points clear of second-placed Arsenal, which drew 1-1 with Everton on Saturday. Brentford and Chelsea drew 0-0. Southampton's relegation is the joint fourth earliest in the Premier League era, according to Premier League statistician Opta. Derby's drop on March 29 in 2008 is still the earliest relegation since the league began in 1992. Huddersfield and Fulham suffered earlier relegations than Southampton, which is now joint with Leicester in 2002. Two first half goals from Brennan Johnson at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium put Southampton on course for its 25th league defeat of the campaign. Mateus Fernandes pulled one back late on for the visitors before Mathys Tel struck a third for Spurs from the penalty spot in added time. Liverpool slips up Liverpool failed to take advantage of Arsenal dropping points a day earlier, but still remains on course to win a record-equalling 20th English league title. Defeat at Craven Cottage was only its second in the league all season and came despite Alexis Mac Allister opening the scoring in the 14th minute. Goals from Ryan Sessegnon, Alex Iwobi and Rodrigo Muniz saw Fulham lead 3-1 at halftime. Luis Diaz got Liverpool's second after the break. Arne Slot's team needs 11 points from the remaining seven games to be crowned champion.","league, premier, defeat, arne, southampton, slot, relegation, sessegnon, statistician, relegations, iwobi, wanderers, hotspur, points, the, craven, cottage, brennan, mateus, dropping"

By the end of the day, Delhi was the last unbeaten team after Punjab Kings fell to Rajasthan Royals by 50 runs. Rahul's 77 off 51 balls, his maiden fifty for his new franchise, included six fours and three sixes, as Delhi notched 183-6. In reply, Chennai was restricted to 158-5 as its top order floundered. The only previous time Delhi started an IPL with three straight wins was in 2009. Meanwhile, Punjab suffered a fifth loss in six games at its new home in Mullanpur. Rajasthan powered to 205-4 as Yashasvi Jaiswal regained form to score 67 off 45 balls. Riyan Parag added 43 not out off 25. Punjab could manage only 155-9 from 43-4 in 6.2 overs. Jofra Archer took two wickets in the first over and Rajasthan earned a second win in four games. Chennai's power-hitting woes In Chennai, opting to bat, Delhi lost attacking opener Jake Fraser-McGurk for a five-ball duck. His wicket was taken by Khaleel Ahmed, Chennai's best bowler with 2-25 in four overs. Abishek Porel joined Rahul and shared 54 off 36 balls. Porel hit four fours and a six in 33 off 20 before he was out caught off Ravindra Jadeja. Skipper Axar Patel's cameo of 21 off 14 helped Delhi get to 90-3 just past the halfway stage. Rahul reached 50 off 33 deliveries and received middle-order help from Sameer Rizvi (20) and Tristan Stubbs (24 not out off 12 balls). Chennai stalled before it could start. Rachin Ravindra was out for 3, Devon Conway was caught for 13 and skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad removed for 5. Chennai was all but out at 41-3 in 5.3 overs. Impact substitute Shivam Dube struggled with 18 off 15 balls and Jadeja was out lbw for 2. Vijay Shankar scored 69 not out off 54 balls, including five fours and a six, but the run-rate required was overwhelming. He and Mahendra Singh Dhoni shared 84 off 57 but the chase was never really realistic. Jaiswal finds form for Rajasthan Jaiswal's previous best this season was 29 but he struck it rich in Mullanpur with five sixes and three boundaries to score 50 off 40 balls. A fully fit Sanju Samson added 38, and the duo opened with 89 off 62 balls. Lockie Ferguson got rid of both openers but Parag and Shimron Hetmyer combined for 47 off 25 balls. Parag hit three sixes and three fours in his unbeaten knock to power Rajasthan past 200. When Punjab batted, Archer bowled Priyansh Arya first ball and bowled in-form skipper Shreyas Iyer for 10. Marcus Stoinis (1) and Prabhsimran Singh (17) also fell cheaply and Punjab was in deep trouble. Nehal Wadhera turned the game around with Glenn Maxwell by putting on 88 off 52 balls. But then both batters fell to consecutive balls from Sri Lanka spinners and Punjab was sunk. Maxwell, 30 off 21, was caught off Matheesha Theekshana, and Wadhera, 62 off 41, was caught off Wanindu Hasranga. Change in Sunday fixtures Sunday's doubleheader was reduced to a single game, with Sunrisers Hyderabad taking on Gujarat Titans at home. Kolkata Knight Riders was supposed to host Lucknow SuperGiants but it was shifted to Tuesday after a request from Kolkata police due to religious festivities in the city. Tuesday will become a doubleheader: Punjab will host Chennai in the evening after the Kolkata-Lucknow game.","balls, chennai, kings, kolkata, fours, rahul, priyansh, doubleheader, fixtures, arya, ruturaj, gaikwad, off, samson, sanju, rajasthan, dube, mcgurk, fraser, skipper"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/lucknow-hands-mumbai-third-defeat-in-indian-premier-league,Lucknow hands Mumbai third defeat in Indian Premier League,Associated Press,2025-04-06 22:25:57,"LUCKNOW, APRIL 6 Lucknow Super Giants notched their first home win after beating the Mumbai Indians by 12 runs in the Indian Premier League on Friday. Fast bowlers Shardul Thakur and Avesh Khan kept their nerves in the last two overs against Hardik Pandya to restrict Mumbai to 191-5 in reply to Lucknow's 203-8. Thakur gave away only seven runs in the penultimate over and Khan conceded just nine runs in the final over despite Pandya smashing a first-ball six over extra cover. Mumbai seemed to be in control of the chase as Suryakumar Yadav made 67 off 43 balls in his 100th IPL game for the Indians. But Khan dismissed Yadav off a mistimed ramp shot in the 17th over that brought Lucknow back into the game. ""Mentally tough game,"" Lucknow captain Rishabh Pant said. ""They did not lose a lot of wickets and kept on going but we kept our calm and finished the game."" Lucknow has two wins and two losses. Five-time champion Mumbai has lost three of its four games. Lucky Marsh and Markram anchor Lucknow Mumbai suffered a setback when Rohit Sharma was ruled out of the game after injuring his knee in practice. Marsh capitalized on an early dropped chance and dominated a 69-run power play with Markram taking a back seat in the absence of Sharma. Marsh made 60 off 31 in a 76-run partnership with Markram. Marsh was dismissed by left-arm wrist spinner Vignesh Puthur, who took a smart diving return catch off a leading edge from the Australian, who hit his third half-century in four games. Pandya then dismissed Nicholas Pooran and Pant cheaply with two slower short balls. Pant, who was bought for an IPL-record $3.2 million by Lucknow, is going through a lean patch after his third single-digit score in four games. Markram briefly took on the attack but then played second fiddle to Ayub Badoni, who made a brisk 30 off 19 balls. However, Badoni departed before the death overs when he scooped a simple catch to wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton of Ashwani Kumar's off-cutter. Markram completed his half-century off 34 balls but fell for 53 off 38 to Pandya, who bowled two overs late in the innings and chipped in with three wickets to complete a five-wicket haul. Miller's two boundaries in the final over got Lucknow past 200, which proved just enough for the home team in the end. ""When you get a good start, you are always ahead of the game,"" Pant said. ""The idea is to play according to the situation. The start Marsh gave helped the lower middle capitalize on that."" Mumbai lose way after losing Yadav Yadav and Naman Dhir scored well over 10 per over after openers Will Jacks and Ryan Rickelton were out inside the first three overs of their run chase. Dhir hit three sixes and four boundaries in his 46 off 24 balls before he was clean-bowled by Digvesh Rathi's quick leg-break in the ninth over. Yadav and impact player Tilak Varma added 66 runs, but Lucknow came back when Yadav tried his favorite ramp shot behind the wicket but didn't time it well enough. Varma struggled to keep up the momentum and at 25 off 23 he was retired out with Mumbai still needing 24 off the final seven balls. ""Disappointing when you lose,"" Pandya said. ""It is a long tournament.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/liverpool-marching-toward-premier-league-title-after-statement-win-at-man-city,Liverpool marching toward Premier League title after statement win at Man City,Associated Press,2025-02-24 21:13:41,"MANCHESTER, FEBRUARY 24 Can anyone stop Liverpool's march toward the Premier League title? Not Manchester City, that's for sure. With a 2-0 win at the home of the four-time defending champion on Sunday, Liverpool produced a statement performance to move 11 points clear of Arsenal at the top of the standings. ""Special"" was how Mohamed Salah described the latest victory that left the away fans chanting ""We're gonna win the league"" after the final whistle. City manager Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, accepted the title was now Liverpool's to lose. First-half goals from Salah and Dominik Szoboszlai put Arne Slot's team on course for a win that leaves it in command of the title race after 27 games. Liverpool is now 20 points above fourth-placed City after completing a league double over Guardiola's once all-conquering team. While Slot tried to dampen title talk with months still remaining of the campaign, Liverpool's advantage is undeniable. ""What we do know is that no one saw us as a title contender when we started in the beginning of the season. And I think no one in the world of football would have expected City not to be so close to the one that leads the league,"" the Dutch coach said. This was City's eighth defeat in the league this season and 14th overall. The most games City had lost under Guardiola in any of his previous eight seasons was 12 in the 2019-20 campaign, which was the last time it failed to win the title. Then, as now, it was Liverpool that led the way, and the Merseyside club looks likely to win a record-equaling 20th league title this year. City, meanwhile, faces a fight to secure a top-four finish and a return to next season's Champions League. It is above fifth-placed Newcastle on goal difference and just two points ahead of Aston Villa in eighth. Title charge Arsenal's surprise 1-0 loss to West Ham on Saturday had given Liverpool the opportunity to strengthen its grip on the title race. And the visitors quickly took control at the Etihad through Salah's deflected effort from a well-worked corner routine in the 14th minute. It was his 30th goal of an outstanding campaign. He turned provider in the 37th to set up Szoboszlai, whose low shot wrong-footed City goalkeeper Ederson and rolled into the bottom corner. City, without the injured Erling Haaland, rarely looked like getting back into the match, with Omar Marmoush's disallowed goal for offside the closest the home team came to scoring. ""Now you're gonna believe us,"" chanted Liverpool's fans. ""The fans can sing whatever they want. I think they sing it quite long (time) already, but we know as a team how hard we have to work for every single win,"" Slot said. City slump Another humbling defeat in an ever-worsening season for City. On Wednesday a 3-1 loss to Real Madrid sent Guardiola's team crashing out of the Champions League. Back to domestic matters on Sunday and City was powerless to slow down Liverpool's title charge. The FA Cup is now the only realistic trophy available to City this season, while Champions League qualification is the priority for a team that has dominated English soccer under Guardiola. ""If it doesn't happen it's because we were not good enough, not because a lack of hunger and desire,"" Guardiola said. ""It is so tight with four or five teams and Nottingham, Newcastle, Aston Villa are so good. It will not be easy but we will try."" City went into this season having won an unprecedented four English league titles in a row. Under Guardiola it has won six of the last seven. In total, he has won 15 major trophies at the club, including the Champions League as part of a treble in 2023. Seven-goal thriller Newcastle scored four goals in 11 minutes against Nottingham Forest, but still had to withstand a late fightback to seal a 4-3 win. A first-half goal spree - including two more for Alexander Isak -- gave Newcastle a 4-1 lead at the break at St James' Park. But Forest, which had led after six minutes, mounted a comeback that provided a nervous finale. The win moved Newcastle up to fifth and boosted its hopes of a top-four finish and Champions League qualification. Third-placed Forest led through Callum Hudson-Odoi's opener in the sixth. But Newcastle powered back with Lewis Miley's goal in the 23rd sparking a remarkable spree. Jacob Murphy put the home team ahead two minutes later and Isak struck from the penalty spot in the 33rd. A minute later Isak scored his second to take his total for the season to 21. The Sweden striker is level with Erling Haaland on 19 league goals and only Mohamed Salah, with 24, has scored more this season. Forest's fightback began in the 63rd through Nikola Milenkovic and in the 90th, Ryan Yates pulled the score back to 4-3. The defeat was Forest's third in its last four games in the league and saw it miss out on the chance to move to within three points of second-placed Arsenal.","league, the, title, season, goal, guardiola, city, champions, liverpool, four, salah, placed, miley, forest, manchester, odoi, win, callum, marmoush, hudson"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/man-city-thrashed-5-1-by-arsenal-and-man-united-loses-at-home-again-in-premier-league,Man City thrashed 5-1 by Arsenal and Man United loses at home again in Premier League,Associated Press,2025-02-03 21:59:37,"LONDON, FEBRUARY 3 After a recent uplift in their results, the pain returned for Manchester City and Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday. City conceded a goal inside two minutes and was overwhelmed in the second half in a 5-1 loss at Arsenal, which trimmed the gap to leader Liverpool to six points. United lost again at home, 2-0 to Crystal Palace, and now has seven defeats in 13 league games at Old Trafford this season - something not seen since the 1890s. The chances of City winning a fifth straight Premier League title are surely over - the champions are 15 points behind Liverpool with 14 matches remaining - and they must have felt humiliated by the end of the game at Emirates that again demonstrated the new-found hostility between Arsenal and City. City arrived having won six of its last eight games in all competitions but all is still not right with Pep Guardiola's team, which let in a sloppy opener when Manuel Akanji was dispossessed near his own area and Martin Odegaard scored. Haaland was goaded after that goal by Gabriel in a hangover from the spiky 2-2 draw between the teams in September but responded by equalizing in the 55th. Arsenal went back in front in the 57th through Thomas Partey's deflected shot and there were further goals from Myles Lewis-Skelly, Kai Havertz and Ethan Nwaneri as City fell apart in a similar fashion to the 4-2 loss at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last month. ""How we played in the last 30 minutes is not acceptable. It's not us,"" City defender John Stones said. ""I'm angry, upset."" Arsenal reveled in the win. Lewis-Skelly, an 18-year-old defender, marked his goal by sitting down, crossing his legs and delivering a ""Zen"" celebration - one often used by Haaland. And when the final whistle sounded, the home team played Kendrick Lamar's ""Humble"" loudly around the stadium - surely a nod to Haaland telling Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta to ""stay humble"" after the 2-2 draw in September. ""This is a thing that's been building up over a certain amount of time,"" Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice said. ""With the Etihad at the start of the season and everything that went on there, you do have that fire in your stomach."" Arsenal was alone in second place, three points above Nottingham Forest and nine above fourth-placed City. Martinez sustains 'serious' injury in United loss On the day locally born striker Marcus Rashford edged closer to a departure from Old Trafford, Manchester United lacked a cutting edge up front in the loss to Crystal Palace. And there was more bad news Sunday for United with a tearful Lisandro Martinez carried off on a stretcher with a left knee injury – the latest injury to afflict the Argentina defender. Jean-Philippe Mateta scored both goals in the second half for Palace to end United's three-match winning run in all competitions - a streak coming after manager Ruben Amorim had called his team ""the worst team, maybe, in the history of Manchester United."" The Amorim era looks set to be without Rashford, at least until the end of the season, with the forward reportedly undergoing a medical examination at Aston Villa ahead of sealing a loan move with a view to a permanent transfer. Even with striker Rashford absent, Amorim fielded a team with no out-and-out striker and failed to create many good chances against Palace, which picked off United on the counterattack. Mateta's goals came in the 64th and 89th minutes. United has lost seven of its first 13 home games in the Premier League this season and that hasn't happened since the 1893-94 season, according to the competition's statistic supplier, Opta. Five of those defeats have come in the last six home matches under Amorim. ""It is difficult to play here because we want to please our fans,"" Amorim said. ""This season is going to be like that, I said it since the first day."" Relief for Postecoglou as Tottenham wins United dropped to 13th in the standings and was just one place and two points ahead of Tottenham, which won 2-0 at Brentford to end a four-match losing run in the league and ease some pressure on manager Ange Postecoglou. Vitaly Janelt scored an own-goal at a corner to put Tottenham ahead at halftime and Pape Sarr added the second goal in the 87th. ""We needed a big effort again today, a physical effort. We put that in,"" said Postecoglou, who rested defender Micky van de Ven after the defender returned from injury in the midweek win over Elfsborg in the Europa League. ""Outstanding effort by the players."" The result was a huge boost for Tottenham ahead of arguably the team's biggest match of the season, the second leg of the English League Cup semifinals against Liverpool on Thursday. Tottenham leads 1-0 from the first leg.","the, league, defender, season, amorim, goal, arsenal, skelly, micky, partey, ven, lisandro, team, premier, rashford, mateta, city, postecoglou, ange, martinez"

PSG also wins and stays in,Associated Press,2025-01-30 21:09:23,"GENEVA, JANUARY 30 Manchester City stayed in the Champions League, barely. Paris Saint-Germain saved its elite status in style. Both had risked embarrassing exits before winning on Wednesday, grateful to be among the 24 teams in the knockout stage. In the new playoffs-round draw Friday, they will also find defending champion Real Madrid or Bayern Munich who finished in mid-table after the 36-team standings was finalized. City flirted with a disaster before rallying to beat Club Brugge 3-1 in a must-win game. Trailing 1-0 at halftime, and then sitting 26th in the live standings, the 2023 title-winner was sparked by substitute Savinho to avoid elimination. ""In the second half we let our souls and hearts free,"" said City manager Pep Guardiola, who had an anguished evening on the sidelines and was shown a yellow card. City finished 22nd but relief turns to the realization that its playoff round opponent will be either Madrid or Bayern, which slotted into the bracket possibilities in, respectively, 11th and 12th place. PSG started play in 22nd before cruising to a 4-1 win at Stuttgart, fired by Ousmane Dembélé's hat trick, that eliminated the German club. The French champion impressed again after a crucial 4-2 comeback win over Man City one week ago, and rose to 15th place. Still, that puts PSG on a path to meet either Liverpool or Barcelona in the round of 16 in March if it wins an all-French playoff against either Monaco or Brest. Liverpool topped the standings despite a 3-2 loss with a weakened team at PSV Eindhoven, and Barcelona ended runner-up after a 2-2 draw with Atalanta. Only the top eight teams go direct to the round of 16 and that excludes Madrid, which won 3-0 at Brest, and Bayern, a 3-1 winner against Slovan Bratislava. Inter Milan, Arsenal and Atletico Madrid sealed top-eight finishes as expected with low-key wins. Inter beat Monaco 3-0, Arsenal won 2-1 at Girona and Atletico won 4-1 at Salzburg, which had a woeful campaign. Bayer Leverkusen, Lille - which thrashed Feyenoord 6-1 - and Aston Villa completed the top eight. Stuttgart dropped to 26th place and was eliminated along with Dinamo Zagreb, despite its 2-1 win over AC Milan whose United States playmaker Christian Pulisic had leveled the game. Milan can face Juventus in the playoffs round. Brugge took the 24th qualification place ahead of Dinamo on the tiebreaker of goal difference. An unprecedented Champions League night of 18 games playing at the same time - completing the new 144-game opening phase format – ended with no shock exits though final standings that defied expectations. Three English teams finished in the top eight but not Man City. Two Spanish teams finished in the top eight but not Real Madrid. The one German team in the top eight is not Bayern, and the one French team is not PSG. Those four wealthy powers of European soccer found the new eight-game format trickier than expected. They now have the burden of two extra games on back-to-back midweeks in February to earn round of 16 places that were routine in the old group-stage format. Villa joined Liverpool and Arsenal in the top eight by beating Celtic 4-2 to rise to 16 points - the cut that meant avoiding the playoffs. UEFA's preseason prediction of eight points to enter the knockout phase proved far off the mark. Dinamo got 11 points and still was eliminated, ensuring no team from eastern Europe will be in the knockout phase. The lowest-ranked country in Friday's playoffs round draw is Scotland, whose champion Celtic finished 21st, one place and one point above Man City.","the, standings, eight, madrid, playoffs, pulisic, club, teams, format, ousmane, dembélé, french, monaco, team, christian, celtic, win, brugge, game, round"

Real Madrid routs Salzburg to advance,Associated Press,2025-01-23 22:06:14,"LONDON, JANUARY 23 Manchester City is on the brink of a humiliating Champions League exit after a stunning loss to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, and Real Madrid is no longer at risk after routing Salzburg. Man City blew a two-goal lead in a high-stakes clash of super-wealthy underachievers that PSG won 4-2 in Paris yet still could be eliminated alongside the English champion after the final round of games next week. Only the top 24 in the 36-team standings will advance and Man City, the 2023 champion, will kick off in 25th place but will squeeze into the knockout playoffs round by beating Club Brugge. ""We will do everything there and if we don't do it we don't deserve it,"" manager Pep Guardiola said of the game in Manchester in one week's time. Brugge needs just a draw to advance. PSG rose to 22nd place to set up another tense challenge, at 24th-place Stuttgart which likely needs to win. Early in the second half in Paris, it was Man City looking set to send PSG close to elimination by taking a two-goal lead. Jack Grealish, a halftime substitute, scored in the 50th minute then his pass across the goalmouth was deflected toward Erling Haaland for a second four minutes later. Within six remarkable minutes PSG was level, from goals by Ousmane Dembélé and Bradley Barcola, and a stunning turnaround was completed in the 78th when Joao Neves headed the decisive goal. Gonçalo Ramos added a fourth in stoppage time. Madrid advances to knockout phase After winning a record 15th European title last season, then signing France star Kylian Mbappé in the offseason, it probably should not have been such a drama for Real Madrid to reach the knockout stages in the new Champions League format. But three losses in six games - to Lille, AC Milan and Liverpool - left Madrid in 22nd place at kickoff Wednesday, before swatting aside Salzburg 5-1 to rise into 16th. Brazil stars Rodrygo and Vinícius Júnior each scored twice, either side of a goal for Kylian Mbappé, in a mismatch ahead of the teams meeting again in the FIFA Club World Cup, in Philadelphia on June 26. Arsenal, Inter and Milan secure wins Arsenal and Inter got expected wins to rise to third and fourth, respectively, though not sure yet to join Liverpool and Barcelona among the top-eight teams advancing direct to the round of 16. Arsenal beat Dinamo Zagreb 3-0 and Inter won 1-0 at Sparta Prague that lifted both to 16 points, three clear of ninth-place Aston Villa. AC Milan quietly went about its business rising to sixth place with a 1-0 win against Girona at San Siro, on a powerful strike in the first half by Rafael Leão. Bayern slumps, risks tough path ahead Bayern Munich fell to a 3-0 defeat at Feyenoord and dropped to 15th in the mid-table morass of storied clubs - currently including Madrid and Juventus - who risk facing each other in the knockout playoff rounds in February. The teams that finish Nos. 15-18 in the standings next week will be drawn against each other in the playoffs - for the right to face Liverpool and, likely, Barcelona in the round of 16. Bayern is fortunate to have one of the easier-seeming final games, at home to Slovan Bratislava, which has lost seven straight. Celtic secured its place in the knockout rounds by winning 1-0 against last-place Young Boys, the other team to lose seven times. Leipzig ended its six-game losing run with a 2-1 win over Sporting Lisbon, though the champion of Portugal still is favored to advance. Shakhtar Donetsk stayed in contention - just - with a 2-0 win against Brest, which will be in the knockout phase. Final round All 36 teams will be in action at the same time next Wednesday in 18 games kicking off at the same time - 9 p.m. Central European Time (2000 GMT). The top eight in the final standings get a break until March, waiting for the round of 16. Teams that finish from ninth to 24th enter the knockout playoffs. Those two-leg pairings are drawn Jan. 31 at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.","knockout, the, place, teams, standings, champions, league, exit, round, champion, mbappé, boys, rounds, kylian, playoffs, time, pep, guardiola, goal, aston"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/india-against-south-africa-the-twenty20-world-cup-cricket-finale-features-two-unbeaten-teams,India against South Africa: The Twenty20 World Cup cricket finale features two unbeaten teams,Associated Press,2024-06-28 21:52:43,"NEW DELHI, JUNE 28 India is aiming to end its 11-year trophy drought in global cricket competitions. South Africa is chasing its first men's World Cup title in any limited-overs format. The Twenty20 World Cup finale at Bridgetown, Barbados on Saturday will feature the tournament's two unbeaten teams and it'll end in either triumph or heartbreak for opposing captains Rohit Sharma of India and Aiden Markram of South Africa. Sharma's India squad has calmly seen off opposing teams with dominant performances – with the bat and the ball -- on tricky pitches in the United States and the Caribbean, reaching its third T20 World Cup final by eliminating defending champion England in a lopsided semifinal. ""We've been very calm as a team,"" Sharma said. ""We do understand the occasion (in the final) but for us, it's important to keep calm and composed."" Markram's South African lineup didn't panic in tougher game scenarios in the group stage and in the Super Eight before finally skittling first-time semifinalist Afghanistan for just 56 runs to coast into the championship decider. ""It's a personal and individual motivation that you get to a final, to earn the opportunity to hopefully lift the trophy,"" said Markram, the first captain to steer a Proteas team into a World Cup final. ""But we all understand (as a team) this game and how it works and how things can go for you, things can go against you, and you take that in your stride."" Sharma emphasized calmness as the key to India's success, but wants to continue making the right decisions in the big moments. India showed plenty of depth in its squad and signaled it would be the team to beat when it successfully defended 119 against archrival Pakistan in the group stage on a difficult and much criticized drop-in pitch in New York. ""We need to make good decisions through the 40 overs,"" Sharma said. Yes, we do understand the occasion is important, but we need to play good cricket as well."" In a bowlers' tournament on variable wickets, Sharma's aggressive intent in the power plays has helped India put opposition teams on the backfoot early. His back-to-back half centuries in the last two games helped eliminate the past two champions – Australia and England – despite his opening partner Virat Kohli going through a lean patch and scoring just 75 runs in seven games. Kohli is yet to replicate Sharma's aggression and has been dismissed without scoring twice in his worst-ever appearance in six T20 World Cups. ""We understand his class and importance in big games. Form is never a player when you've played for 15 years,"" Sharma said. ""He's looking good, the intent is there, (and) probably he's saving himself for the final."" Sharma is the only remaining active player from the India lineup that won the inaugural T20 World Cup in South Africa in 2007. Sharma, Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja were part of the squad that went close to winning the title in 2014 in Bangladesh before losing to Sri Lanka in the final. Like Sharma, Markram has also led South Africa admirably throughout the tournament that started June 1, including nervy wins over Bangladesh and Nepal in the group stage. Pace bowlers Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada posed constant threats and are likely to challenge the aggression of Sharma. Spinners Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj are capable of exploiting the perfect bowling conditions. Quinton de Kock, with 204 runs in South Africa's eight consecutive wins, is the only Proteas batter with 200-plus runs in the tournament. David Miller's 148 is the next highest tally in a series of games dominated by the bowlers. Rabada and Nortje have combined for 25 wickets in the tournament, while Maharaj and Shamsi have 20 wickets between them. Markram is conscious that South Africa has never got this far in any major tournament - slipping in the semifinals seven previous times in the T20 or 50-over formats - but also aware of the strengths those past stars have helped create. ""They were guys that are legends of the game, legends of South African cricket,"" he said. ""In my eyes, it doesn't matter if they made a final or not, because they inspired all of us to play cricket for South Africa. ""Because of them, we're trying to represent those people that have played before us, so we're glad we've made them proud, (and) to an extent I still feel we've got one more step left.""","the, cup, world, t20, south, tabraiz, shamsi, twenty20, teams, squad, cricket, nortje, anrich, runs, markram, bowlers, sharma, proteas, intent, aggression"

Captain Rohit Sharma bludgeoned 92 off 41 balls to lead India to a 24-run win over Australia in St. Lucia. Afghanistan advanced when it beat Bangladesh by eight runs with seven balls remaining in a thrilling, rain-affected match at Kingstown, St. Vincent, to conclude the Super Eight stage. At times in the match the fate of the Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Australia teams all hung in the balance, with all three in semifinals contention depending on the result. But it was finally Afghanistan that went through to a semifinal Wednesday against South Africa. Unbeaten India will play defending champion England on Thursday. Sharma posted this tournament's fastest half-century - off 19 deliveries - and finished with eight sixes and seven boundaries as India plundered 205-5. Travis Head kept Australia in the chase with a blistering 76 off 43 balls, but his teammates choked against spinners Kuldeep Yadav (2-24) and Axar Patel (1-21) to be restricted at 181-7. ""It's quite satisfying, especially when you play like that,"" Sharma said. ""We don't want to do anything different (in the semifinals), we want to play the same way, understand what the individuals need to do in a given situation, and play freely."" Sharma set the tone when he smashed Mitchell Starc's second over for 29 runs, including three sixes. Virat Kohli was out for his second duck in the tournament, caught at midwicket off a Josh Hazlewood short ball. Kohli has just 66 runs in six games but fellow veteran Sharma was held back only by a five-minute rain delay. ""The 50s and 100s don't matter, I wanted to bat with the same tempo and carry on,"" Sharma said. ""You want to make the bowlers think where the next shot is coming, and I think I managed to do that."" In total, 76 of his runs came from boundaries and sixes. He became the first batter to hit 200 sixes in T20 internationals, and he also passed Kohli (4,103) and Pakistan's Babar Azam (4,145) as the leading scorer in international cricket's shortest format. Sharma had the first century of this tournament in sight before he was undone by Starc's yorker in the 12th over. But middle-order batters Suryakumar Yadav (31), Shivam Dube (28) and Hardik Pandya (27) ensured India of the joint highest total against Australia in men's T20 World Cup history. Only Hazlewood (1-14) bowled at the right lengths in his four overs. Australia lost David Warner in Arshdeep Singh's (3-37) first over, but Head and captain Mitchell Marsh (37) counterpunched with a brisk 81-run, second-wicket stand. Patel's brilliant one-handed catch removed Marsh, and Yadav bowled Glenn Maxwell on 20 in the 14th over. After Head was deceived by Jasprit Bumrah's slower ball, Australia's challenge fizzled out. ""It's disappointing,"" Marsh said. ""India got the better of us ... we've seen for 15 years what Rohit Sharma can do in that kind of mood, and he got off to an absolute flier."" Afghanistan qualifies Afghanistan batted first and made what seemed an inadequate 115-5 in a match it had to win to reach the semifinals for the first time. Then in a dramatic second innings with rain hovering and three nations gripped by the action, Bangladesh fell short in a hectic effort to surpass Afghanistan's total in 12.1 overs - which would have sent it into the semifinals. Afghanistan's victory was finally sealed when the last Bangladesh wicket fell with the total 105 at 1:10 a.m. local time. Few dared leave the ground as they were gripped until the end by the action and the kaleidoscope of changing fortunes. Rain interrupted the match on four occasions, adding more drama and bringing revised targets into play. In an breath-taking finish to the Super Eight stage, there were four main scenarios. If Afghanistan won it would go through. If it rained and the match ended without a result, Afghanistan also would progress. A Bangladesh win would end Afghanistan's campaign and send Australia through. But if Bangladesh won within 12.1 overs it would go through on net run-rate and both Afghanistan and Australia would go home. When Afghanistan made only 115 after choosing to bat, all of those scenario's remained in play. Rain eventually reduced the chase to 114 from 19 overs. Naveen-ul-Haq dismissed Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman with the last two balls of the 18th over to clinch the match and finish with 4-26. Litton Das carried his bat and finished 54 not out for Bangladesh. ""We have worked so hard over the past few years and we were dreaming and we were waiting for this day,"" Naveen said. ""When that day comes and it happens, it's a surreal experience."" As he spoke, the Afghanistan players carried their captain Rashid Khan around the field as rain fell. ""It's a massive celebration back home. In this World Cup, I think the country will be very proud,"" Rashid said in a later TV interview. ""I'm so happy the way we've delivered as a team.""","the, afghanistan, cup, twenty20, eight, hazlewood, world, islet, gros, balls, semifinals, arshdeep, runs, super, sixes, azam, babar, starc, bangladesh, rain"

Rain meant the match at Broward County Stadium was abandoned without a ball bowled, advancing the Americans to the Super Eight stage and automatically qualifying them for the 2026 Twenty20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The U.S. qualified for this T20 World Cup only as a co-host with the West Indies, but it has used home advantage to make a stunning first impression in its first major cricket tournament. While the Americans progressed alongside unbeaten India from Group A, former champion Pakistan and winless Ireland were eliminated from Super Eight contention. Pakistan won the title in 2009 and reached two more finals, including at the last T20 World Cup in 2022. Pakistan has failed to get out of the group stage for the first time. Ireland was expected to be a threat, too. The Irish also reached the second round on debut in 2009 and repeated in 2022. The competition point from the washout was enough for the U.S. to advance after beating Canada in Texas and stunning Pakistan on Long Island in the first week. Tying Pakistan in regular overs then beating it in a super over was one of the greatest upsets in the tournament's history. The Americans were thumped by India, one of the title favorites, as expected on Wednesday but the hosts' progression without being able to play on Friday was still well deserved. The umpires made four inspections of the wet outfield before heavy rain arrived at around 1:30 p.m. local time and the match was called off three hours after its scheduled start. The 17th-ranked U.S. joined the West Indies, India, Australia, South Africa and Afghanistan in the Super Eight, with two more teams yet to qualify. The Super Eight starting on Wednesday splits into two groups, with each team guaranteed three games to try and reach the semifinals. Later Friday, South Africa was playing Nepal in St. Vincent, and New Zealand was meeting Uganda in Trinidad.","super, cup, the, twenty20, world, eight, t20, group, americans, pakistan, cricket, washout, inspections, debut, indies, progression, broward, irish, upsets, round"

Suryakumar Yadav's half-century powered India to a seven-wicket win over the U.S., which had shocked Pakistan last week. With the win, India reached the Super 8 round. The U.S. can advance by beating Ireland on Friday. In a later match at Brian Lara Stadium in Trinidad, Sherfane Rutherford scored an unbeaten 68 from 39 deliveries to help the West Indies in their great escape - the co-hosts beat New Zealand by 13 runs. The Caribbean lineup, 149-9 in its 20 overs, was 76-7 before its Rutherford-led recovery. Alzarri Joseph snared four New Zealand wickets and Gudakesh Motie took three - including New Zealand captain Kane Williamson for 1 - to restrict the Black Caps to 136-9 in reply. On Long Island, Yadvav's 50 runs came off 49 balls and included two boundaries and two sixes. He put on 72 runs off 65 balls in an unbeaten fourth-wicket stand with Shivam Dube, who scored 31 not out as India finished with 111-3 in 18.2 overs in reply to 110-8 by the United States. Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh returned figures of 4-9 - including two wickets in the first over - to restrict the co-hosts after India had won the toss and opted to field at the Nassau County International Stadium. India was in early trouble in its chase as Indian-born medium pacer Saurabh Netravalkar continued his golden run for the Americans. After bowling the co-hosts to the upset over Pakistan, he celebrated the wickets of Indian superstars Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. Kohli was caught behind for a golden duck - dismissed off the first delivery he faced - in what surely will become a career highlight for Netravalkar. Sharma (3) fell to a slower delivery as Netravalkar finished with 2-18 in four overs. Rishabh Pant scored 18 off 20 balls batting at No. 3 before he was bowled by Ali Khan delivery. With India struggling at 39-3 in 7.3 overs, the U.S. team momentarily raised visions of an even bigger shock. West Indies advance Left-hander Rutherford turned the home team's fortunes around, going to the crease with the West Indies reeling at 22-4 after 5.4 overs. Rutherford scored 18 off the last over that culminated with a six and a boundary. The loss left New Zealand with a strong possibility it will not make the second round. If Afghanistan beats Papua New Guinea on Thursday, three-time runner-up New Zealand will be out of contention. For most of the first half of the game, the Black Caps were on top. But Rutherford went on the attack as the West Indies added 58-2 in the last five overs of their innings. He was 15 off 14 deliveries when star allrounder Andre Russell was out for 14 in the 13th over, and he accelerated with the lower-order in a counter-attacking, 72-minute innings containing six sixes and two boundaries. ""It's a good feeling, to help my team. That is what we live for and work hard for,"" man-of-the-match Rutherford said during the innings break. ""It was a very tough surface to start on. I think 149 is a brilliant score on this wicket."" After the match, Rutherford had a more optimistic tone: ""It is only the start of something big to come and hopefully we can keep winning and momentum going."" New Zealand started well after winning the toss and fielding, with Trent Boult (3-16) bowling opener Johnson Charles to end the first over. Tim Southee (2-21), recalled after missing New Zealand's opening loss to Afghanistan, dismissed dangerman Nicholas Pooran for 12 in the fourth over, trigging a run of three wickets for three runs. Lockie Ferguson deceived Roston Chase with a slower ball to make it 21-3 and skipper Rovman Powell (1) was caught behind off Southee five balls later. Russell went on the attack but his dismissal - caught in the deep of Boult's bowling - appeared to be an insurmountable setback until Rutherford took up the challenge. ""The quality of Sherfane's innings was high,"" New Zealand skipper Williamson said. ""The batting depth in their side was beneficial for sure. We cannot make excuses and have to find ways.""","zealand, the, overs, rutherford, new, williamson, rovman, sherfane, twenty20, innings, netravalkar, powell, pooran, russell, balls, chase, boult, andre, nicholas, saurabh"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/mystery-pitch-awaits-crestfallen-pakistan-in-twenty20-world-cup-cricket-match-against-india,Mystery pitch awaits crestfallen Pakistan in Twenty20 World Cup cricket match against India,Associated Pres,2024-06-08 11:01:43,"WESTBURY, JUNE 8 A crestfallen Pakistan goes into its grudge game against archrival India at cricket's Twenty20 World Cup on Sunday with still-painful memories of its huge upset defeat by the United States. The U.S. beat Pakistan in Group A game with a historic win in the Super Over at Dallas on Thursday to register its second successive victory in its debut World Cup. Pakistan captain Babar Azam cannot afford another loss that might put his team's progress to the Super 8 playoff stage in serious danger. Nothing seems to have gone right for Pakistan since the Babar-led team lost the T20 World Cup final against England in 2022. Pakistan lost T20 internationals against Afghanistan, understrength New Zealand, Ireland and England before losing to the U.S in the shock upset on Thursday. The reaction back home in Pakistan was predictable. ""USA grounded Pakistan in their opening game,"" wrote former Pakistan fast bowler Waqar Younis on the social media site X. ""History's been registered. Pakistan looked exhausted and helpless in the field. Congrats USA for a thumping victory."" Fellow former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar added: ""Unfortunately Pakistan never deserved to win."" And the struggles for Pakistan might continue. A set of mystery drop-in pitches that has a variable bounce at the purpose-built 34,000-capacity stadium on Long Island in Westbury, New York awaits Babar's struggling batters against the likes of Indian fast bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Muhammed Siraj. Former Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower criticized the pitches in New York, saying they were bordering on dangerous. ""I've got to say that is not a good surface to play an international match on,"" Flower said, ""It's bordering on dangerous. You saw the ball bouncing from a length both ways, skidding low occasionally ... and striking people on the thumb, on the gloves, on the helmet and making life very very difficult for any batsman."" Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar said there's something not quite right with the preparation of the pitches. ""Either the pitch has been under-prepared or something that is beyond their control,"" he said. ""I'm sure it's not a lack of effort. At the most what they can do is keep rolling that drop-in pitch. But they have a problem on their hands. Inherently there's something wrong with the pace of the surface."" Sri Lanka was bowled out for 77 by South Africa and India dismissed Ireland for 96 in its opening group game. Babar has reunited with his tried and tested opening partner Mohammad Rizwan but it's the middle-order that has not given any sort of momentum for Pakistan, except for Fakhar Zaman. The pace quartet is off-color too and failed to provide early breakthroughs. And Haris Rauf conceded 15 off the last over against U.S. during the regulation game and Mohammad Amir, who ended his retirement to play in the World Cup, bowled a costly 18-run Super Over against the U.S. India looks like a more settled side with the experience of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli up front and have an added advantage of experiencing the conditions in New York. They played a warm-up game against Bangladesh and then thumped Ireland by seven wickets. The variable bounce might once against encourage Sharma to go with four fast bowlers against Pakistan, just like he did against Ireland, and also managed to squeeze in two spin all-rounders - Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja. ""Looking at the pitch and conditions, we are open to make changes and do what is required at that point,"" Sharma said after beating Ireland. ""When we picked the team, we wanted to have that balance.

Gurbaz and Ibrahim put on 154 in a 125-run win over Uganda in Afghanistan's opening match and made 103 for the first wicket in a total of 159-6 as Afghanistan batted first after New Zealand won the toss. Fazalhaq Farooqi and Rashid Khan both took 4-17 as New Zealand was bowled out for 75 in the 16th over, its fourth-lowest T20 total. Earlier Friday in Dallas, Nicholas Kirton scored 49 off 35 balls to help Canada earn its first win at a T20 World Cup by 12 runs over Ireland. In the third match Friday in New York, Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka by two wickets with six balls remaining in a tense match, consigning Sri Lanka to its second consecutive loss in Group D. Gurbaz and Ibrahim are only the third pair and first openers to post back-to-back century partnerships at a Twenty20 World Cup. They stayed together until the 15th over Friday when Ibrahim was out for 44 from 41 balls. Gurbaz finally was out in the 20th over, having made 80 from 56 balls with five fours and five sixes. The Afghanistan innings contained nine sixes and 10 fours. ""We were waiting for this match for the last three years,"" Gurbaz said. ""We played them at the World Cup three years ago and they beat us. Finally we beat them. We had the trust and belief in ourselves from the very start."" New Zealand came into the tournament as one of the favorites after reaching at least the semifinals at the last six white-ball World Cups - 50-over one-day internationals and Twenty20 matches. But it also came into its opening match with no local warm-up match and with most players having been inactive for some time. That showed in the field where their performance featured dropped catches, overthrows and misfields. ""Afghanistan outplayed us in all facets of the game,"" New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said. ""From our perspective it wasn't good enough in terms of starting a tournament. Very frustrating."" CANADA BEATS IRELAND Nicholas Kirton helped Canada score 137-7 in 20 overs after it was put into bat. Shreyas Movva also contributed 37 runs. In reply, Ireland was restricted to 125-7 with medium pacers Jeremy Gordon and Dillon Heyliger taking two wickets each. Canada is competing at the T20 World Cup for the first time, and lost its opening game to the United States. The U.S. followed that win with a huge upset victory Thursday over Pakistan. ""It was a good wicket to bat on, except a couple of patches in the middle,"" Kirton said. ""It was important to get set and bounce back from defeat in the first game."" Kirton hit three fours and two sixes, following on from the 51 he scored against the U.S. He put on 75 off 63 balls with Movva for the fifth wicket – a partnership that turned the game for Canada. BANGLADESH IN TIGHT WIN Bangladesh opened its campaign with its two-wicket win over Sri Lanka in a match which became much closer than it should have been. Sri Lanka posted 124-9 batting first but lost its last seven wickets for 54 runs in just over 11 overs. Opener Pathum Nissanka top-scored with 47 from 28 balls. Bangladesh seemed to be coasting to victory at 109-5 in the 17th over, needing 16 runs from 28 balls. Towhid Hridoy made 40 from 20 balls and Litton Das 30 from 38 to set Bangladesh up for what seemed likely to be an easy win. But wickets tumbled and the task became more treacherous. Maheesh Theekshana pulled off a brilliant catch at fine leg to dismiss Shakib Al Hasan and Nuwan Thusara took wickets with consecutive balls in the 18th over. The veteran Mahmudullah stayed calm amid the chaos to steer his team home, making 18 as Bangladesh chased 11 runs from the last two overs. Mahmudullah hit a six from the first ball of the 19th over and the winning run came from an overthrow.","balls, the, win, twenty20, cup, match, world, gurbaz, runs, wicket, its, t20, sixes, fours, consecutive, nissanka, pathum, first, litton, 125"

Anrich Nortje's career-best 4-7 set South Africa up for a six-wicket opening victory and Fazal Haq Farooqi's maiden five-wicket haul - he returned 5-9 - helped Afghanistan to a 125-run win over tournament newcomer Uganda. South Africa overcame its own hiccups on the two-paced pitch to reach 80-4 with 3.4 overs to spare at the purpose-built Nassau County Stadium on Long Island. South Africa's best bowling performance in tournament history also included pace bowler Kagiso Rabada's 2-21, spinner Keshav Maharaj's 2-22, and fast bowler Ottneil Baartman's 1-9 in his second T20. Opener Kusal Mendis top-scored for Sri Lanka with a 30-ball 19, one of only three scores in double figures. The Sri Lankans were dismissed in 19.1 overs. Skipper Wanindu Hasaranga took 2-22 but South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen remained calm to finish off proceedings for the Proteas with an unbeaten 19. ""We did well to restrict them to a low score,"" man-of-the-match Nortje said. ""It was an up-and-down wicket, so it was important to get early wickets. These drop-in pitches are tough to bowl on."" Tougher to bat on. Sri Lanka opted to bat first and misread the variable bounce. Baartman had Pathum Nissanka caught behind for 3. Nortje removed Kamindu Mendis, caught at square leg on 11. Hasaranga was surprisingly promoted to No. 4 but was stumped for a two-ball duck. Next ball, Maharaj bowled Sadeera Samarawickrama for a golden duck. Sri Lanka lost its last four wickets for nine runs across 27 deliveries. In hindsight, on a pitch that didn't allow for the usual big T20 hits, Sri Lanka would have been competitive with a total of 100. ""To be honest this was a 120-run wicket, especially with our bowlers,"" Hasaranga said. South Africa made a poor start in front of the crowd of 12,562, losing opener Reeza Hendricks (4) in the second over. Quinton de Kock scored 20 runs off 27 balls before Klaasen and David Miller combined for 22 off 21 balls. At only 4.2 runs per over, the match featured the lowest run-rate in a T20 World Cup. At Providence, Guyana, openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz (76) and Ibrahim Zadran (70) put on a 154-run opening stand that set Afghanistan on course for 183-4. Farooqi took two wickets on consecutive balls in the first over and narrowly missed another chance for a hat-trick as Uganda tumbled to the fourth-lowest total at a T20 World Cup. The contrast between the teams was starkly demonstrated with the second ball of each innings Gurbaz drove the second ball of the match for a six. Ronak Patel was bowled on the second ball of Uganda's reply by Farooqi. Uganda captain Brian Masaba had won the toss and decided to field in the hope that an early tournament trend would continue - chasing teams won the first four matches. That streak has ended. It took Masaba (2-21) until the 15th over to take Uganda's first wicket at a T20 World Cup, dismissing Zadran to break Afghanistan's opening stand. ""First game of the World Cup, a lot of nerves - right now I feel it's good to get that out of the way,"" Masaba said. ""We will look to play better next game."" Gurbaz went with the addition of two to the total and then the run-rate as Afghanistan lost five wickets for 29 off the last 6 1/2 overs. Any chance that Uganda had was over in the first power play, with Farooqi taking his two wickets with consecutive perfectly pitched in-swinging deliveries in the first over and Naveen-ul-Haq (2-4) getting two wickets to have the African qualifiers reeling at 21-5 after six overs. Only two Ugandan batters reached double figures before Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan (2-12) finished off the innings with two wickets in the 16th over. Rashid said it was the kind of start Afghanistan needed, adding that World Cup experience in both the 50-over and T20 formats has given his team a lot of confidence. ""We played against the big teams and we have given them a tough time,"" Rashid said. ""That really gives us the kind of belief that we are capable of beating any side any time.""","cup, the, uganda, africa, haq, twenty20, world, wicket, t20, wickets, masaba, fazal, run, hendricks, reeza, south, klaasen, heinrich, farooqi, overs"

The hosts chased down the 162-run target just after lunch on the third day after it had earlier wrapped up India's second innings in quick time for 157 to win the series 3-1. Sunday's victory also means the hosts booked their spot in a second straight World Test Championship final where it will play the already-qualified South Africa at Lord's in June. ""This (Border-Gavaskar Trophy) was one that a few of us didn't have,"" said Australia captain Pat Cummins. ""It's been an amazing series and it's one of those ones that's been in the calendar for a fair while. ""You've always got an eye on it for the last year or two, and it's really lived up to all the hype."" In a devastating setback for India's hopes of bowling out Australia to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for a record-extending fifth consecutive time, star bowler and captain Jasprit Bumrah did not bowl during Australia's second innings. Bumrah's injury occurred on Saturday and had only been described as "" back spasms"" by the India team after the star seamer had returned from medical scans at a nearby clinic. Bumrah had back surgery to repair a stress fracture in April 2023. The 31-year-old, who was named man-of-the-series with his 32 wickets - the highest ever by an Indian bowler in a single series in Australia - has almost single handedly kept India in the contest throughout the summer. But he but did not warm up with the other bowlers prior to play Sunday and looked uncomfortable when he did come out to bat as India's was quickly swept up by the hosts. ""So you know, lots of ifs and buts because the whole series was well fought and today as well, you know, we were in the game, so it was not like it was totally one-sided,"" Bumrah said. ""This is how cricket goes in the nervy moments, whichever team holds their nerve for the longest and you know, sticks together and tries to find a way out of that, will win the series."" Even without its talisman, India's attack still sent jitters through Australia's batting as it had the hosts at 71-3 at lunch and then removed Usman Khawaja (41) to seed more doubt. Australia had taken 35 from the first three overs and it appeared they might wrap up the test and series before lunch. But with India desperately needed a breakthrough they got it when Konstas (22) played a wild swipe off Prasidh Krishna with Australia 39-1. Krishna (3-27) then added Labuschagne (6) to his tally and then the prize wicket of Steve Smith to send some jitters through Australia's batting lineup at 58-3. Smith managed only four of the five runs he needed to become the 15th player - and fourth Australian after Ricky Ponting, Steve Waugh and Allan Border - to pass 10,000 career test runs. But Travis Head (34 not out) - a frequent thorn in India's side in recent years - and debutant Beau Webster (39 not out) guided Australia home for a landmark series win under Cummins. Australia now holds every bilateral test trophy available as well as the one-day international World Cup won in India in 2023. ""Yeah, really proud with what we've been able to achieve,"" said Cummins, who took a team-leading 25 wickets. ""We're also hopefully having the best time of our lives as we're doing it together as well, so yeah, pretty satisfied at the moment."" Earlier Sunday, Cummins (3-44) and Scott Boland took two wickets each to wrap up India's innings for 157, with the tourists only able to add 16 runs to its overnight total to set Australia a target of 162 runs to win the test. Boland, named man-of-the-match, returned 6-45 for his second career five-wicket haul and took 10 wickets in a match for the first time. On Saturday, Rishabh Pant's blistering half century highlighted a chaotic second day where 15 wickets fell and India reached 141-6, for a 145-run lead to leave the series very much in the balance. Australia was earlier bowled out for 181, giving India a four-run lead on the first innings, and could not take advantage of Bumrah's absence. Australia's 3-1 series win came after victories in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. India won the first test at Perth and the 3rd test at Brisbane was a rain-affected draw.","test, the, gavaskar, trophy, series, wickets, bumrah, border, australia, sydney, india, webster, beau, innings, runs, 162, bowler, second, rishabh, star"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/head-and-smith-centuries-rally-australia-after-top-order-collapse-against-india-on-2nd-day-3rd-test,"Head and Smith centuries rally Australia after top order collapse against India on 2nd day, 3rd test",Associated Press,2024-12-15 20:03:49,"BRISBANE, DECEMBER 15 India's seamers triggered another top order batting collapse but a second successive century for Travis Head and a long overdue hundred for Steven Smith gave Australia the ascendancy after the second day of the third cricket test. At stumps, Australia was 405-7 after Head made a characteristic sparkling 152, while Smith completed a much more circumspect 101 in a 241-run partnership which rallied the hosts after they had been in a precarious position earlier Sunday. Jasprit Bumrah took 5-72 and again underlined his stature as the current top-ranked bowler in tests as he tormented Australia's top-order batters on a Gabba pitch that was offering plenty of assistance for bowlers under patchy cloud-covered skies early on Sunday. Australia resumed at 28 without loss after rain curtailed the opening day to just 13.2 overs, and it didn't take long for Bumrah to make his mark as, like the first innings in both opening two tests, the seamer's relentless accuracy and ability to move the ball off the pitch led to early breakthroughs. First, he removed Usman Khawaja caught behind for 21 with a ball that moved late on the veteran opener to have Australia at 31-1. Nathan McSweeney made a patient 9 runs off 49 balls but could do little more than to edge another sharp delivery from Bumrah to Virat Kohli at second slip as Australia slipped to 38-2 in the 19th over. It was the fourth time in the series that Bumrah has claimed McSweeney's wicket. Smith and Marnus Labuschagne steadily put Australia back on track but Nitish Kumar Reddy teased a wild swipe from Labuschagne (12) which was well caught by Kohli in the slips as India captain Rohit Sharma's decision to bowl first seemed to be paying off. Smith and Head came together with Australia at 75-3 but a combination of Head's attacking mindset and Smith's belligerence steered the hosts safely to lunch. After the break, Head raised an enterprising half century off 71 balls but accelerated as he got closer to three figures and completed his second consecutive hundred with a whip through mid-wicket off Mohammed Siraj. Head's ninth test century came off 115 balls with 13 fours and continues his rich vein of form against India that includes centuries in the World Test Championship final at Lords, the one-day World Cup final in India in 2023 and his match-turning 140 in his hometown of Adelaide in the second test last week. Smith, who has had a wretched run of outs over the past 12 months and has not made a century since the Ashes in mid-2023, played himself back into form here. His first fifty came off a watchful 128 balls in 210 minutes, but after the tea break Australia's best batter of a generation found some long-missing confidence and flow as he began to appear at ease against India's tiring bowling attack. The milestone ton duly came just after India had taken the second new ball to try and find a much-needed breakthrough. Smith moved from 95 to 99 with a sublime straight drive for his 11th boundary and next ball flicked Akash Deep to fine leg to complete his 33rd test hundred, but his first in 26 innings off 185 balls. Next over, Smith made his first mistake and was caught by Sharma at slip off Bumrah on 101 and walked off to a standing ovation from the 34,000 Gabba crowd. Mitch Marsh (5) edged through to Kohli for Bumrah's fourth wicket and three balls later Bumrah finally got Head also caught behind the wicket to complete his 12th five-wicket haul in tests. Head's 152 came from 160 balls with 18 fours and equaled his best innings at the Gabba. A flurry of hitting late in the day by Alex Carey (45 not out) and Pat Cummins (20) capped a dominant two sessions for the hosts as they passed 400. On the first day Saturday, rain first halted play for about 30 minutes in the sixth over. The showers returned about a half-hour later and washed out the remainder of the opening day. India won the first test by 295 runs at Perth, while Australia came back to win the second day-night test in Adelaide by 10 wickets.","the, balls, test, day, gabba, second, wicket, century, smith, mcsweeney, head, his, ball, siraj, first, collapse, innings, bumrah, mohammed, order"

In reply, Australia finished on 86-1 with Nathan McSweeney 38 not out and Marnus Labuschagne unbeaten on 20. India, which handed Australia a 295-run defeat in the first test of the five-match series, struggled after opting to bat first in the day-night match. Starc dismissed in-form opener Yashasvi Jaiswal lbw with the first delivery of the pink-ball test, and then returned to send back KL Rahul and Virat Kohli in the second hour of play. Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill were back in the side after missing the first test in Perth but Gill was trapped lbw by Scott Boland for 31 to make the score 81-4. Sharma, batting at No. 6, also went six runs later, again trapped lbw by Boland for three. Boland was back in the Australia side in place of the injured Josh Hazlewood. Pat Cummins took the sixth wicket to fall when he bounced out Rishabh Pant for 21. Ravichandran Ashwin made 22 before he was yorked by Starc, who then bowled Harshit Rana for a duck to celebrate his first five-wicket test haul against India. The No. 7 batter Nitish Reddy top-scored with 42 off 54 balls – hitting three sixes – before he was last man out, caught off Starc as the Australia paceman surpassed his previous test best of 6-50 against Sri Lanka. Post tea, Australia dominated with the bat and lost only one wicket. The Indian pacemen were wayward with the new ball, yet Jasprit Bumrah was able to dismiss Usman Khawaja for 13, caught at slip by Sharma.

Pat Cummins took 5-57 as he bounced out the Indian lower order, with the visitors crashing to 175 all out in its second innings for a slender 18-run lead. Usman Khawaja and Nathan McSweeney then guided Australia safely to a ten-wicket victory to ease the pressure that had been building since the hosts were humbled by 295 runs in the 1st test at Perth. ""This week we were back to our best,"" Cummins said. ""That's the team that I remember and how we want to play our cricket, so really satisfying. ""I think being one down, no doubt there's a little bit more on it trying to level up the series."" Resuming at 128-5 in the second innings, India needed a near-miracle from Rishabh Pant to have any hope of setting a testing fourth innings target for Australia to chase. But Mitchell Starc had other ideas, as he had Pant (28) caught at slip from the sixth delivery of the afternoon. Cummins then got into the act using the short ball tactic against the Indian lower order to great effect. Ravichandran Ashwin (7) was caught behind trying to pull, while Harshit Rana (0) couldn't fend off a rising delivery and was caught at backward point. Nitish Reddy top scored for India with 42 off 47 balls and was out caught off Cummins again trying to score quick runs. It was the skipper's first five wicket haul at the Adelaide Oval and went a long way to assuring Australia's winning streak in day-night tests at the venue remained intact. Mohammed Siraj was last man out, caught off Scott Boland who finished with 3-51 in his return to the team in place of the injured Josh Hazlewood. None of the Indian batters passed 50 across the two innings – India previously suffered the same fate in the 2021 world test championship final against New Zealand at Southampton. Needing just 19 runs to win the test and level the series, McSweeney (10 not out) and Khawaja (12 not out) saw Australia home safely in 3.2 overs. ""There's definitely a way for us to get back into the game, and we need to find that within ourselves,"" India captain Rohit Sharma said. ""There are a lot of individuals in that dressing room who have played a lot of cricket, won a lot of games, have come back from difficult situations in the past. ""We hope that everyone stands up to that challenge and takes the team through whenever it's required."" India was bowled out for 180 runs in the first innings on the back of Starc's career best figures of 6-48. Travis Head scored a blistering 140 off 141 balls to propel Australia to 337 runs in reply and take a 157-run lead. Australia's quicks then dismantled India's top order in the second innings under lights to leave the match strongly in the hosts favour heading into the third day. The teams will play a third test beginning Dec. 14 in Brisbane followed by matches in Melbourne starting Dec. 26 and in Sydney from Jan. 3.","test, the, innings, runs, adelaide, reddy, hazlewood, nitish, starc, dec, josh, wicket, series, quicks, rohit, tactic, 337, delivery, miracle, mcsweeney"

With less than 40 minutes remaining in the match, Nathan Lyon trapped Mohammed Siraj lbw to bowl India out for 155 in its second innings and complete a remarkable match that had more than 370,000 people attend across the five days. Australia now takes a 2-1 advantage ahead of the fifth and final test which is scheduled to start on Jan. 3 at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where avoiding a defeat will be enough to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in 10 years. ""It's probably the best test match I've been involved in,"" said man-of-the-match Cummins, who took 3-28 off 18 overs Monday for six wickets in the match, plus playing valuable innings of 49 and 41 at No.8. ""I don't know what the crowd was today, but it was huge. ""Overall, it was one of those great wins."" Earlier, India had been 25 without loss when Pat Cummins produced a double-wicket maiden, dismissing Rohit Sharma (9) and K.L. Rahul (0). India went to lunch at a shaky 33-3, losing the crucial wicket of Virat Kohli in the final over of the session when the star right-hander was caught at first slip for five off Mitchell Starc's bowling. Rishabh Pant (30 off 104 balls) and opener Yashavi Jaiswal added 88 runs for the fourth wicket. But with India seemingly playing for a draw, Pant aggressively clubbed a delivery from part-time spinner Travis Head to long-on and was caught at 121-4 just after tea, sparking a calamitous seven-wicket collapse for the visitors. India lost three wickets for nine runs as Scott Boland (3-39) removed Ravindra Jadeja (2) caught behind and first-innings century-maker Nitish Kumar Reddy (1) edged to slip off the bowling of spinner Lyon (2-37). In a pivotal moment of the innings, Jaiswal was given out after Australia called for a review when an appeal for caught-behind was turned down by umpire Joel Wilson. Despite no sound being picked up on 'snicko', video replays appeared to show the ball glanced off the bat and glove and Jaiswal had to depart for 84 off the bowling of Cummins (3-28) at 140-7. With less than an over remaining before the final hour of play was due to start, Wilson again turned Australia's appeal down and the decision was overturned following a review by the hosts. Boland claimed his second wicket as Akash Deep fell, caught at bat-pad for 17 at 150-8. Boland struck again to remove Jasprit Bumrah for a duck and Siraj was lbw to Lyon in the last over before the second new ball was due and sparked wild celebrations among the Australian players and in the stands. But with a fifth test starting Friday and the possibility that India could still win in Sydney and draw the series 2-2 to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Cummins said there was little time for celebrations. ""It's a short turnaround. We'll savor this for a couple of hours at least and then it will be recovery for the next three days,"" Cummins said. ""You gear up again for the last test of the summer. It's a mix of happiness and rest for the next three days."" A crowd of 74,362 for Monday's fifth day of play lifted the total attendance to 373,691, beating the previous record for a Melbourne test match of 350,534 in the 1936-37 Ashes series. Australia was dismissed in its second innings for 234 on Monday morning. Bumrah (5-57) claimed his 13th five-wicket haul by bowling Lyon (41) in the second over of the morning after the home side resumed on 228-9. Bumrah, 31, is the leading wicket-taker in the series with 30 victims at an average of 12.83. The 44-test veteran took match figures of 9-156. Bumrah is the only player in test history with at least 200 wickets and a bowling average under 20 (203 at 19.42). Steve Smith top-scored with 140 in Australia's first innings of 474. India replied with 369, led by Reddy's 114. ""It is pretty disappointing. We wanted to fight until the end but unfortunately we couldn't do it,"" India's captain Rohit Sharma said. ""We had our chances. We just didn't take them and we let Australia come back into the game when we had them 91 for six (in its second innings).""","test, the, wicket, melbourne, match, innings, lyon, bowling, final, yashavi, joel, wickets, crowd, reddy, ashes, wilson, nitish, appeal, jaiswal, starc"

Bumrah dominated Australia's middle order, removing Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh and Alex Carey cheaply before the home side's tail wagged, reaching 228-9 at stumps, with one day of play remaining. Australia leads by 333 runs. Earlier, Australia lost four wickets for 11 runs in 22 deliveries, slumping from 80-2 to 91-6 in a dramatic middle-order collapse after lunch. But the home side rallied thanks to a 57-run partnership between Marnus Labuschagne (70) and Pat Cummins (41). India resumed Sunday on 358-9 and was bowled out for 369 in reply to the home side's 474. Nitish Kumar Reddy top-scored with 114. It was the 21-year-old's maiden century in his fourth test. Cummins (3-89), Scott Boland (3-57) and spinner Nathan Lyon (3-96) took three wickets each. Reddy said to have family and friends including his father Mutyala watching on when he scored his maiden test century was a special moment. ""That was a special century for me and for my father,"" Reddy said. ""When I was nothing, the first person who believed in me was my father. He believed in me and he resigned his job for me. ""He made a lot of sacrifices. I'm so grateful to have a father like him."" Australia edged slowly to 53-2 off 25 overs in its second innings at lunch Sunday on a pitch that continued to offer sideways movement. Openers Sam Kontas (eight) and Usman Khawaja (21) departed before lunch. Mohammed Siraj (3-66) triggered a collapse by removing first-innings century-maker Steve Smith caught behind for 13 at 80-3. In the next over, Bumrah broke through twice. The 31-year-old claimed his 200th wicket, removing Head caught at forward-square leg for one, and Marsh was caught behind four balls later for a duck. The 44-test capped Bumrah claimed his fourth wicket of the innings when he bowled Carey (2) in his next over as Australia staggered to 91-6. Labuschagne described the bowling of Bumrah, who has taken 29 wickets in the series at an average of 13.24, as ""relentless"". ""He just bowls a relentless length. He attacks the stumps. He's tough to navigate,"" Labuschagne said. ""He was hot. He had three wickets in two overs. He's been very good this series."" Yashavi Jaiswal missed three catches in the field, including dropping Labuschagne at gully on 46, and Cummins on 21 at silly point. Australia regained its composure, pushing its lead beyond 250, before Siraj trapped Labuschagne lbw at 148-7. Mitchell Starc (5) was run out shortly after tea at 156-8. Cummins was caught at slip 17 runs later, but India fumbled a fourth chance when Siraj put down a caught-and-bowled chance when Lyon was on five. Lyon (41 not out) and Boland (10 not out) added to India's frustrations with an unbeaten 55-run partnership for the final wicket. Bumrah had Lyon caught in slips on 35 in the final over of the day, but it was a no-ball. The highest successful run-chase in a test match since 2000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground is Australia's 231-2 in 2013/2014 against England. Reddy said it would be important to have ""one or two good partnerships"" to give India a chance of victory. ""We can see later on the fourth day the pitch was doing a little bit more,"" Reddy said. ""We don't need to put more pressure (on ourselves) by saying the pitch is doing this or that."" The five-match series is level at 1-1. The fifth and final Australia-India test is scheduled to start on Jan. 3 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.","test, fourth, bumrah, father, the, century, 4th, tail, chance, collapse, innings, australia, wicket, steve, maiden, wickets, melbourne, runs, series, mitchell"

The 30-year-old Head has been in strong form, hitting centuries in Adelaide and Brisbane. Head has made 409 runs at an average of 81.80 across the first three tests of the five-test Border-Gavaskar series, dominating India even as the rest of Australia's batters have faced significant issues against fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah. The series is level at 1-1 after the third test in Brisbane ended in a rainy draw. Australia coach Andrew McDonald said Tuesday he was ""confident"" Head would play but still needed to overcome a small calf strain. After not training a day earlier due to a tight quadricep muscle from the Brisbane test, the star left-hander had a short stint in the Melbourne Cricket Ground nets on Tuesday when he received throw downs for about 20 minutes. McDonald said Tuesday that the 19-year-old Konstas will make his test debut at the MCG. After being called into the squad in place of opener Nathan McSweeney, Konstas will become one of Australia's youngest test cricketers. The last time Konstas played at the MCG, he made three and 73 not out for Australia A last month against India A.","test, konstas, melbourne, australia, cricket, mcdonald, mcsweeney, gavaskar, andrew, sam, nathan, travis, jasprit, bumrah, head, the, quadricep, 409, nets, mcg"

After four days of play, India was 252-9 in its first innings, trailing Australia by 193 runs, which scored 445 in its first innings. More importantly, India avoided having to follow-on with a late flurry of tail-end runs in fading light Tuesday, forcing Australia to bat again and almost ensuring a draw by the end of the fifth day on Wednesday. With the five-test series level at 1-1 and Brisbane touted as being a pivotal test in the series, it has turned out to be anything but. Rain delay after rain delay has spoiled the Gabba match and forced Cricket Australia to refund tickets to about 35,000 spectators who attended the first day because not enough overs were bowled. KL Rahul top-scored for India with 84 runs before being caught by Steve Smith off Nathan Lyon's bowling. A 10th-wicket partnership Tuesday between Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep took India from 213-9 to 252-9 at stumps. Australia will have to take one more wicket on the fifth day and either bat again or declare their innings for nil and risk losing the test if India can chase down the remaining runs. Only 13 overs were bowled on the first day Saturday and there were eight stoppages of play due to rain on the third day Monday. That continued Tuesday morning and rain returned to delay the start of play after lunch, then again after only two overs were bowled. Bad light finally stopped play Tuesday after only 58 overs were bowled on the day. Australia could be a bowler down for the remainder of the test after Josh Hazlewood suffered calf soreness ahead of the fourth day's play and was only able to send down one over before leaving the field. Hazlewood, who missed the second Adelaide test due to side soreness, was late entering the field at the start of play and then looked labored when he came into the attack. India won the first test by 295 runs at Perth, while Australia came back to win the second day-night test in Adelaide by 10 wickets.","test, day, the, runs, soreness, rain, gabba, overs, draw, only, lyon, light, nathan, delay, brisbane, cricket, stoppages, end, 193, third"

The first captain to win international title in 2010, Khadka led Nepal to first-ever World Cup in 2014 and he was the captain of the national team that earned One Day International status for the first time four years later. He also became the first Nepali batter to score centuries in both ODI and Twenty20 formats. Off-the-field, Khadka led a strong protest against the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) after the governing body failed to meet players' requirements. He stepped down from captaincy in 2019 and retired from the sport two years later, announcing his new innings in cricket administration. Khadka, who was elected the CAN secretary in September last year, is the most powerful cricket administrator at present. Khadka and CAN have already created waves with the grand launch of the Nepal Premier League, which was successful in attracting legendary figures of world cricket in first edition itself. Mahesh Acharya from The Himalayan Times caught up with Khadka to discuss the uniting force of cricket, challenges and potentials in establishing a sports culture in Nepal, cricketing climate, among other issues. Excerpts: What role does cricket play in uniting fans and communities in Nepal and the region? Cricket has evolved into a sport capable of bringing nations together. From early childhood, one can see kids' joy in participating in games and sports. We have also sought to establish a sports culture in Nepal for a long time. With the Nepal Premier League (NPL) setup, I think we are on the right track. Nepali cricket has always received tremendous support from fans, and we want to ensure that we repay them with a better setting, experience and entertainment. People enjoy visiting cricket grounds, seeing Nepal play and even keenly following the NPL. How has Nepal's cricketing journey evolved, and what role has cricket played in the region? We have begun developing relationships with the BCCI, the Indian Cricket Board. Cricket playing nations surround us on the subcontinent. That means we need to engage much more with cricket boards in the region as well. There is much to share and much to learn within our region. After 25 years, I've noticed the significant impact of adjacent countries and players. We grew up seeing them play. We now hold ODI status, have competed in two World Cups, and have participated in the Asia Cup. We were agonisingly close to defeating a Test-playing nation in the World Cup. With all these features in place, Nepali cricket has evolved, gaining expertise and experience in the region and contributing to it. The improvement of Nepali cricket on the pitch is incredible. Cricket, in addition to connecting people, has the potential to benefit Nepal's economy significantly. If we can create a suitable stadium with a capacity of 25,000 and attract fans, we can generate significant funds from ticket sales for a single international match. What steps have been taken to improve the cricket infrastructure in Nepal? The government is currently installing infrastructure on the TU premises. All of the backend work has been accomplished. The complete tender is about to begin, and the government has pledged that the tender process will be fast-tracked. There is no doubt that TU is the home of Nepali cricket, and we must manage this facility. The private sector is also looking to invest in infrastructure. So, it may be through the government's initiatives or private-public cooperation, but we need cricket infrastructure. What are the perspectives of young Nepali cricketers on regional cricket culture? Everyone grows up watching someone. Cricket is also quite popular among Nepali youth, and many parents urge their children to participate in this sport. We've also noticed growing interest in the game of cricket among parents. Building a culture will take time. We must ensure that aspiring players and parents see a steady future in cricket. The national team players are having a great time. However, the scenario varies across provincial and district players. First and foremost, the association must be financially stable so that we can manage finances for provinces and districts. We need to entice individuals to join the sport for the long term. No one will join a sport unless there is a clear professional pathway. We initially played cricket for free, but things have changed since then. It's about finding a career, and I believe cricket is gradually becoming one. How has the growing popularity of cricket affected cultural perceptions in Nepal? Look at our women's under-19 team as to how their performance has gotten them to the World Cup this time around. As someone who has played the game for nearly two decades, I can relate to various stories. While sports have health benefits, they also teach you much about discipline, dedication and consistency. It's the same in life. A good player does not emerge from a single day, game or tournament. Life has ups and downs. People look up to many who have played the game and helped Nepal succeed. The full influence will be seen in the future. In order to become a proficient player who performs consistently, you must be disciplined. What collaborations are in place to help Nepali players enhance their skills and receive training? It's about improving the cricketing climate. We're attempting to connect with India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Perhaps some players can play club cricket in England and Australia as well. That is the plan. We have been pretty busy for the last 14-15 months with the World Cup, its preparations, and the organisation of many national events. There have been a lot of events in the last year-and-a-half, and the players have stayed occupied, which is excellent. However, we must aim to decentralise events and ensure adequate pitches and sites nationwide. Having stated that, all we need to do is keep moving forward without complicating things too much. Everything has its graph, with ups and downs, but I believe we are at a point where we have tremendous potential to expand our horizon in the cricketing arena. How do cricket tournaments and leagues promote regional cooperation? More events will come to Nepal if you have good infrastructure. That's one thing. We need to discuss the internal scenario, namely cricket's role. We're having an event in Kirtipur, and people are coming from all across the country to witness the game. Imagine three years from now, if we can structure the NPL on a home-and-away basis, people will go to different provinces to watch matches. Cities in the Indian Premier League also look forward to 8-10 games per season. We can build a similar scenario here. I am confident that cricket can help to bring the country together. The IPL is a massive product that is a benchmark and inspiration. We, too, want to provide the best entertainment for those who come to the stadium and those who watch games on television. There are numerous reasons to bring our contests to a global audience. Through the telecast of the matches, people will learn about cricket and our country. How do you see Nepal using its cricketing talent to promote regional pride and identity? I recall that we were pretty hard-working cricketers and had excellent trainers. So, that mixture has led us to where we are now. We're attempting to create a profitable cricket system where young cricketers can come, play the game, obtain a job, and improve their livelihood. It will take time, but I believe we have started nicely.","cricket, the, cricketing, players, scenario, cricketers, world, sport, boards, npl, association, tender, league, regional, cup, first, nepali, years, premier, cups"

The report was handed over by a diverse group of young representatives: Anuska Rawal (11, Karnali Province), Shreya Thapa (13, Bagmati Province), Matrika Prasad Upadhaya (16, Sudurpaschim Province), Ram Sunari Magar (18, Lumbini Province), and Pinki Kumari Sharma (21, Madhesh Province). Their presentation coincided with the global observance of World Children's Day, a day that marks the adoption anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and is recognized internationally as UNICEF's Global Day of Action for children. This year, UNICEF is calling on the world to listen to the future - to engage children in discussions about their vision and aspirations, fostering intergenerational conversations on both global challenges and personal dreams. Notable attendees included Vice Chair of the National Planning Commission Prof. Dr. Shivaraj Adhikari, Virginie Corteval, the French Ambassador to Nepal; Her Excellency Torun Dramdal, the Norwegian Ambassador to Nepal; Jose Luis Vinuesa-Santamaria, Head of Cooperation, the European Union Delegation to Nepal; Shivani Mishra, Education Advisor, British Embassy; UNICEF Representative to Nepal Alice Akunga, representatives from Ministries of Women, Children and Senior Citizens; Health and Population; Education, Science and Technology; Water Supply; children and young people, and the media. The report is a culmination of UNICEF's year-long consultations and interactions with around 400 children and young people across Nepal, including at provincial levels and at the Local Conference of Youths Nepal (LCOY) as well as through national multi-stakeholder consultations supported by UNICEF, in coordination with the Government of Nepal, youth networks and development partners. It comes at a crucial moment with Nepal currently preparing to finalize its third generation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs 3.0) and other key climate actions and policies, as per the release issued by the UNICEF. Minister Thakuri emphasized,""As Nepal prepares to finalize our next set of climate commitments, including the NDC 3.0, this report is a critical reminder to place children and young people at the center of decision-making, ensuring their voices shape our climate-resilient future."" In addition to sharing about how climate change is impacting the lives of children and young people, the report calls on adults to take specific actions: Actively involving children and young people in climate policy-making. Establish eco-friendly schools and equip youth with job-ready skills. Strengthen climate-resilient health and water, sanitation and hygiene systems to address environmental health risks and to ensure continuity in essential services during disasters. Promote food security by supporting climate-smart agriculture, food storage and access to reliable climate data. Build disaster-resilient communities using clean energy, through afforestation and by preparing communities for climate-induced disasters. Ensure inclusivity by amplifying marginalized voices and integrating indigenous knowledge into climate action. UNICEF Representative Alice Akunga commended the insights and leadership of children and young people, saying, ""The energy, ideas, and determination of children and young people inspire us all. Listening to them today builds a foundation for climate action that is inclusive, bold and rooted in the realities of those most affected by climate change."" She also highlighted the urgent need to invest in resilient social services to reduce climate risk for millions of children. ""Prioritizing the resilience of social services that children and young people rely on, along with including young people's voices in climate policies and plans, is one of the best investments governments can make,"" Akunga said. According to UNICEF estimates, US$ 1 invested in adaptation may yield up to US$ 10 in economic gains. During the event, children and adults co-created their visions of a ""sustainable future."" Following the creative session, participants shared their artwork, highlighting key actions they commit to taking in support of a sustainable future for Nepal's children. ""Children represent our future"", says 21-year-old Pinki Kumari Sharma from Madhesh Province. ""Just as we care for young plants to ensure future generations enjoy their fruits, we must nurture and invest in children today to equip them for a brighter and sustainable tomorrow.""","climate, unicef, the, children, young, action, future, province, voices, resilient, emphasized, dramdal, pinki, torun, alice, shivaraj, akunga, matrika, thakuri, actions"

Earlier today, the CPN-UML Kathmandu District Committee had submitted a 7-point memorandum to Mayor Balen Shah. Balen shared a photo of CPN-UML provincial lawmaker Rekha Sharma, writing, ""She is CPN-UML provincial MP Rekha Sharma. She has kept a prisoner for the past eight years and has been abusing a minor girl, saying she is a domestic worker. She beats her on a daily basis. This government has not arrested her despite the fact that Kathmandu Metropolis has been struggling for the past two months for legal redress. The court has already ruled to prosecute her."" Balen not only mentioned a CPN-UML legislator, but he also brought up the name of the party chairperson and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. ""Honourable Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli Jyu. Good governance entails obeying a court order, which includes arresting your MP, Rekha Sharma, who has a history of child abuse."" His post reads further, ""Perhaps for you, good governance implies shedding crocodile tears and making a hundred thousand Facebook announcements following the death of an innocent girl. When will you nab her?"" he questioned. ""Or not??"" A 7-point memorandum to Mayor Balen Shah from the UML Kathmandu District Committee stated that based on the Supreme Court's decision, the CPN-UML filed a memorandum with Balen opposing the decision to prohibit the construction of buildings on the land for 20 metres beyond the specified distance. The UML has demanded that the KMC's notification affect and victimise millions of people and that the decision be revoked. Deepak Niraula, president of the UML Kathmandu, has warned KMC that if the decision is not reversed, unusual circumstances will arise, potentially leading to serious repercussions. Balen stated on Facebook a week ago that following the SCs order, KMC was informed of the order and the construction prohibited area. ""No new structures can be built on that land. According to the court's decision, if the people are not prevented from enjoying their land, the Nepalese government can only acquire it by paying compensation,"" reads his post. ""Party leaders and cadres should not cause confusion among the people by misinterpreting the court order as the metropolis' decision."" Meanwhile, the majority of the netizens have commented against CPN-UML, expressing dissatisfaction against the cruel act from CPN-UML leader Sharma. Balen's posts piqued the attention of hundreds of thousands of netizens within an hour, with over 103,000 likes, 16,200 comments, and 8,800 shares. The comment by Binod Tripathi reads, ""Thank you, Balen, for raising a very deep and painful topic. Leave politics, party, prejudice, and hybridity out of these issues, UML President and current Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli."" He goes on to say, ""If you truly want to make Nepal gender-friendly, do not remain silent on such sensitive issues. Avoid bringing up politics. Women's freedom encompasses more than just women holding high positions. It is that every girl and woman enjoys freedom and feels safe on their own."" Previously, in June, Netizens went berserk, inundating the comment section after Balen's post alleging Oli's involvement in a Rs 100 billion scam in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land swap of 343.19 bigha (232.43 hectares). Balen and Prime Minister and CPN-UML chief Oli were trending on social media, while netizens had taken a trolling over Oli for his involvement in the Rs 100 billion scam in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land swap. Balen and Oli were trending following a dispute between the Road Division Department Kathmandu and the KMC over a blacktopping road section in the New Road area when Raghubir Mahasetha of the CPN-UML was Minister of Physical and Infrastructure Development.","uml, cpn, balen, the, oli, sharma, court, kmc, shah, road, rekha, memorandum, metropolis, land, girl, jyu, netizens, decision, legislator, order"

Shah demanded the arrest of CPN-UML Lumbini Province MP Rekha Sharma on Facebook on Sunday evening. Today he requested that Prime Minister Oli train UML leaders in general knowledge. Balen took to Facebook again today. He stated that Rekha Kumari Sharma, a Lumbini Provincial UML MP, has stated that she has been filing cases in the Supreme and High Courts to avoid going to jail for the crime she committed. He also claimed that she would lose the case. Shah wrote on Facebook that the police had not investigated the charge against her. Case has not been filed in the court, and all we have requested is that action be taken in accordance with the crime she committed. ""Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli, you should train your cadres in general knowledge before involving them in politics because if you get the chance to run the country later without such knowledge, their situation will be the same as yours, following others' orders,"" Balen told Oli. A child worker was rescued from UML lawmaker Rekha Sharma's home in June. KMC rescued the child because Sharma used to beat the minor and forced her to work every day, abusing her fundamental rights. She is currently being housed by an organisation. Kathmandu Metropolis has been pursuing legal action against Sharma for forcing minors to work as domestic chores. Mayor Shah said that despite the court ordering the case to be prosecuted, Sharma was not arrested. ""Honourable Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli Jyu. Good governance entails obeying a court order, which includes arresting your MP, Rekha Sharma, who has a history of child abuse."" His post reads further, ""Perhaps for you, good governance implies shedding crocodile tears and making a hundred thousand Facebook announcements following the death of an innocent girl. When will you nab her?"" he questioned. Prime Minister Oli has not responded to this. The CPN-UML's fraternal organisation, which includes the district committee and ANNFSU, has already entered the fray. Deepak Niraula, president of the UML Kathmandu, submitted a 7-point memorandum warning the KMC that if the decision not to allow construction in the mentioned area is not reversed, unusual circumstances will arise, potentially leading to serious consequences. Meanwhile, ANNFSU President Samik Badal accused Mayor Balen of colluding with the Indian intelligence agency on Facebook. Badal's status updates reveal that Balen rents a house behind the Sangrila Hotel and meets with the Indian Intelligence Agency on a daily basis. Badal also defended Rekha Sharma, who posted another defensive status after being chastised for using abusive language against Balen. He stated that if MP Sharma is found to have committed child abuse, the party and the government should take legal action. Although MP Sharma's alleged child labour exploitation is flaunted, this is not the primary reason for UML and Balen's conflict. This is due to restrictions on the construction of buildings and other structures along Kathmandu's riverside. The Bagmati and its tributary (Bishnumati Manohara) rivers in Kathmandu have a 20-metre right-to-left flow area. According to the SC order, no structures can be built in the river's downstream area, states Mayor Balen. He has also emphasised that Party leaders and cadres should avoid causing public confusion by misinterpreting the court order as the metropolis' decision. However, the UML has said that the KMC's notification affects and victimises millions of people, so the decision must be reversed.","uml, balen, rekha, sharma, the, mp, badal, kmc, oli, khadga, mayor, child, lumbini, metropolis, shah, samik, manohara, jyu, intelligence, bishnumati"

Also, another meeting of the university within the next month will take appropriate decisions to this end and the same meeting will also discuss other challenges and difficulties, PM Oli said.

Nepal has a troubling history of air crashes. In a recent incident, 72 people were killed when Yeti Airlines Flight NYT691 en route to Pokhara Airport crashed on January 15, 2023. The crash was attributed to human error, according to the report submitted by the Investigation Commission formed after the incident. In May 2022, a Tara Air plane en route to Jomsom of Mustang from Pokhara crashed on a cliff at the base of the Manapathi Peak in Mustang, killing all 22 onboard, including three crew members. On March 12, 2018, a Bombardier Q400 series aircraft operated by US-Bangla Airlines crashed near the runway, killing 49 people. In 2012, a Thai Airways flight from Bangkok crashed in Kathmandu, killing all 113 people onboard. Nepal's deadliest air crash occurred in 1992 when a Pakistan International Airlines aircraft crashed, killing 167 people. This latest crash adds to Nepal's poor air safety record, raising further concerns. Saurya Airlines operates flights to five destinations within Nepal using Bombardier CRJ-200 jets, according to its website. The aircraft involved in today's crash, built in Montreal, Canada, was over 21 years old and brought to Nepal in 2017. It was scheduled for a routine technical inspection in Pokhara. ""The aircraft was to fly to Pokhara for a technical examination required as per the regular schedule after flying certain hours, not because of any fault,"" said Jasoda Subedi, Spokesperson of Pokhara International Airport.

Following the crash, Prime Minister Oli called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the implications of the incident and measures to enhance aviation safety.

A Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air came down with its front landing gear closed and struck a concrete fence Sunday at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea, killing 179 people. The deadliest accident in aviation history occurred in 1977, when two Boeing 747 jumbo jets collided on a foggy runway on the Spanish island of Tenerife, killing 583 of the 644 people on board the planes. Spanish investigators blamed the captain of the KLM 747 for taking off without clearance from air traffic controllers. In an act of terrorism, nearly 3,000 people died when al-Qaida hijackers crashed four jetliners into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C., and a field in southwest Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, 2001. These are some of the significant aviation accidents that happened in 2024: Jan. 2: A large passenger plane and a Japanese coast guard aircraft collided on a Tokyo runway. All five people in the coast guard plane died, but all 379 on the Japan Airlines escaped before the jet became engulfed in flames. June 10: A military plane carrying Vice President Saulos Chilima of Malawi and former first lady Shanil Dzimbiri crashes in bad weather in the southern African nation's mountainous north. They and the eight other people on board are killed. July 24: In Nepal, a Saurya Airlines plane crashed shortly after taking off from the capital of Kathmandu, killing 18 people; one of the pilots survived. The Bombardier CRJ 200 plane was flying to a maintenance shop, and most of the passengers were mechanics or airline employees. Aug. 11: A turboprop operated by Brazil's Voepass crashes, killing all 62 people on board. A preliminary report indicated that pilots saw ice building up on the outside of the plane, indicating a possible problem with the deicing system. Dec. 22: A small plane crashed in a mostly residential area of a Brazilian town popular with tourists, killing all 10 people on board and injuring more than a dozen on the ground. The cause was not immediately clear. Dec. 25: An Azerbaijan Airlines plane crashes in Kazakhstan, killing 39 people; 29 survive. Azerbaijan's president said the plane was shot down accidentally by Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized for the ""tragic incident,"" but stopped short of accepting responsibility. Dec. 28: A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 jetliner crashes in Seoul, killing 179 people. After an initial failed landing attempt, the plane received a bird strike warning from the ground control center. The pilot issued a distress signal before the plane came down, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames. Two crew members survive after being pulled from the rear of the plane.","plane, airlines, korea, the, jeju, boeing, dec, south, people, air, azerbaijan, aviation, dzimbiri, chilima, saulos, shanil, runway, crashes, qaida, 737"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/north-koreas-kim-vows-the-toughest-anti-us-policy-before-trump-takes-office,North Korea's Kim vows the toughest anti-US policy before Trump takes office,Associated Press,2024-12-30 21:23:05,"SEOUL, DECEMBER 30 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to implement the ""toughest"" anti-U.S. policy, state media reported Sunday, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president. Trump's return to the White House raises prospects for high-profile diplomacy with North Korea. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Many experts however say a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say. During a five-day plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party that ended Friday, Kim called the U.S. ""the most reactionary state that regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy."" Kim said that the U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership is expanding into ""a nuclear military bloc for aggression."" ""This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how,"" Kim said, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. It said Kim's speech ""clarified the strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction to be launched aggressively"" by North Korea for its long-term national interests and security. KCNA didn't elaborate on the anti-U.S. strategy. But it said Kim set forth tasks to bolster military capability through defense technology advancements and stressed the need to improve the mental toughness of North Korean soldiers. The previous meetings between Trump and Kim had not only put an end to their exchanges of fiery rhetoric and threats of destruction, but they developed personal connections. Trump once famously said he and Kim ""fell in love."" But their talks eventually collapsed in 2019, as they wrangled over U.S.-led sanctions on the North. North Korea has since sharply increased the pace of its weapons testing activities to build more reliable nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their military bilateral drills and also trilateral ones involving Japan, drawing strong rebukes from the North, which views such U.S.-led exercises as invasion rehearsals. Further complicating efforts to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in return for economic and political benefits is its deepening military cooperation with Russia. According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that 3,000 North Korean troops have been killed and wounded in the fighting in Russia's Kursk region. It was the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties since the North Korean troop deployment to Russia began in October. Russia and China, locked in separate disputes with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led pushes to levy more U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its repeated missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Last month, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington's ""unchangeable"" hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats.","north, korean, korea, kim, nuclear, weapons, the, trump, south, jong, toughest, anti, security, sanctions, its, strategy, military, policy, troops, volodymyr"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/biden-announces-nearly-25b-more-in-military-aid-for-ukraine,Biden announces nearly $2.5B more in military aid for Ukraine,Associated Press,2024-12-30 21:26:59,"WASHINGTON, DECEMBER 30 President Joe Biden said Monday that the United States will send nearly $2.5 billion more in weapons to Ukraine as his administration works quickly to spend all the money it has available to help Kyiv fight off Russia before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The package includes $1.25 billion in presidential drawdown authority, which allows the military to pull existing stock from its shelves and gets weapons to the battlefield faster. It also has $1.22 billion in longer-term weapons packages to be put on contract through the separate Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, or USAI. Biden said all longer-term USAI funds have now been spent and pledged to use all the remaining drawdown money before leaving office. ""I've directed my administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible,"" Biden said in a statement. ""At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine's position in this war over the remainder of my time in office."" The new aid comes as Russia has launched a barrage of attacks against Ukraine's power facilities in recent days, although Ukraine has said it intercepted a significant number of the missiles and drones. Russian and Ukrainian forces are also still in a bitter battle around the Russian border region of Kursk, where Moscow has sent thousands of North Korean troops to help reclaim territory taken by Ukraine. The Biden administration is pushing to get weapons into Ukraine to give Kyiv the strongest negotiating position possible before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump has talked about getting some type of negotiated settlement between Ukraine and Russia and has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many U.S. and European leaders are concerned that Trump's talk of a settlement might result in a poor deal for Ukraine, and they worry that he won't provide Ukraine with all the weapons funding approved by Congress. The weapons systems being pulled from existing stockpiles through this latest weapons package include counter-unmanned aerial systems munitions, air defense munitions, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, air-to-ground munitions, anti-armor systems, tube-launched missiles, fragmentation grenades, and other items and spare parts. Including Monday's announcement, the U.S. has provided more than $65 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022.","systems, assistance, ukraine, weapons, artillery, trump, munitions, drawdown, biden, russian, security, administration, package, the, settlement, missiles, billion, putin, vladimir, fragmentation"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/zelenskyy-says-nato-offer-for-ukraine-controlled-territory-could-end-hot-stage-of-war,Zelenskyy says NATO offer for Ukraine-controlled territory could end 'hot stage' of war,Associated Press,2024-12-01 21:42:26,"KYIV, DECEMBER 1 An offer of NATO membership to territory under Kyiv's control would end ""the hot stage of the war"" in Ukraine, but any proposal to join the military alliance should be extended to all parts of the country that fall under internationally recognized borders, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a broadcast interview. Zelenskyy's remarks on Friday signaled a possible way forward to the difficult path Ukraine faces to future NATO membership. At their summit in Washington in July, the 32 members declared Ukraine on an ""irreversible"" path to membership. However, one obstacle to moving forward has been the view that Ukraine's borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the alliance's pact of mutual defense would come into effect. ""You can't give an invitation to just one part of a country,"" Zelenskyy said in an excerpt of the interview with Sky News. ""Why? Because thus you would recognize that Ukraine is only that territory of Ukraine and the other one is Russia."" Under the Ukrainian Constitution, Ukraine can't recognize territory occupied by Russia as Russian. ""So legally, by law, we have no right to recognize the occupied territory as territory of Russia,"" he said. Since the start of the war in 2022, Russia has been expending huge amounts of weaponry and human life to make small-but-steady territorial gains to the nearly one-fifth of Ukraine it already controls in east and southern Ukraine. ""If we want to stop the hot stage of the war, we should take under the NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control. That's what we need to do, fast. And then Ukraine can get back the other part of its territory diplomatically,"" he said. An invitation for Ukraine to join NATO is one key point of Zelenskyy's ""victory plan,"" which he presented to Western allies and the Ukrainian people in October. The plan is seen as a way for Ukraine to strengthen its hand in any negotiations with Moscow. Earlier this week, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that the alliance ""needs to go further"" to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. Military aid to Kyiv and steps toward ending the war are expected to be high on the agenda when NATO members' foreign ministers meet in Brussels for a two-day gathering starting on Dec. 3. However, any decision for Ukraine to join the military alliance would require a lengthier process and the agreement of all member states. There is also uncertainty as to the foreign policy stance of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. While Trump vowed on the campaign trail to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine in a single day, he hasn't publicly discussed how this could happen. Trump also announced Wednesday that Keith Kellogg, an 80-year-old, highly decorated retired three-star general, would serve as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. In April, Kellog wrote that ""bringing the Russia-Ukraine war to a close will require strong, America First leadership to deliver a peace deal and immediately end the hostilities between the two warring parties."" Meanwhile, during his only campaign debate with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war - raising concerns that Kyiv could be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations. Zelenskyy's statement comes as Ukraine faces increasing pressure along the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. In its latest report, Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War said Saturday that Russian forces had recently advanced near Kupiansk, in Toretsk, and near Pokrovsk and Velyka Novosilka, a key logistics route for the Ukrainian military. At least four people were killed Saturday when a Russian missile hit Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Serhiy Lysak said that the strike also wounded at least 21 people, of which eight were in a serious condition. Ukraine's air force announced Saturday that the country had come under attack from 10 Russian drones, of which eight were shot down over the Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson regions. One drone returned to Russian-occupied territory, while the final drone disappeared from radar, often a sign of the use of electronic defenses. Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said that 11 Ukrainian drones had been shot down by the country's air defense systems. Both the mayor of Sochi, Andrey Proshunin, and the head of Russia's Dagestan region, Sergey Melikov, both in Russia's southwest, said that drones had been destroyed in their regions overnight. No casualties were reported. On Friday, the Ukrainian president announced a number of changes to military leadership, saying that changes in personnel management were needed to improve the situation on the battlefield. Gen. Mykhailo Drapatyi, who led the defense of Kharkiv during Russia's new offensive on Ukraine's second-largest city this year, was appointed the new head of Ukraine's Ground Forces. Oleh Apostol was named as the new deputy commander-in-chief responsible for improving military training. Ukraine's top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, also announced Friday that he would bolster units in Donetsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove with additional reserves, ammunition, weapons and military equipment. ___ Katie Marie Davies contributed to this report from Manchester, England.","the, ukraine, nato, dnipropetrovsk, military, zelenskyy, ukrainian, territory, russian, war, russia, kyiv, defense, one, alliance, kirovohrad, serhiy, syrskyi, oleksandr, drapatyi"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/trump-expresses-doubts-putin-is-willing-to-end-the-ukraine-war-a-day-after-saying-a-deal-was-close,"Trump expresses doubts Putin is willing to end the Ukraine war, a day after saying a deal was close",Associated Press,2025-04-27 22:02:16,"ROME, APRIL 27 President Donald Trump said Saturday that he doubts Russia's Vladimir Putin wants to end his war in Ukraine, expressing new skepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon. Only a day earlier, Trump had said Ukraine and Russia were "" very close to a deal."" ""There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,"" Trump said in a social media post as he flew back to the United States after attending Pope Francis' funeral at the Vatican, where he met briefly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump also hinted at further sanctions against Russia. ""It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ""Banking"" or ""Secondary Sanctions?"" Too many people are dying!!!"" Trump wrote. The new doubts aired by Trump come as the president and top aides intensify their push to come to a deal to end the war that began in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. The comments also sharply contrasted with Trump's positive assessment that the two sides were ""very close to a deal"" after his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin in Moscow on Friday. The Trump-Zelenskyy conversation on the sidelines of the pope's funeral was the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders since they argued during a heated Oval Office meeting at the White House in late February. That confrontation led the White House to briefly pause U.S. military assistance and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Days after ordering the pause, Trump also announced he was ""strongly considering"" imposing new sanctions and tariffs on Russia to try to prod Putin to negotiate in earnest. Trump has not yet followed through on the threat - something even some of his staunch Republican allies are now pressuring him to do. In fact, when Trump announced new global tariffs this month, one major economy he excluded was Russia's. U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, on Friday urged Trump to ""put the toughest of sanctions on Putin,"" arguing there is ""clear evidence that he is playing America as a patsy."" It's the second time in a matter of days that Trump has rebuked Putin, whom the American president rarely publicly criticizes. On Thursday, Trump publicly urged the Russian leader to ""STOP!"" after a deadly barrage of attacks on Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. After their brief meeting Saturday, Zelenskyy's office had said the U.S. and Ukrainian teams were making arrangements for the leaders to talk again Saturday. But Trump went directly to the Rome airport after the funeral and boarded Air Force One for the 10-hour flight back to the United States. Zelenskyy's spokesperson, Serhii Nykyforov, said Trump and Zelenskyy did not meet again in person because of their tight schedules. Zelenskyy called it a ""good meeting"" on social media after the funeral. ""We discussed a lot one on one. Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out,"" said the Ukrainian leader, who also held talks Saturday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ""Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results. Thank you."" The White House said the discussion was ""very productive."" The meeting lasted about 15 minutes inside St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, where Francis often preached the need for a peaceful end to the war, just before Trump and Zelenskyy took their seats at the outdoor funeral service. The Vatican long ago had offered to help facilitate peace talks and Francis had regularly called for peace and dialogue from the altar of the basilica. That Trump and Zelenskyy spoke privately, face to face and hunched over on chairs on the marbled floors of the pope's home, on the day of his funeral, was perhaps a fitting way to honor his wishes. Trump said on social media, after he arrived in Italy late Friday, that Russia and Ukraine should meet for ""very high level talks"" on ending the war. Neither Putin nor Zelenskyy have commented on Trump's calls for direct talks. Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to a war-ending agreement, but while Zelenskyy agreed to an American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, Russia has not signed on and has continued to strike at targets inside Ukraine. Putin did not attend Francis' funeral. He faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, which has accused him of war crimes stemming from Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, in a statement Friday night, Zelenskyy said ""very significant meetings may take place"" in the coming days, and reiterated his calls for an unconditional ceasefire. ""Real pressure on Russia is needed so that they accept either the American proposal to cease fire and move towards peace, or our proposal - whichever one can truly work and ensure a reliable, immediate, and unconditional ceasefire, and then - a dignified peace and security guarantees,"" he said. ""Diplomacy must succeed. And we are doing everything to make diplomacy truly meaningful and finally effective."" The meeting Saturday also came shortly after Trump had issued his most definitive statement to date about the need for Ukraine to give up territory to Russia to bring the war to a close. He said in a Time magazine interview published Friday that ""Crimea will stay with Russia."" Russia seized the strategic peninsula along the Black Sea in southern Ukraine in 2014, years before the full-scale invasion that began in 2022. Zelenskyy wants to regain Crimea and other Ukrainian territory seized by Russia, but Trump considers that demand to be unrealistic. Russia has also seized Ukrainian territory in the Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since invading in February 2022. Referring to Crimea during the interview, which was conducted at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said, ""everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time,"" meaning Russia.","the, funeral, sanctions, zelenskyy, trump, ukrainian, war, basilica, pope, president, rome, ceasefire, grassley, chuck, meeting, ursula, von, unconditional, der, putin"

U.S. President Donald Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei are among the leaders arriving Friday, the last day Argentine pope will lie in state in St. Peter's Basilica before his coffin is sealed in the evening in preparation for his funeral Saturday. The Vatican said 130 delegations are confirmed, including 50 heads of state and 10 reigning sovereigns. Paying respects Tens of thousands of mourners have waited hours in line to bid farewell to Francis, who died Monday after suffering a stroke at the age of 88. A higher-than-expected turnout prompted the Vatican to extend the basilica's opening hours overnight. By Thursday evening, more than 90,000 mourners had filed past Francis' open coffin placed in front of the basilica's main altar - at times praying, at times holding smart phones aloft for a photo of the late pontiff laid out in red robes, a bishop's pointed miter and a rosary entwined in his hands. St. Peter's Basilica remained open until around 3 a.m. Friday and closed for just a few hours before reopening for mourners who started arriving before dawn. The public viewing is scheduled to end at 7 p.m., after which Francis simple wooden coffin will be sealed. Emanuela Bisco took the day off work to pay her last respects to Francis, as she had 20 years ago for St. John Paul II. Francis ""was the pope of the forgotten, who was close to the simplest people, the homeless who were not pushed away,'' Bisco said. ""I hope that the next pope will be at his level, and continue his struggles, his openness, everything that he did."" Cardinals meet The work of the conclave to choose a new pope won't start until at least May 5, after nine days of public mourning. Cardinals have been also been arriving in Rome, with 113 meeting Thursday morning to discuss church business. They will meet again Friday before taking a break for the weekend. ""We are getting ready, but we still have not entered into the more intense phase. We are in the organizational phase,'' Italian Cardinal Fernando Filoni said Thursday. Papal burial In keeping with Francis' embrace of the marginalized, the Vatican said a group of poor and needy people will meet the pope's coffin to pay homage to him when it arrives at St. Mary Major basilica for burial on Saturday. The tomb is being prepared behind a wooden barrier within the basilica that he chose to be near an icon of the Madonna that he revered and often prayed before. Photos released by the Vatican on Friday show the marble tombstone flat against the pavement, with the simple engraving in Latin that he requested in his last testament: ""Franciscus"" Delegations Trump, who is traveling with first lady Melania Trump, is scheduled to arrive Friday, after Francis' coffin has been sealed. Among the other foreign dignitaries confirmed for the papal funeral are: - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and first lady Olena Zelenska - French President Emmanuel Macron - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer - Prince William - Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia - Hungarian President Viktor Orbán - Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva","francis, basilica, pope, vatican, coffin, st, the, peter, trump, delegations, funeral, president, zelenska, filoni, olena, orbán, letizia, lula, melania, luiz"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/pope-francis-funeral-to-be-held-saturday-with-public-viewing-starting-wednesday,"Pope Francis' funeral to be held Saturday, with public viewing starting Wednesday",Associated Press,2025-04-22 21:18:47,"VATICAN CITY, APRIL 22 Pope Francis will be laid to rest Saturday after lying in state for three days in St. Peter's Basilica, where the faithful are expected to flock to pay their respects to history's first Latin American pontiff. The cardinals met Tuesday in the Vatican's synod hall to chart the next steps before a conclave begins to choose Francis' successor, as condolences poured in from around the world. According to current norms, the conclave must begin between May 5 and 10. The cardinals set the funeral for Saturday at 10 a.m. in St. Peter's Square, to be celebrated by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re. U.S. President Donald Trump said he and first lady Melania Trump plan to attend, and Argentine President Javier Milei is also expected. The Argentine pope died Monday at age 88 after a stroke put him in a coma and led his heart to fail. He had been recovering in his apartment after being hospitalized for five weeks with pneumonia. He made his last public appearance Sunday, delivering an Easter blessing and greeting followers from his popemobile, looping around St. Peter's Square. His Easter appearance from the same loggia where he was introduced to the world as the first pope from the Americas on March 13, 2013, was a fitting bookend to a 12-year papacy that sought to shake up the church and return it to its Gospel-mandated mission of caring for the poorest. Vatican officials remember Francis ""He truly gave everything he had, up to the end,"" said Sister Nathalie Becquart, one of the highest-ranking women at the Vatican. While the ordinary faithful will have an opportunity to pay their respects beginning Wednesday, Vatican officials were allowed to say their goodbyes starting Monday evening. Speaking to reporters after she paid her respects, Becquart marveled at Francis' final Easter salute to his flock. ""He really walked with his people,"" she said. Italian Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi said it was specifically Francis' effort to promote the role of women in the church that will be one of his greatest legacies. Ravasi noted that Francis chose to be buried near his favorite icon of the Madonna, in a basilica across town, and not in the grottoes underneath St. Peter's, as is typical for popes. ""He wanted to be buried under the shadow of a woman, in this case Maria,"" said Ravasi, the Vatican's former culture minister as he arrived for Tuesday's first meeting of cardinals. ""That is significant, his desire for the church to do more for women."" The first images of Francis' body were released Tuesday, showing him in red vestments and his bishop's miter in a wooden casket, with the Vatican secretary of state praying over him in the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta hotel where he lived and died. In his final will, Francis said he wanted to be buried at St. Mary Major Basilica, which is home to the Salus Populi Romani icon of Mary. Before and after every foreign trip, Francis would go to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus, who in turn holds a jeweled golden book. Francis stopped by the basilica on his way home from the Gemelli hospital on March 23, after his 38-day stay, to deliver flowers to be placed before the icon. He returned April 12 to pray before it one last time. The world reacts Bells tolled in chapels, churches and cathedrals around the world and flags flew at half-staff in Italy, India, Taiwan and the U.S. after Francis' death was announced by the camerlengo, who takes charge of the Vatican after a pope's death. Soccer matches in Italy and Argentina were suspended in honor of the pope who was a lifelong fan of the San Lorenzo soccer club. World leaders praised Francis for his moral leadership and compassion, while ordinary faithful remembered his simplicity and humanity. ""Like every Argentine, I think he was a rebel,"" said 23-year-old Catalina Favaro, who had come to pay her respects in the Buenos Aires church where Francis discovered his priestly vocation. ""He may have been contradictory, but that was nice, too."" In East Timor, where Francis' final outdoor Mass drew nearly half of the population last September, President Jose Ramos-Horta praised Francis' courage. ""Pope Francis was a brave man who was not afraid to speak out against the rulers of the world who seek war, but do not want to seek peace,"" Ramos-Horta said. ""He challenged the powerful to act with justice, called nations to welcome the stranger, and reminded us that our common home - this Earth - is a gift we must protect for future generations,"" said Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who is Muslim. Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and has around 30 million Catholics, representing about 14% of the population. Viewing the pope's coffin The pope's formal apartments in the Apostolic Palace and in the Santa Marta hotel were sealed Monday evening, following a centuries-old ritual. Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who as camerlengo had the task of announcing the death and confirming it once the cause was determined, presided over the rituals. Francis chose not to live in the palace, but in a two-room suite in Santa Marta on the other side of Vatican City. He died there and his body was transferred to the hotel chapel in the lobby, where the private viewing was underway Tuesday for Vatican officials and members of the pontifical household. In changes made by Francis last year, his body was not placed in three wooden coffins, as it had been for previous popes. Rather, Francis was placed in a simplified wooden coffin with a zinc coffin inside. Once in St. Peter's, his casket will not be put on an elevated bier - as was the case with past popes - but will just be be placed simply facing the pews, with the Paschal candle nearby. ""He was a pope who didn't change his path when it came to getting (his hands) dirty,"" Francis' vicar for Rome, Cardinal Baldassarre Reina, said in a Mass in his honor. ""For him, poor people and migrants were the sacrament of Jesus."" Choosing the next pope After the funeral, there are nine days of official mourning, known as the ""novendiali."" During this period, cardinals arrive in Rome and meet privately before the conclave. To give everyone time to assemble, the conclave must begin 15 to 20 days after the ""sede vacante"" - the ""vacant See"" - is declared, although it can start sooner if the cardinals agree. Once the conclave begins, cardinals vote in secret sessions in the Sistine Chapel. After voting sessions, the ballots are burned in a special stove. Black smoke indicates that no pope has been elected, while white smoke indicates that the cardinals have chosen the next head of the Catholic Church. The one who has secured two-thirds of the votes wins. If he accepts, his election is announced by a cardinal from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica who tells the world: ""Habemus Papam"" - Latin for ""We have a pope.""","the, pope, francis, vatican, his, cardinal, basilica, chapel, cardinals, st, church, marta, horta, peter, coffin, easter, argentine, icon, ramos, santa"

The last poaching incident occurred on November 16, 2023, when two rhinos were killed in the Chaparchuli area. Nine individuals were arrested in connection with the case.

According to him, the pace at which the progress should have been achieved is low. The 113-km Narayangadh-Butwal section of the East-West Highway covers about 65 kilometres in the Middle East section. A six-lane road will be constructed in the market area with service lanes, three in Daunne section and four lanes in other areas. So far, only 21 kilometers of two-lane road has been completed in the eastern section. About 125 kilometers of road has to be constructed after calculating the two-lane road except the part of the bridge. In this way, more than 100 kilometers of blacktopping is yet to be done. ""The blacktopping of about 21 kilometers has been completed by calculating the one-way calculation,"" the project chief said.","road, section, expansion, percent, narayangadh, project, the, lane, butwal, construction, progress, work, kilometers, lanes, ashish, about, east, magar, 2075, calculation"

Jadeja scored 81 not out as India finished on 421-7 at stumps after resuming Friday on 119-1. England scored 246 runs in its first innings. Jadeja was India's third batter to score 50-plus runs in the first innings, after Lokesh Rahul was out caught for 86 and opener Yashasvi Jaiswal got 80. After lunch, India was still trailing by 24 runs and Rahul came out firing. Shreyas Iyer was caught at midwicket off Rehan Ahmed but the dismissal didn't bother Rahul, who hit another four fours and two sixes, shifting up the gears as he approached a century. But he perished while attacking, caught at midwicket off Tom Hartley. Rahul missed out on what would have been only his second test century in India. India was in the lead by then as Rahul had added another 65 runs with Jadeja. ""I got confidence from the South Africa tour. There was a bit of turn, and it became slower as the ball went old,"" Rahul said. ""It was a challenge to bat on this pitch, but I waited for the opportunity to play my shots. I am enjoying (being) in the middle order."" Jadeja anchored India's innings in the final two sessions. First, he added 68 runs with Srikar Bharat, who fought his way to 41 runs. The keeper-batter had a tough time against Joe Root's off spin, but settled down to face 81 balls in all. India went to tea at 309-5. Root did get reward for his hard work in the final session, finishing the day with 2-77 in 24 overs. He had earlier dismissed Jaiswal in the first over Friday. Jadeja reached his half-century off 84 balls, and his swordplay celebrations delighted the holiday crowd in Hyderabad. Fans weren't cheering when both batters ended up at the same end and Ravichandran Ashwin was run out for just one. Axar Patel (35 not out) joined Jadeja in the middle, and the duo stayed together until stumps, adding 63 runs. In the morning session, India lost both Jaiswal and Shubman Gill (23) within the first hour. But Rahul's knock helped calm things down for the hosts.","runs, century, the, test, 175, first, rahul, jaiswal, innings, lead, root, srikar, hartley, swordplay, rehan, batter, his, africa, gears, 246"

Burger's burst combined with two wickets each for Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen saw India bowled out for a paltry 131 runs in its second innings. That meant South Africa won the first test by an innings and 32 runs, taking a 1-0 lead in the two-match series. Burger finished with a match haul of 7-83 on his test debut, while Rabada finished with 7-91 across both innings. The latter had picked 5-59 in the first innings. The Proteas earlier finished the first innings on 408, thanks largely to a marathon 185-run knock from Dean Elgar. India had been bowled out for 245 in its first innings. Trailing by 163 runs, India's second innings got off to the worst possible start and never recovered. Opener Yashaswi Jaiswal had been dropped at slip off the very first ball, but he didn't survive long. He was caught behind off a rising delivery by Burger for five runs off 18 balls. Skipper Rohit Sharma was bowled for an eight-ball duck when Rabada broke through his defence in the third over. Shubman Gill played some attractive shots but was bowled playing across the line against Burger, out for 26 off 37 balls. Gill had added 39 runs with Kohli for the third wicket. Even so, it wasn't a comfortable partnership and India went to tea at 62-3. The procession of wickets continued straight after play resumed as Jansen bowled Shreyas Iyer for six, again playing across the line. Burger then made quick work of the lower order. First innings' centurion Lokesh Rahul was caught at second slip. Ravichandran Ashwin hung out his bat on the first ball he faced - caught at gully for a golden duck. Kohli played some attractive strokes towards the end, and reached 50 off 61 balls. Overall he hit 12 fours and a six, but was unable to complete his century, out caught off Jansen. India was bowled out in just 34.1 overs across less than two sessions in a hapless batting display. This was after South Africa added only 16 runs to its first innings post lunch. Skipper Temba Bavuma did not bat owing to his hamstring injury. Jansen was stranded at 84 not out with Jasprit Bumrah wrapping up the tail with two quick wickets. The pacer finished with 4-69 in an otherwise uninspiring Indian bowling display.","innings, burger, runs, centurion, first, nandre, bavuma, temba, display, ravichandran, ashwin, pacer, balls, test, duck, elgar, yashaswi, ball, rohit, skipper"

After restricting the South Africans to 212, Australia eked its way to 215-7 to win with 16 balls to spare in a tense atmosphere inside Eden Gardens. Australia will be bidding to win the 50-over World Cup for a record-extending sixth time, while host nation India is seeking a third title. The championship match is in Ahmedabad on Sunday. South Africa has never won a semifinal match at the World Cup in five attempts. Australia has only lost once in nine World Cup semifinals. Reaching the final at this edition marked a stunning turnaround for the five-time champions after losing their first two matches in the group stage. It went on to lift the trophy after beating South Africa in both 1999 and 2007 but faces a formidable test on Sunday against India which has won its 10 matches at this edition. Travis Head scored 62 off 48 balls to give Australia's chase a fast start. South Africa refused to give up and reduced Australia to 137-5 in the 24th over with the valuable wicket of Glenn Maxwell for just 1. Steve Smith registered a cautious 30 runs off 62 balls before he was dismissed to make it 174-6 in the 34th over. Australia kept its nerve and crossed the finish line in the 48th over. Mitchell Starc's 16 not out off 38 balls and skipper Pat Cummins's 14 off 29 saw their team into the final for a record eighth time.","cup, world, balls, cricket, kohli, africans, eden, thriller, trophy, the, gardens, 34th, maxwell, nerve, matches, 24th, australia, kolkata, turnaround, atmosphere"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/pakistan-beats-sri-lanka-in-a-record-run-chase-at-cricket-world-cup,Pakistan beats Sri Lanka in a record run-chase at Cricket World Cup,Associated Press,2023-10-10 23:32:35,"HDYERABAD, OCTOBER 10 Mohammad Rizwan and opening batter Abdullah Shafique hit centuries Tuesday as Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in a record run-chase at the Cricket World Cup. Chasing a target of 345, Rizwan played with a pulled right calf and scored an unbeaten 131 off 121 balls. Shafique, replacing out-of-form Fakhar Zaman, scored 113 to help Pakistan reach 345-4 in 48.2 overs. Pakistan stretched its World Cup record against Sri Lanka to 8-0 as has four points from two victories. Pakistan have beaten both the qualifiers - the Netherlands and Sri Lanka - going into the marquee game against rival India in Ahmedabad on Saturday. ""Always proud when you perform like that,"" Rizwan said after a knock which featured eight fours and three sixes. ""It was difficult and when you chase like that, it's always special. Every player in the dressing room had the belief we can chase that."" Sri Lanka has had plenty of bowling problems at the World Cup in the absence of injured star legspinner Wanindu Hasaranga. The team also lost its opening game against South Africa, which scored 428 runs against the Sri Lankans. Pakistan's big chase surpassed Ireland's previous Cricket World Cup record when it made 329-7 to beat England in 2011. The hundreds from Shafique, who hit 10 fours and three sixes, and Rizwan overshadowed Kusal Mendis' 77-ball 122 and Sadeera Samarawickrama's 108 - maiden ODI hundreds that pushed Sri Lanka's total to 344-9 on a day when bowlers got walloped from both sides on a perfect batting pitch. Mendis and Samarawickrama showed plenty of aggression in the middle overs with a 111-run third-wicket stand off 69 balls, hitting 25 fours and eight sixes in between them. Mendis capitalized on two early dropped catches inside the powerplay when first off-color Shaheen Afridi (1-66) couldn't hold onto a sharp return catch and Imam-ul-Haq dropped a sharp chance at point. Mendis hit 14 fours and six sixes, including a flicked six over midwicket against Pakistan's best bowler of the day - Hasan Ali (4-71) - that brought up his century off 65 balls. Samarawickrama took charge after Mendis holed out to a well-judged catch by Imam at mid-wicket fence. Pakistan pulled back in the final 10 overs despite Samrawickrama raising his century with Haris Rauf (2-64) picking up both his wickets in the final over. ""We should've finished stronger in the end,"" Sri Lanka captain Shanaka said. ""The way the wicket behaved, we were 20-25 runs short. ... I can't ask too much from the bowlers."" Pakistan had a sluggish start to the chase when Dilshan Madushanka got the key wickets in the powerplay as Imam pulled to fine leg and captain Babar Azam (10) edged a leg side flick to the wicketkeeper. Shafique and Rizwan then began Pakistan's second highest ever run-chase in an ODI as Sri Lankan bowlers like Matheesha Pathirana sprayed plenty of wayward deliveries with his slingy action to end up with 1-90. In the earlier game in Dharamsala, Dawid Malan's century set up England's first win when it beat Bangladesh by 137 runs. Malan scored 140 off 107 balls - his fifth ODI hundred - as England reached 364-9 to bounce back from losing to New Zealand in the tournament opener. Left-arm pacer Reece Topley returned figures of 4-43 as England bowled out Bangladesh for 227 in 48.2 overs. It was England's fourth biggest win by runs in World Cup history. Put in to bat, England made a strong start as Malan and Jonny Bairstow (52) shared 115 runs for the first wicket. Shakib Al Hasan bowled Bairstow, but Malan and Joe Root added 151 runs for the second wicket. Malan hit 16 fours and five sixes overall, and reached his hundred off 91 balls. After the landmark, he cut loose to score 40 off only 16 balls, hitting four fours and three sixes. ""It was fantastic to put in a performance like this and win a game (for the team). Hopefully my form will continue ahead,"" Malan said. ""With Root at three, it allows us to play freely. I am desperate to do well in this format and prove a point."" Root also scored quickly, reaching 50 off 44 balls. Overall, he hit 82 off 68 balls, including eight fours and a six, as he continues to rediscover his form. England lost its way a bit in the last phase of the innings. After Malan's dismissal, the English went from 296-2 to 307-5, losing Root and Jos Buttler (20). Liam Livingstone, who has a good IPL record at the stadium, was bowled for a golden duck. Harry Brook (20) guided the score past 350 along with the lower middle-order. Topley then destroyed Bangladesh's chase with the new ball. He sent back Tanzid Hasan for one, and then Najmul Hossain Shanto was caught for a golden duck in the second over. Four overs later, Topley bowled Shakib for one. Chris Woakes had Mehidy Hasan Miraz caught behind for eight as Bangladesh struggled at 49-4 in 8.3 overs. The game was effectively already over, even as Litton Das top-scored with 76 to help stabilize the innings. He put on 72 runs with Mushfiqur Rahim, the only time Bangladesh looked comfortable. Rahim scored 51 runs, but there weren't any lower-order heroics to jeopardize England's win. England and Bangladesh, which beat Afghanistan in its opener, both have two points after two games.","balls, the, sri, cup, fours, odi, runs, chase, malan, hasan, world, overs, wicket, topley, lanka, dawid, reece, game, off, sadeera"

Sharma smashed 12 fours and four sixes on his way to the fastest century for an Indian batsman in a World Cup game, finishing on 131. He added 156 runs off 112 balls with Ishan Kishan as India steamrolled its way to 273-2. Earlier, Hashmatullah Shahidi and Azmatullah Omarzai put on a 121-run partnership, the second highest ever in the World Cup for Afghanistan, as it finished on 272-8. Sharma broke a plethora of records on the day as India joined New Zealand and Pakistan on two wins from two games. ""It was a good win for us, as it is important to get momentum going at the start of such a tournament,"" Sharma said. ""It was a good pitch to bat and I just backed myself to play my natural game. It is my job to set the start in run-chases, and I look to put the opposition under pressure. It is a special feeling to get another World Cup hundred."" It was Sharma's seventh World Cup hundred - the most by an Indian batsman - and his 31st in ODIs. He is now third on the list of all-time ODI hundreds, after compatriots Sachin Tendulkar (49) and Virat Kohli (47). Kishan scored 47 runs off 47 balls, with five fours and two sixes. Kohli rounded up India's night with 55 not out off 56 balls, including six fours, at his home ground. Chasing 273, Sharma and Kishan set a hectic pace as they smacked 50 off 37 balls. The next 50 came off only 34 balls. Sharma got to 50 off 30 balls, the second quickest in this World Cup, as he hit seven fours and two sixes. He then hit five more fours and two more sixes to score his second 50 off 33 balls. His third six took him past Chris Gayle's tally of 553 for the most sixes in international cricket. Kishan was out caught in the 19th over, against the run of play. Kohli then walked out to bat at his home ground with the capacity crowd at the Arun Jaitely Stadium chanting his name. Sharma continued attacking the bowlers, scoring 29 off the next 19 balls, and added 49 off 42 balls with Kohli for the second wicket. He was bowled off Rashid Khan, trying to hit a googly out of the ground. Kohli was joined in by Shreyas Iyer, who scored 25 not out and hit a 101-meter six. They added 68 off 56 balls for the third wicket, as India wrapped up the win with 90 balls to spare. Earlier, Afghanistan made a cautious start after it won the toss and opted to bat. Rahmanullah Gurbaz (21) and Ibrahim Zadran (22) added 32 runs for the first wicket as the Indian pacers searched for their bearings on a flat track. Mohammed Siraj proved expensive - he finished with 0-76 from nine overs, his joint most expensive spell in ODIs after returning the same figures against Australia on debut in 2019. Bumrah got the breakthrough to dismiss Zadran, while Gurbaz holed out at square leg off Hardik Pandya. Shardul Thakur, who was brought in for Ravichandran Ashwin, trapped Rahmat Shah lbw for 16. It brought Shahidi and Azmatullah together, and they defied India's bowlers for 128 deliveries. Their 100-run partnership came off 118 balls. Shahidi scored 80 off 88 balls, including eight fours and a six, with his half-century coming off 58 deliveries. It was his third 50-plus score in World Cups, the most for an Afghanistan batsman. Azmatullah also scored 50 off 62 balls, and overall scored 62 off 69 balls. He hit two fours and four sixes. Wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav bowled with great control, taking 1-40 in 10 overs. Pandya finished with 2-43 from seven overs, while Bumrah was India's most successful bowler with 4-39. Pandya got the breakthrough when he bowled Azmatullah in the 35th over, while Yadav trapped Shahidi lbw in the 43rd. Afghanistan lost its last four wickets for 36 runs, with Bumrah dismissing hard-hitters Mohammad Nabi (19) and Rashid Khan (16), but finished with its second-highest World Cup total. India's next game is against archrival Pakistan in Ahmedabad on Saturday. ""It will be crucial for us to not think too much about external factors and just look at things we can control,"" Sharma said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/cricket-world-cup-picks-up-where-it-left-off-with-england-against-new-zealand,"Cricket World Cup picks up where it left off, with England against New Zealand",Associated Press,2023-10-04 20:15:31,"AHMEDABAD, OCTOBER 4 After combining to produce the most dramatic finish ever to a Cricket World Cup, England and New Zealand will meet again this time to open the 2023 edition in India. England was awarded its first title four years ago at Lord's on a contentious countback against the New Zealanders after the final finished tied and a so-called Super Over also failed to separate the teams. The tiebreaker was a heavily derided and subsequently dumped countback of boundaries, giving England the narrowest of victories as it hosted the pinnacle competition in cricket's one-day format for the fifth time. The defending champions and runners-up will get the six-week tournament started Thursday at the 134,000-seater Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. This same venue will host the highly anticipated India-Pakistan showdown on Oct. 14 and the final on Nov. 19. Top-ranked England arrived in India aiming to be just the third team - following West Indies (1975 and '79) and Australia (1999, 2003 and '07) - to win back-to- back ODI World Cups. Jos Buttler has taken over from 2019 skipper Eoin Morgan, but England's attacking approach – high risk, high reward – remains the same. Ben Stokes returned from his short-lived ODI retirement to rejoin the likes of Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran, Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes – all players who can play multiple rules, thus allowing the batting to run deep. England is coming off a series win over New Zealand at home last month, and a four-wicket win over Bangladesh in an unofficial warmup at Guwahati on Monday. ""We had a valuable outing in terms of bowlers getting to bowl and some batters getting time in the middle,"" Ali said after the win over Bangladesh. ""We are ready. It's going to be a massive game (against New Zealand) ... They're a dangerous side."" Stokes is back as a specialist batter. Slotting in at No. 4, Stokes scored 182 from 124 balls in the series-clinching third game against New Zealand last month at The Oval, where England won by a thumping 181 runs. Stokes was the key player in England's victory in the 2019 final and his return to ODI duty only bolsters his team's chances of back-to-back titles. However, he is not certain to play against New Zealand because of a sore hip. Buttler, speaking ahead of his side's final training session, said: ""He's got a slight niggle with his hip, but fingers crossed that it'll be good news for us. We'll see."" England is spoilt for choices in terms of batting power, with Harry Brook's chances of breaking into the starting XI linked to Joe Root's form. The veteran Root has been a long-term leader in the England lineup but has posted only one half-century in his last nine ODI innings. In its last ODI outing in India, back in March 2021, England lost a three-match series 2-1. It posted totals of 251, 337-4 and 322-9 in those three games at Pune, and Buttler's lineup will be aiming to replicate those last two scores on a regular basis in this tournament. For New Zealand, this tournament presents a chance to go one step further, without worrying about the boundary countback. A simpler rule has replaced it: this time tied finalists will keep contesting Super Overs until there is a clear winner. But it's too early for the Black Caps to be thinking about that, particularly after a run of injuries. Veteran pace bowler Tim Southee's thumb injury is likely to keep him on the sidelines until later in the tournament. Kane Williamson, who scored 54 and 37 in the two warmup games, also won't play the opener against England because he needs more time to recover from a long-term knee injury. ""I'm really fortunate to be a part of this World Cup. Five months ago, that didn't seem a possibility,"" he said after New Zealand's warmup win over Pakistan. ""There is still some time to go (to full fitness), and it is great to get through some batting in the middle."" Tom Latham will lead the Black Caps in Williamson's absence which, in turn, will allow both Glenn Phillips and Mark Chapman to feature in the game. The middle-order duo has become a vital cog for New Zealand in ODI cricket over the last two years, as they make good use of the last 20 overs with some impressive power hitting. New Zealand also has Devon Conway to share Williamson's run-scoring burden. The 32-year-old left-handed opener made his ODI debut in 2021 and averages 46 in 22 matches since. Conway also has extensive experience of Indian conditions, given he is a vital batsman for the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings. New Zealand is also well rounded in the bowling department, with spinners Ish Sodhi and Mitchell Santner expected to perform will in the conditions. Left-arm pacer Trent Boult is part of the mix, despite relinquishing his full national contract, and it is surely to be his last World Cup for the Black Caps. Since 2015, New Zealand has qualified for the semifinals of every ICC white-ball tournament, and reaching the last four would again be a minimum expectation for its golden generation of cricketers.","odi, the, warmup, cricket, super, zealand, williamson, countback, sodhi, ish, world, cup, his, eoin, tournament, morgan, outing, root, england, buttler"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/marsh-set-to-return-to-the-top-of-the-order-for-australia-at-the-cricket-world-cup-in-india,Marsh set to return to the top of the order for Australia at the Cricket World Cup in India,Associated Press,2023-09-29 19:54:45,"BRISBANE, SEPTEMBER 29 A month ago Mitch Marsh thought he may have to return down the order to create room for others in Australia's preferred starting lineup at the Cricket World Cup despite his recent success batting at the top of the innings. The man who once joked that everyone in Australia hated him because he hadn't made the most of his chances at international level now appears to be the go-to option as an opener. With Travis Head expected to miss at least the first half of the Oct. 5-Nov. 19 World Cup because of a fractured right hand, and with Steve Smith returning from injury to bat at No. 3, the best direction for Marsh to go is up. And if the big, burly allrounder can form an opening partnership with veteran David Warner like he did with Head in Australia's series win in India in March, it gives the five-time champions serious firepower to start their innings. Australia captain Pat Cummins all but confirmed the two would open to start the World Cup following his side's 66-run consolation win over India in the final game of a three-game series this week. India won the first two matches. ""Potentially Trav Head won't be ready for the start of the tournament,"" Cummins said when asked who might open the batting in Australia's first match against India on Oct. 8. ""But I think the way him (Marsh) and Davey (Warner) started today, it looks like a pretty dangerous combination."" Marsh's 84-ball 96 in the third match with three sixes and 13 fours had earlier helped Australia rectify its batting issues and fellow opener Warner (56 in 34) also scored his third successive half-century. A recent white-ball tour to South Africa, where Marsh led an injury-depleted team to a Twenty20 series sweep and a 2-0 lead in the ODI format before losing three consecutive one-dayers, hasn't dented his confidence. ""I certainly thought we started the series well. Played some really good cricket, go back to the T20 series we played some really good cricket as well,"" Marsh said. ""There's plenty of positives to take."" The Australians had a lot of experience to recall ahead of losing the first two matches - and the three-match series - against India, with Cummins, strike left-arm paceman Mitchell Starc, former skipper Smith and allrounder Glenn Maxwell returning from injuries. Coach Andrew McDonald said Marsh ""did an incredible job"" covering for Cummins and without so many regular starters. ""We had a lot of moving parts - multiple changes each game with some injuries and making sure we're prepped as well as we can be for the World Cup,"" McDonald said. Marsh will be relying for success again on his uncomplicated approach to batting in all forms of cricket. That is: see the ball, hit the ball - a long, long way. It's been working so far in his career resurgence, which gained traction with his player of the final performance when he batted at No. 3 in Australia's first ever Twenty20 World Cup title in 2021. It worked again in his recall to test cricket in July after four years when he posted a run-a-ball 118 - batting at a conventional No. 6 - during the Ashes in England. And it worked for him the last time Australia was playing white-ball cricket in India, where he averaged 97 at a strike rate well over 125 and hit a dozen sixes across three innings in his experimental rise from the middle order to replace the retired opener Aaron Finch. Marsh was voted player of the series when Australia rallied for that 2-1 victory, scoring 81 from 65 balls, an unbeaten 66 off 36 deliveries and a run-a-ball 47. Warner missed the first two games of that earlier series and, when he returned for the deciding third game, he was forced to bat below Marsh because selectors didn't want to break the team's momentum. Marsh has earned himself another chance to shine after a lengthy career that started with promise in 2011 for the son of Geoff Marsh - who won the 1987 World Cup in India as a player and the 1999 World Cup in England as a coach - but threatened to derail because of injuries and inconsistency. His only three World Cup games have netted 31 runs and five wickets - all five wickets and 23 runs on debut against England in 2015, when Australia won the title on home soil. After his winning hand in Australia's T20 title two years ago, a 2019 video of Marsh's candid comments about his on-again, off-again status with the national team's supporters went viral. Since then, the reception has been mostly good. With Australia likely to rely heavily on allrounders and rotate fast bowlers like Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Sean Abbott in the sub-continental conditions, Marnus Labuschagne will help bolster the struggling middle-order. Labuschagne was added to the squad late this week when team officials said Ashton Agar had not recovered from a calf injury. Head was also confirmed in the final 15-man squad at the same time. ""He's made a significant shift in intent at the crease,"" McDonald said after the series in South Africa, where Labuschagne was recalled amid a string on injuries to other players. ""We know Marnus is a quality player. He's come in and he's taken that opportunity.""","the, cup, warner, his, australia, world, series, marsh, batting, three, mcdonald, cricket, oct, allrounder, maxwell, ball, andrew, first, game, nov"

India last won the 50-overs World Cup when it co-hosted the event in 2011 with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. M.S. Dhoni went on to lift the trophy as India beat Lanka by six wickets in the final at Mumbai. It was India's second ODI World Cup title - Kapil Dev's team had the first when the side registered an upset triumph in England in 1983. In 2013, India beat hosts England in the Champions Trophy final. Since then, it has been a veritable trophy drought - India lost in the semifinals of both the 2015 and 2019 ODI World Cups, while finishing runners-up in the 2014 T20 World Cup and the 2017 Champions Trophy. India also hosted the 2016 T20 World Cup but failed to reach the finals, losing to eventual champions West Indies in the semifinal at Mumbai. It also lost successive World Test Championship finals to New Zealand (2021) and Australia (2023). Despite a lack of success, India continues to be a perennial favorite at any and every ICC event. The expectations are enhanced when it hosts an ICC event, and so India - under Rohit Sharma - will be among the favorites when New Zealand plays England on Oct. 5 in the opening match in a replay of last year's final won by England. For 36-year-old Sharma, it has been a bit of redemption. Left out of India's 2011 World Cup-winning squad because of form and fitness concerns, he is now both captain and a prominent batter. Sharma joins a select group of Indian captains to have led in a home World Cup - Kapil Dev (1987), Mohammed Azharuddin (1996) and Dhoni (2011, 2016). Sharma finished as the top-scorer in the 2019 World Cup with 648 runs in nine matches at average 81. In 2015, he was India's second-highest run-scorer in the tournament, so a lot will rest on Sharma's run-scoring ability and his opening partnership with highly rated youngster Shubman Gill, who has scored 1,052 runs in 18 ODI innings in 2023. There is also Virat Kohli, who recently overcame a prolonged three-year run of poor form and scored three centuries in his last 13 ODI innings. He now has 47 ODI centuries, two behind compatriot Sachin Tendulkar's all-time record of 49, and the star batsman is expected to break that record during the tournament. India experienced patchy form in its run-up to the World Cup. It barely managed to beat West Indies 2-1 (away) with Sharma and Kohli rested for the majority of that three-match series. Earlier, in March, it lost 2-1 at home to a full-strength Australian side. But India is coming off a 2-1 win over Australia in India in the past week, including Australia's consolation 66-run win on Wednesday. Key players include pacer Jasprit Bumrah, wicketkeeper Lokesh Rahul and middle-order batsman Shreyas Iyer, who recovered from long-term injuries to spur India to win its eighth Asia Cup title earlier this month. It beat Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the group stages, before steamrolling Sri Lanka in the final. Pacer Mohammed Siraj picked a career-best 6-21 in Colombo as Sri Lanka was bowled out for just 50 runs. India will open its tournament campaign against five-time champions Australia on Oct. 8 in Chennai. It will take on archrivals Pakistan in the marquee World Cup clash on Oct. 14 at Ahmedabad and will face England on Oct. 29 in Lucknow. ""In the last few games (against Australia and at the Asia Cup), we have been challenged across different conditions and against different opposition,"" Sharma said after the third ODI against Australia on Wednesday. ""We have played really well in these games. We have a good squad and we understand how we want to use it during the World Cup. It will be about keeping our minds and bodies fresh across the next 1 1/2 months.""","cup, world, odi, trophy, kapil, the, dev, champions, oct, year, drought, pacer, run, mohammed, sachin, tendulkar, lokesh, icc, event, t20"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/england-looks-to-back-up-its-status-as-white-ball-kings-in-defense-of-the-cricket-world-cup,England looks to back up its status as white-ball kings in defense of the Cricket World Cup,Associated Press,2023-09-28 13:22:19,"England has a big target on its back heading into the Cricket World Cup. As the defending world champions in both the 50-over and Twenty20 formats, the English are the kings of white-ball cricket and, in theory, the team to beat over the next couple of months - even if India, South Africa and Australia, in particular, might have something to say about that. There's plenty going for England, too. Eight of the 2019 World Cup-winning squad are back again seeking to defend the title and that experience can be crucial in those tight games which can be a battle of nerves as much as anything else. Among them is Ben Stokes, who came out of ODI retirement last month and has already underlined his enduring value by hitting a 182 - the highest individual score by English player in the format - in the recent series against New Zealand. In Jos Buttler, the team has a smart captain who seamlessly replaced the retired Eoin Morgan in the role and hasn't yet allowed the position to affect his form. Buttler remains one of the world's most destructive white-ball batters. England isn't short of them, either. There's Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Liam Livingstone and Harry Brook, along with more nimble batters like Dawid Malan and Joe Root. The batting goes deep, too, in the form of Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes and Sam Curran. Beating New Zealand 3-1 in what ultimately was a dominant series victory was an encouraging way to prepare for the World Cup, even if it was in conditions vastly different to what England will face on the subcontinent. There are some nagging concerns, however. England's ODI side is nowhere near as settled as it was in 2019. There have been some issues regarding who will open the batting alongside Bairstow, now that Jason Roy - an ODI stalwart - was axed at the last minute to accommodate Brook. It will be Malan to start with and Brook is another option, though neither regularly open the batting. Brook, a batter who will likely be in England teams in all formats for years to come, belatedly earned the faith of selectors despite scoring just 37 runs in three innings against New Zealand. Root struggled just as much, hitting only 39 runs in four innings and lacks rhythm in the 50-over game having played just 16 ODIs since the 2019 World Cup. England's bowling might be questioned, too, with the X-factor of Jofra Archer not around and fellow pacer Mark Wood's fitness remaining suspect given he didn't even play one match in the New Zealand series and hasn't had any competitive cricket since the Ashes. Spinner Adil Rashid, meanwhile, missed the final three matches against the Black Caps because a calf injury. Before New Zealand, the English had only won one of their five previous ODI series - and that was against Bangladesh. There are series losses in there against India, Australia and South Africa, potentially England's biggest rivals at the World Cup. Still, England's white-ball teams have an aura about them these days and their deep batting stocks mean they are rarely going to be completely out of games. They have big players who are used to the big stage and to seizing the moment when it comes. It would be a big surprise if England doesn't reach the semifinals, even if successfully defending the title on the subcontinent might be regarded as a bigger achievement than winning it for the first time four years ago on that unforgettable day at Lord's.","the, england, world, odi, cup, cricket, series, eoin, adil, morgan, ball, batting, rashid, kings, white, formats, wood, big, batters, stalwart"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/environment/season-opening-wins-for-hyderabad-and-chennai-in-ipl,Season-opening wins for Hyderabad and Chennai in IPL,Associated Press,2025-03-24 13:27:47,"HYDERABAD, MARCH 24 Ishan Kishan scored 106 not out off 47 balls as Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Rajasthan Royals by 44 runs in their season-opening encounter in the 2025 Indian Premier League on Sunday. Kishan smacked 11 fours and six sixes in his first IPL hundred on debut for his new franchise, which notched up its second-highest total in tournament history. Travis Head scored 67 off 31 balls as the Sunrisers picked up where they left off in 2024 to reach a mammoth 286-6 in 20 overs. Hyderabad's previous highest score was 287-3 - the highest IPL total - against Royal Challengers Bengaluru last season. In the evening game, Chennai Super Kings beat Mumbai Indians by four wickets with five balls remaining in a high-profile clash. Afghanistan's left-arm wrist spinner Noor Ahmad took 4-18 in four overs for Chennai as Mumbai was restricted to 155-9 after losing the toss. Tilak Varma top-scored with 31 off 25 balls. Rachin Ravindra's unbeaten 65 off 45 balls, along with skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad's quick-fire 53 off 26, helped Chennai score 158-6 in 19.1 overs. Royals fall short despite reaching 242-6 Rajasthan Royals fought well to post 242-6 (20 overs) in reply to Hyderabad's huge target. Dhruv Jurel led with 70 off 35 balls, while Sanju Samson scored 66 off 37 balls. Put into bat, Hyderabad ran away at the start with Head and Abhishek Sharma's (24) explosive opening pairing putting on 45 off 19 balls. Kishan found another gear as he reached 50 off 25 balls. Hyderabad, which bought him at the season's auction earlier, found immediate returns as the young batter smacked his way to an attacking hundred on debut for his new franchise. He put on 85 off 39 balls with Head, who also hit nine fours and three sixes. The latter fell just prior to the halfway mark. Kishan – and Hyderabad – did not let up the scoring rate. He found able company in Nitish Reddy who hit 30 off 15 balls and Heinrich Klaasen, who added 34 off 14 balls. Kishan's next 50 came off 22 balls, as he raced to his century, helping Hyderabad to a statement total in its first outing. Rough day for Rajasthan's English pacer Jofra Archer England pacer Jofra Archer finished with 0-76 from four overs – the most expensive spell in IPL history. Rajasthan faltered early in its chase. Yashasvi Jaiswal was out caught for one, while Riyan Parag was dismissed for four - both in the second over. It became 50-3 as Nitish Rana was dismissed for 11. Samson, coming in as an impact substitute, did start off the season in style. He scored 50 off 26 balls, and put on 111 off 60 balls with Jurel as Rajasthan fought back on a good batting surface. Jurel reached 50 off 28 balls at the other end, hitting six sixes and five fours as the chase revolved around him. Adam Zampa dismissed him in the 15th over, while Samson was out caught in the previous over. It was too tall an ask for Rajasthan thereafter to chase down the mammoth target successfully despite fruitful cameos from Shimron Hetmyer (42 off 23 balls) and Shubham Dubey (34 not out off 11 balls). Mumbai's spin woes in Chennai Ahmad sprung into action after left-arm pacer Khaleel Ahmed took 3-29, including the dismissal of Rohit Sharma for a four-ball duck. Spin did the trick on a slow Chepauk track as Mumbai never got into third gear in its opening game. It missed skipper Hardik Pandya, who was on the bench serving a slow over-rate suspension from 2024. Stand-in skipper Suryakumar Yadav managed 29 off 26 balls, falling to Ahmad and a stumping by India great MS Dhoni, who returned to the IPL for Chennai at the age of 43. Mumbai was down to 96-6 in 13 overs and then 118-7 in 16.1 overs. Deepak Chahar, a former Chennai player making his Mumbai debut, scored 28 not out off 15 balls including two sixes to push the score past 150. Chasing 156, Chennai was boosted by a 67-run partnership for the second wicket off only 37 balls between Gaikwad and Ravindra. Gaikwad hit three sixes and six fours, reaching 50 off 22 balls. Mumbai struck back through 24-year-old left-arm wrist spinner Vignesh Puthur (3-32). Chennai lost regular wickets to Puthur and Will Jacks but Ravindra helped his team reach the target in the 20th over. Dhoni was 0 not out and faced only two balls.","balls, off, hyderabad, ipl, archer, jofra, overs, puthur, rajasthan, the, ahmad, season, chennai, mumbai, 50, fours, pacer, gaikwad, ruturaj, jacks"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/no-turning-back-a-pivotal-moment-for-women-and-girls-in-asia-pacific,No turning back: A pivotal moment for women and girls in Asia-Pacific,Pio Smith,2025-03-07 12:39:58,"Thirty years ago, the world made a promise: gender equality for all. The Beijing Declaration set an ambitious agenda, urging governments to accelerate progress. Nowhere was this more crucial than in the Asia-Pacific region, home to over half the world's women and girls. Decades of advocacy and investment led to tangible gains – more women in leadership, stronger legal protections and improved access to healthcare and education. But today, those hard-won gains are unravelling. Gender equality is not just stalling – it is reversing. Reproductive rights are rolling back. Gender-based violence is rising. Women's political representation is stagnating and, in some cases, regressing. Economic instability, conflict, and climate disasters are deepening inequalities, pushing women and girls into greater vulnerability. Asia and the Pacific stands at a crossroads. Do we drive forward to ensure equality and opportunity for all women and girls? Or do we allow decades of hard-won progress to slip away? The direction we choose now will steer the future of generations. Maternal mortality, once declining, has stagnated. In some countries, fewer than 30 percent of women have access to contraception. In the Pacific, one in two women has experienced intimate partner violence. Climate change is exacerbating inequalities, uprooting families, and exposing women to exploitation and abuse. Women and children in the region are 14 times more likely to die in disasters. In Afghanistan, a woman dies from preventable pregnancy complications every two hours, making it one of the deadliest countries in the world to give birth. Less than one in four sexually active unmarried youth in the region uses contraception, leaving many vulnerable to unintended pregnancies, early marriage, and limited life choices. Take Maya, a 16-year-old girl in rural Nepal. She dreams of becoming a doctor but her future is slipping away. Forced to leave school to help at home and pressured into an early marriage, her choices are stolen. Maya's story reflects the reality of millions of girls across the region, where poverty, discrimination, and harmful norms rob them of opportunities. South Asia is home to around 290 million child brides - 45 per cent of the global total. For girls like Maya, the promise of Beijing remains unfulfilled. With a rapidly ageing population in Asia-Pacific, older women-many of whom spent their lives caring for others without financial security-face heightened risks of poverty, neglect, and abuse. A gender-equal future must ensure dignity, security, and healthcare for women at every stage of life. As we approach the 68th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, the stakes could not be higher. This year's theme-accelerating gender equality by addressing poverty and strengthening institutions and financing-demands action. In Asia-Pacific, where deep inequalities persist, governments must match political will with sustainable, strategic funding to drive real change. Governments must prioritize universal access to sexual and reproductive health services. Every woman and girl deserves the right to make informed choices about her body and her future. No woman should die giving life - preventable maternal deaths must end. We must enforce stronger laws and build support systems to end gender-based violence. This means enforcing legislation, providing survivor-centred services and addressing harmful norms that enable violence. We must actively promote women's leadership in politics and decision-making. The Pacific has some of the lowest rates of women's political representation in the world. In Fiji, for example, women's representation in parliament dropped from almost 20 per cent to just over 10 percent in the last election. Addressing these gaps is not only about fairness and equity - it's about building stronger, more inclusive societies. The economic case for gender equality is clear. Closing gender gaps in employment would boost GDP by up to 20 percent globally. Investing in midwives alone would prevent 40 percent of maternal and newborn deaths, saving 4.3 million lives by 2035. Countries that invest in gender equality see stronger economies, healthier populations, and greater resilience in the face of crises. Yet, despite overwhelming evidence, funding for women's health and rights remains woefully inadequate. This is not just a policy failure - it is a human rights failure. With only five years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 5 on gender equality, we need to get back on track. If we continue at the current pace, it will take centuries to close the gender gap. Rights can be lost as quickly as they are gained. Progress is not inevitable; however, hope is not lost either. History reassures us that when a woman is given the opportunity to thrive, she does not just transform her own life - she sparks change for her community and her entire nation. At a time when politics and disinformation threaten the rights of women and girls - we must not falter. This International Women's Day, we must recommit to the promise we made 30 years ago - for Maya, for the millions still denied their rights, for future generations. The future we want - where every woman and girl can live free from violence, make her own choices, and access opportunities - truly is within reach. But only if we refuse to step back. Only if we push forward, together. The time is now. Let's ensure we are on the right side of history.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/happysaturdays-for-children-leadership-program-for-woman-leave-impact,Leadership and Healing: A year of growth for women and children,Tht Online,2025-02-05 14:02:05,"KATHMANDU: For 13-year-old Siddhartha Ghimire, weekends were supposed to be a break from the pressures of school, family expectations, and personal aspirations. But when his mother enrolled him in a seemingly ""weird"" meditation and leadership program called HappySaturdays, he was far from thrilled. ""I didn't want to join anything labeled 'child-friendly' or 'self-improvement.' It felt like another responsibility,"" said Siddhartha, a 9th grader at GEMS School. ""But after attending a few sessions, I started to enjoy it."" Engaging debates, soulful music and meditation, and insightful discussions on current affairs-topics rarely explored in the rigid structure of a school classroom-captured his interest. ""We talked about the mind, the universe, our city, governance, and development. Even meditation, which I thought would be boring, felt important because everyone, including the mentors, participated genuinely,"" he shared. A Mother's Concern Sparked the Movement The story behind HappySaturdays is as unique as its impact. The program was not initially planned for children at all. It was the determination of a single mother, Perina Bhandari (name changed), that led to the initiative. Bhandari was struggling to help her teenage son, who was suffering from sleepless nights and anxiety due to unresolved domestic issues. She was looking for something beyond conventional counseling-a space where her child could heal and grow. When she enrolled in weekly Leadership and Inner Well-being sessions organized by Gargi Media House and Mandala Bihani-a dynamic network of youth leaders and activists at KnK College of Baneshwor-she learned about HappyMe, a healing art therapy program. This piqued her curiosity. ""I had never heard of Gargi Media House or anything like the HappyMe program,"" Bhandari said. ""But when I found out it focused on inner well-being and spirituality, I knew it was exactly what my son needed. When they told me it wasn't designed for kids, I asked-why not?"" Her persistence convinced journalist and trainer Anjali Subedi, Managing Director of Gargi Media House, to modify HappyMe-a healing art therapy program for adults-into HappySaturdays, a space for children's well-being. With the support of KnK College, which provided a free venue, and fellow mentors Anita Sunar, Praveen Yadav, and Mina Panday, the program took off. At first, HappySaturdays attracted only a handful of children from Baneshwor, mostly through word-of-mouth promotion by Bhandari. However, as the impact became evident, more children started joining. Over time, the program evolved beyond meditation and healing. It introduced children to leadership skills such as public speaking, debate, interview techniques, and even creative arts like singing, dancing, and drama. ""For the first time, I felt seen and appreciated,"" said 8-year-old Eric, whose mother, Karuna Shrestha, noticed a remarkable change in him. ""He lacked confidence before, but at HappySaturdays, he won prizes-something that had never happened at school. It changed him completely."" Parallel Paths: Women's Empowerment through Leadership While children found a safe space in HappySaturdays, women were also finding their voices in another wing of the initiative. A year-long Leadership and Inner Well-being program ran alongside HappySaturdays, providing professional and personal development opportunities for women. Sessions for children would run from 11 to 1pm and women would take over for the next two hours every Saturday. ""This program broadened my perspective and made me more confident, both as a journalist and as an individual,"" said Samjhana BK, a Kathmandu-based journalist. The sessions covered self-help strategies, public speaking, digital literacy, and the media's evolving role in tackling misinformation. Binita Rijal, a video journalist at Nepal Television, initially struggled with stage fright. ""By the third week, I was at ease. I realized confidence is just about practice,"" she said. Even women from political backgrounds, like Sabitra Dura and Mamata Samyabadi of the Nepal Communist Party (Biplab), found the program beneficial. ""The English-speaking sessions were especially useful. Opportunities to practice spoken English aren't easily available,"" Dura noted. For Mamata, storytelling practices were the most valuable. According to the program's designer and mentor, Subedi, her long career in journalism, particularly her experience with the Asia Journalism Fellowship as well as her inclination to healing therapy, mediation and spirituality, inspired her to bring women together to share and learn. ""We focused mainly on open discussions and debates on current issues, English speaking, presentations, and inner well-being or healing exercises,"" she said. By the time the year-long program concluded in January 2025, HappySaturdays had helped 22 children from both private and community schools, while the women's program had empowered 25 participants from various professional fields. Meanwhile, Dr. Resh Bahadur Basnet, Founder and Principal of KnK College, expressed his pleasure in supporting the program. ""In today's stressful times, we all need positive spaces. Seeing children and women grow in confidence and self-awareness is truly rewarding,"" he said.","program, leadership, sessions, mother, inner, healing, well, her, speaking, being, the, therapy, year, resh, happyme, anjali, women, meditation, mentors, self"

Prince Edward paid a visit to a stall set up by students to showcase their skills and talents in non-formal sectors. Stalls came from both community and private schools. According to the operators of the award in Nepal, it is guided by global standards; the award fosters personal growth, resilience, and leadership, creating confident and responsible individuals ready to make a difference. ""The Duke of Edinburgh International Award is a global platform where individuals (14-24) can participate regardless of gender, background, or ability,"" said Chandrayan Shrestha, the award's founding chair in Nepal. ""The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award (DoEIA) in Nepal encourages overall development through personalised, non-competitive activities. It encourages young people to use their free time productively, fostering physical, mental, and spiritual development rather than focusing on material rewards."" Joel Grant, senior operations manager, Growth and Development at The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Foundation, who is here to support the National Award Operator team in Nepal, showcasing the wonderful achievements of young people through participation in the award framework, told THT, ""this award is about developing young people to find their passion, purpose and place in the world through non-formal education, so learning outside of the classroom."" He further said, ""For example, young people undertake a challenge to do a skill, to develop a skill. It could be a trade skill, a musical instrument, or learning a new language. They do it for one hour per week. They also participate in volunteer work, giving back to their communities, as well as physical recreation, which keeps them fit and healthy."" He said that it encourages holistic development of participants, and they also embark on what he refers to as an adventurous journey, which involves taking them out of their comfort zone, embarking on a journey, discovering their sense of adventure, and developing leadership skills. These areas could be a camping trip and expeditions in the mountains, as it's really about giving young people opportunities to develop things outside of the classroom and be the best versions of themselves. He also mentioned that the programme is available in over 120 countries around the world. And the award operates through our licensed operators. ""National award operators, such as the Nepal office, operate on a social franchise model. Essentially, they are the operator who delivers the award here. So they license schools, youth organisations, and charities to empower their staff and volunteers to deliver the award and serve as adult mentors for the young people taking on the challenge,"" he told THT. ""It's a very special occasion and opportunity as Duke is here in Nepal. His father shares a very special connection with Nepal."" According to him, the three founders were His Royal Highness Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh; Kurt Hahn; and Lord Hunt, who accompanied Sir Hilary on the first expedition to Mount Everest. ""There is a very spiritual connection between the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award and Nepal, so it's a very special case,"" he said. ""Overall, one of his main goals for this trip is to recognise the outstanding achievements of the national award operator."" Shrestha also emphasised that the first expedition of Mount Everest also inspired Prince Philip. inspired by the expedition, he later asked Lord Hunt to design a program so it was designed for the youths because Prince Edward is the patron of the award now, and it is among his many causes that he was here with children and us,"" he told THT. Students from the Scout stall shared that the Scout has also signed an MoU with the award because their activities overlap. ""We receive awards in various categories, which help us achieve better life goals and institutions for education around the world,"" Saurab Neupane told THT from the Scout stall. According to the British Embassy in Kathmandu, 21 outstanding young Nepalis received their Gold Duke of Edinburgh's Award today and many more young Nepalis met the Duke.

They arrived in Kathmandu on Tuesday and were welcomed separately at Tribhuvan International Airport by Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and other high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Later that day, the royal couple paid a courtesy call on President Ramchandra Paudel. During the meeting, Prince Edward emphasized the importance of strengthening Nepal-UK cooperation, particularly in youth and women's empowerment. He also expressed gratitude for Nepal's support in British Army recruitment, noting that the British Gurkha Army remains a cornerstone of the longstanding relationship between the two nations. On Wednesday, the Duchess of Edinburgh visited Bhaktapur Hospital, where she inspected the gynecological ward and gathered information about the services provided. She inquired about the health of new mothers and newborns, as well as the treatments and services available at the hospital. The same day, she visited Maiti Nepal and met with its founder, Anuradha Koirala. She interacted with children and individuals rescued by the organization, which is dedicated to combating human trafficking and rehabilitating survivors. Meanwhile, the Duke of Edinburgh visited the Nepal Vocational Academy in Bhaktapur, where he tried his hand at wood carving. He also explored historic heritage sites in Bhaktapur and visited the SOS Children's Village in Sanothimi. Later in the day, Prince Edward attended the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award (DoEIA)-Nepal at SOS Children's Village, where he visited stalls set up by students from both community and private schools to showcase their skills in non-formal sectors.

According to a press release issued by the President's Secretariat, during the meeting, discussions took place on the existing relations between Nepal and the UK, mutual interests, and areas of common concern. On the occasion, Colonel Commandant of the Brigade of Gurkhas, Major General G. M. Strickland, also presented the annual report of the Brigade of Gurkhas for the year 2024 to the President. President Paudel expressed gratitude to the UK government for presenting the report, saying that the British-Gurkha connection is a key link in the bilateral relationship and has played an important role in strengthening people-to-people ties between Nepal and the UK. In his meeting with the Duke of Edinburgh, President Paudel emphasized that climate change was one of the world's most pressing issues and everyone must work together to address this problem. According to President Paudel's Press Advisor Kiran Pokharel, the President told the Duke of Edinburgh that climate change has become a major concern globally, and Nepal, which has been directly impacted by it, has consistently raised the issue of mountain conservation at international platforms. President Paudel told the British Royal guest that Nepal was set to launch the Sagarmatha Dialogue to highlight the case of climate change. The first edition of this forum will be held in Kathmandu from May 16 to 18, under the theme ""Climate Change, the Himalayas, and the future of humanity."" Recalling the state visits to Nepal by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1961, President Paudel said the visits of British royal family members over the years have helped strengthen the cordial relations between the two countries. ""Nepal and the United Kingdom have had close ties for centuries, and I express gratitude for the UK's ongoing support in Nepal's overall development,"" President Paudel said adding that the UK was Nepal's important development partner. The President also extended his best wishes for the personal happiness and health of King Charles on behalf of the Nepalese people. Earlier today, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Edward, and his wife, Sophie, arrived in Kathmandu for their visit to Nepal. During the meeting, Prince Edward expressed his hope that he would, through his visit, learn about the impact of climate change in Nepal and Nepal's efforts to mitigate it. He also mentioned that he was eager to understand the environmental risks and the effects of climate change on the Himalayas. Prince Edward said that strengthening cooperation between Nepal and the UK in the future would be particularly relevant in the areas of youth and women's empowerment. He thanked Nepal for its support in British Army recruitment saying that the British Gurkha army was the milestone in the longstanding relationship between the two nations. The President also expressed his belief that positive discussions were happening at the bilateral mechanism established to address certain legitimate concerns raised by former British Gurkhas. On the occasion, the wife of Duke of Edinburgh, Sophie, and British Ambassador to Nepal Rob Fenn were also present. British Embassy also issued a press release saying that the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh are making their first visit to Nepal which will celebrate the proud history of UK-Nepal relations as well as the new generation of young people who represent the future. They will salute our shared history, including the proud sense of service through the Gurkha relationship, see Nepal's beauty and culture, meet young people benefiting from participating in the Duke of Edinburgh International Awards, see how UK support has helped Nepal's improvements in maternal healthcare, and engage with women leaders and activists, the British Embassy said in its release. Throughout the visit, the Duke and Duchess will meet a diverse range of people who represent the UK-Nepal partnership – Nepal's oldest bilateral relationship. Following on from the celebration last year of 100 years of the UK-Nepal Treaty of Friendship, they will see how the next 100 years of friendship is developing. This includes seeing how the Duke of Edinburgh International Award is helping young people develop new skills and experiences. They will also see some of the UK - Nepal development partnership in maternal health and in economic development. Their visit will also allow them to see important parts of the 200+ year Gurkha partnership – from attending the annual Attestation Parade in Pokhara where young men join the British Army, through to seeing how veterans and their dependants are supported by the Gurkha Welfare Trust, British Embassy stated in its release. The Embassy said the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh paid a courtesy call on Nepal's President Ramchandra Paudel. The bilateral meeting highlighted the warmth and depth of UK-Nepal historic ties as well as the great respect that exists in the UK for the role of the Gurkhas as the cornerstone of the relationship. This visit is the 14th visit to Nepal by members of the British Royal family, which over the years have celebrated and reinforced the close ties between the two nations. King Charles, as Prince of Wales, visited Nepal in 1975, 1980, 1992 and 1998. The most recent visit was by Prince Harry in 2016.","the, british, uk, gurkha, paudel, visit, relationship, prince, president, gurkhas, nepal, edward, edinburgh, army, royal, strickland, ramchandra, elizabeth, brigade, climate"

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/rabi-lamichhane-suspended-as-lawmaker,Rabi Lamichhane suspended as lawmaker,Bal Krishna Sah,2024-12-24 08:56:49,"KATHMANDU, DECEMBER 23 The Parliament Secretariat has issued a notice suspending Rabi Lamichhane, the elected legislator for Chitwan-2 and President of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). Padma Prasad Pandey, general secretary of the House of Representatives (HoR) Secretariat, published the notice, citing legal provisions, which state that Lamichhane will be suspended until the case is resolved, as a money laundering case has been filed against him in the Kaski District Court. Kaski Police had written to the HoR Secretariat, requesting that Lamichhane's position of Member of Parliament (MP) be suspended. Section 27 of the Money Laundering Act 2008 states that once a case is registered, the post is automatically suspended. The statement has cited Article 27 of the Money Laundering Prevention Act (2008), which provides the automatic suspension, stipulating, 'Any official or staff of any bank, financial institution, non financial institution or civil servant shall be deemed to be automatically suspended for a period he/she is detained as per this Act or until the case filed against him/her pursuant to Section 22 is settled.' However, lawmakers, including the RSP's chief whip, met with Speaker Devraj Ghimire and requested that Speaker Lamichhane not be suspended from his position as an MP. On Monday, Chief Whip Santosh Pariyar, MPs Sobita Gautam, and Ganesh Parajuli met with the Speaker. The RSP lawmakers had argued with the Speaker that the HoR rules should be applied to Lamichhane's case, arguing that he should not be suspended. The HoR rules allow for suspension only if it is decided to send him to detention after a closed-door debate. According to the HoR Rules 2022, information about parliamentary meetings must be provided to the House immediately during the session and posted and made public during the non-session period. Section 248 (3) of the HoR states, ""If a member is detained for trial in a criminal case punishable by imprisonment for three years or more or for moral turpitude under the prevailing law and is in custody for trial, or if he is required to remain in custody for trial pursuant to a court order, but fails to remain in custody and absconds, s/he shall not be entitled to perform any act or enjoy any right or immunity as a member and shall remain suspended."" But this is not the first time Lamichhane's Member of Parliament seat has been threatened. He was previously removed and reelected through byelection. Previously, on January 27, 2023, the Supreme Court removed him from all public offices (deputy prime minister and home minister; party chairperson and parliamentary party leader) as well as his position as a MP for failing to follow due process and obtain new Nepali citizenship after renouncing his American citizenship. A five-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court ruled that the 48-year-old contested the November elections on an invalid citizenship certificate after abandoning his US citizenship. Rabi Lamichhane, who previously won Chitwan-2, again secured victory from the same constituency with more than 40,000 votes. Rabi Lamichhane, who is accused of cooperative fraud, testified before the District Court in Kaski today. On Sunday, the District Attorney's Office in Kaski filed a case against Lamichhane and 31 others on charges of cooperative fraud. Lamichhane has also been charged with organised crime, money laundering, and cooperative fraud. Suraj Adhikari, District Court Kaski's Information Officer, stated that the statements of Lamichhane, Chhabilal Joshi, and five other defendants presented to the court were recorded today. According to the Attorney Office, 63 people have been charged with embezzling funds from the Suryadarshan cooperative in Pokhara. Shanti Devi Sharma, Assistant District Attorney for the Kaski Office, confirmed that 19 people, including Lamichhane, have been charged with organised crime. Similarly, Lamichhane, Ram Bahadur Khanal, Chhabilal Joshi, and Leela Pachai are facing money laundering charges. Lamichhane has been charged with money laundering and faces a claim of Rs 278.94 million. A case has been filed against Chhabilal Joshi for money laundering. Lamichhane was arrested in Kathmandu on October 18 on charges of misappropriating cooperative funds. He is also under investigation in Kaski and other districts, for which he was transported to Rupandehi, Kathmandu, Chitwan and Parsa for interrogation.

According to him, the amount has risen slightly following the supplement charge. The previous figure was around Rs 1.11 billion, and 400 million has been added now.

GB Rai, Lamichhane, and Chhabi Lal Joshi were among the partners in the media company. After leaving the media company in June 2022, Lamichhane entered politics. The report of the parliamentary investigation committee formed to investigate the cooperative fraud had recommended that the then managing director of Gorkha Media Pvt. Ltd., including Rabi Lamichhane, be held responsible for the money diverted from the cooperative and should be brought to book. Lamichhane is currently in police custody in Kaski for alleged cooperative fund misappropriation. Lamichhane has been in police custody since October 18 for allegedly embezzling funds from Pokhara-based Surya Darshan Savings and Cooperatives Limited. He was apprehended in Kathmandu and taken to Kaski. He is also under investigation for alleged misuse of cooperative funds in other districts, for which he was transported to Rupandehi, Kathmandu, Chitwan and Parsa for interrogation.

According to the House of Representatives (HoR) Rules 2022, information about parliamentary meetings must be provided to the House immediately during the session and posted and made public during the non-session period.

Inaugurating the 30th CAN Infotech 2025 in Kathmandu on Thursday, organized by the Federation of Computer Association Nepal (CAN Federation), the government spokesperson stressed the need for robust IT infrastructure to implement the Digital Nepal Framework effectively. ""To achieve the objectives of the Digital Nepal Framework, we must develop adequate IT infrastructure. We will establish an IT Park in Kathmandu this year-without fail,"" he affirmed. Minister Gurung underscored that the absence of an IT Park reflects Nepal's lag in technological advancement. He reiterated his commitment to developing IT-related infrastructure, drafting IT and AI policies, and formulating necessary legal and physical frameworks. Additionally, the minister announced that 4G services would be expanded across all 753 local levels, while 5G services would be introduced in the Kathmandu Valley within the year. Acknowledging Nepal's delay in formulating an AI policy compared to other SAARC nations, Gurung warned that failure to maximize IT adoption would leave the country further behind in the global digital landscape. During the event, a video message from Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli was presented, in which he expressed confidence that the new ordinance introduced by the government has fostered a favorable environment for IT industries, even in foreign markets, thereby generating new opportunities for youth employment.

According to Nepal Police CIB spokesperson Habindra Bogati, Prasain was arrested on charges of cybercrime from his Bhaktapur residence on Tuesday afternoon for disseminating disinformation, alleging PM Oli for investment in Cambodia. Bogti also stated that Prasain was arrested for spreading hatred and malice by spreading misleading information about PM KP Oli's investment in Cambodia, which affected public morals and manners. Prasain, who also describes himself as a social activist, stated on a programme that PM Oli's shares in Cambodia are worth 210 million US dollars. Following that, he held a press conference at his home, according to his official Facebook page. Police was supposed to be presented before the court today, but he was only taken into custody for further investigation after health check-ups. Prasain recently revealed documents related to PM Oli, alleging that he invested Rs 32.50 billion in a Cambodian telecom company via video call. ""Look at KP Oli's investment in Cambodia, the true character of the current Prime Minister of the country,"" reads his Facebook post. ""I am ready to die, but I am not ready to bow down to such smugglers. I am aware that making this public has put my life in danger. I also realise that I could be murdered for this. But death is inevitable, even if I die, I am willing to do so in order to expose these smugglers to my Nepali brothers and sisters."" Today, before being arrested, he wrote on Facebook, ""Yesterday, immediately after making public the issue of KP Oli's investment in Cambodia through a press conference, the government has once again prepared to arrest me, filing false charges. I request everyone to remain alert and vigilant even if I am arrested on cybercrime, treason or any other charges."" A screenshot of the allegation has been making numerous rounds on every social media platform since it was shared, making headlines in the majority of major national media outlets. Prasain has been accusing Prime Minister Oli for quite some time. He stated in the video that Oli told the House that he would add some amount to the invested amount and give it to the person who could prove that he invested in Cambodia after Prasain made the allegation. He also stated that he took the initiative to obtain a verified document proving Oli owns shares worth $ 210 million (approximately Rs 32.5 billion). ""I have furnished authentic documents, as Oli would claim that it is fabricated,"" Prasai stated.

In light of this, the Children and Youth (BaYu) Sambaad was held here today to highlight their specific vulnerabilities, amplify their voices, and promote youth-led innovations and solutions for climate resilience and sustainability. Experts speaking and presenting at the programme emphasised that climate change poses a serious threat to child rights around the world. Children and youth who participated in the dialogue expressed unequivocally that climate change has cost them dearly. They emphasised that schools and colleges are closed during droughts or disasters such as floods and landslides. Moreover, Kathmandu recently was listed as the most polluted city for a long time, putting children at the receiving end. Jayanti Bam, a child representative from Gambhir School, stated that climate change has posed a significant threat to children's growth. ""Last year, my school was flooded by relentless rain, which had a significant impact on my education,"" she said. ""This also has an impact on our four major children's rights."" Nepal's constitution and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) recognise four broad categories of child rights: the right to survival, the right to protection, the right to participation, and the right to development. Presenting Children's Vulnerability to Climate Change, Rakshya Rajyashwori Thapa, South Asia Regional Climate Advisor, UNICEF Regional Office for South Asia, stated that climate change affects every child. The world is facing a child rights crisis. She said, ""Children are more susceptible to climate change. 600 million children and youth are at the receiving end due to air pollution and climate change. A child's body is unlike an adult's. Furthermore, children breathe faster than adults, resulting in greater exposure to toxic particles. Children's bodies also dehydrate more quickly than adults. This can have a lifelong detrimental impact on children."" She added, ""347 million children in South Asia are exposed to high water scarcity, the highest among all regions. Around 70 million of the region's children live in drought-prone areas. In addition, over 10 million children in Nepal are exposed to vector-borne diseases linked to climate change, and 2.8 million children are exposed to extreme high temperatures."" Youth representative Nischal Bhatt shared that youth participation is inevitable in every sector. ""However, our participation is not properly secured. Thus, the government must ensure participation in each policy discussion,"" he said. Addressing the programme, Alice Akunga, UN resident coordinator ad interim, said that it is a very historic and significant event not just for Nepal but for the world. ""We have been talking about climate change for years, but now we can see it. It is not just about glacier melting and flooding; it is about the impact on child rights and other issues,"" she said. ""Half of Nepal's population is at risk due to climate change, which they did not cause. The impact on them lasts from womb to tomb."" She further said, ""However, they are not only victims and impacted but also solution providers. As a result, we must recognise them, including the Nepal government, and address them. That is why BaYu Sambaad is important, as it is a side event of Sagarmatha Sambaad that will advance our policy formulation agenda in the right direction."" Minister for Forest and Environment, Ain Bahadur Shahi Thakuri, stated that in order to work on climate change, we are organising Sagarmatha Sambaad to raise our concerns and call on the world to take action. ""We recently organised a programme in Thame village, which had been flooded, and decided to include them in Sagarmatha Sambaad. Furthermore, similar work has been carried out in all of the provinces,"" he said. ""The government is working tirelessly to ensure everyone's future in Nepal. Despite its small role in greenhouse gas emissions, climate change has had a significant impact on all aspects of our lives. As a result, the countries responsible for emissions must seriously consider how to reduce them. Nepal also aims to achieve zero emissions by 2045.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/environment/unesco-report-paints-bleak-picture-of-climate-change-impacts-on-ecosystems,UNESCO report paints bleak picture of climate change impacts on ecosystems,Bal Krishna Sah,2025-03-22 12:14:15,"KATHMANDU, MARCH 21 The United Nations World Water Development Report 2025, published by UNESCO on behalf of UN-Water, reveals that climate disruption, biodiversity loss, and unsustainable activities are transforming mountain environments at an unprecedented rate, threatening water resources, and putting billions of people and countless ecosystems at risk. ""Regardless of where we live, we all depend in some way on mountains and glaciers. But these essential natural water towers are facing imminent peril,"" said Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO. ""This report demonstrates the urgent need for action and that the most effective solutions require a multilateral approach."" According to the report, mountains account for up to 60 per cent of global freshwater flows each year. More than one billion people live in mountainous areas, and over two billion rely on mountain water for drinking, sanitation, and livelihoods. ""Water flows downhill, but food insecurity rises uphill. The earth's mountains provide 60 per cent of our freshwater, but the communities that safeguard these vital resources are among the most food insecure. We must invest in their resilience to protect glaciers, rivers and a shared future for all of us,"" said Alvaro Lario, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and Chair of UN-Water. Mountain regions are critical to industries like pastoralism, forestry, tourism, and energy production. Mountain areas account for 85% of hydropower generation in Andean countries. Mountains also provide high-value products such as medicinal plants, timber and other forest products, unique mountain livestock, and specialty agricultural products, all of which require water. However, the report states that glaciers all over the world are melting at unprecedented rates, and that mountain waters are frequently the first to be exposed and vulnerable to the severe consequences of climate and biodiversity disruptions. Dr Rijan Bhakta Kayastha, Professor of Glaciology at Kathmandu University, stated that previous studies showed Nepal had 3,252 glaciers in 2001, which had grown to 3,808 by 2010. Similarly, data from ICIMOD and UNDP show that there were 2,323 glacial lakes in 2001, 1,466 in 2010, and 2,070 in 2015. ""The changing numbers are due to glacier melting, thawing, division, and merging processes,"" he said. ""There are 47 potentially dangerous glacial lakes in Nepal's major river basins-42 in the Koshi, three in the Gandaki, and two in the Karnali. Additionally, from 1977 to 2010, Nepal lost 24 per cent of its glacier area and 29 per cent of its ice reserves, posing serious concerns for water resources and livelihoods."" Today the situation is critical: up to half of rural mountain dwellers in developing countries suffer from food insecurity, with women and children being most at risk. More broadly, the report reveals that receding glaciers and dwindling snowfall in mountains would impact two-thirds of all irrigated agriculture in the world and will have wide-reaching implications for the vast majority of the population. According to Dr Mohan P. Chand, Assistant Professor at Kathmandu University, the cryosphere encompasses all forms of Earth's ice, including snow, glaciers, sea ice, frozen ground, and atmospheric ice. ""About 10 per cent of the Earth's land is covered by glaciers or ice sheets, and due to climate change, glaciers are melting at an alarming rate, increasing the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Nepal has recorded 54 GLOFs, resulting in 36 fatalities and the displacement of 1,050 people,"" he said. According to the report, there is now an urgent need for international cooperation and adaptation strategies and actions to face the unfolding crisis in our mountains and glaciers. Pema Gyamtsho, director general of ICIMOD, stated, ""I always refer to Nepal as the mountain capital of the world. If these mountains melt, all forms of life will face danger as their colours shift from white to grey. Despite being signatories to all global conventions, we are not acting. So, rather than waiting for data or enough information, it is time to take practical and impactful action to protect our planet from imminent peril."" Speaking at a programme here today to commemorate Nepal National Glacier, Water, and Weather Week 2025 and World Glaciers Day, Minister of Forests and Environment Ain Bahadur Shahi Thakuri, emphasised the importance of preserving glaciers and how their melting has impacted our rivers and water sources, access to safely managed drinking water, hydropower, and overall climate change. ""Climate change has deeply impacted the climate ecosystem of Nepal, accelerating disasters and glacier melting. Thus, for a sustainable future for all, we must act to protect glaciers,"" he said.","mountain, water, glaciers, glacier, climate, ice, cent, the, per, report, earth, mountains, agricultural, bhakta, freshwater, kayastha, rijan, products, melting, change"
https://thehimalayantimes.com/environment/most-nations-miss-deadline-for-plans-to-fight-climate-change-un-says-take-your-time-to-do-it-right,Most nations miss deadline for plans to fight climate change. UN says take your time to do it right,Associated Press,2025-02-11 22:02:25,"LONDON, FEBRUARY 11 Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations' climate chief calls ""among the most important policy documents governments will produce this century"" - their plans on how they will cut emissions of heat-trapping gases. Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them. So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions - the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas - and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration. Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide. U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he's not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness. ""Taking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,"" Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. ""These will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed."" Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving. ""It's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,"" Patel said. ""The world cannot afford inaction."" These plans - officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs - are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N. Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year. The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement. Climate Action Tracker - a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions - found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an ""almost sufficient"" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming. Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars - which only use gasoline and diesel - by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation. Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their ""fair share"" is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement. ""We know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,"" Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. ""They all need to do more."" The deadline - set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil - is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is. But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise. That's a big if. The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.","degrees, climate, the, plans, nations, emissions, celsius, gases, agreement, dioxide, warming, united, heat, plan, deadline, stiell, niklas, tracker, fahrenheit, hohne"

Locals report that the region has experienced rising temperatures in recent years, which they attribute to the impacts of climate change. This shift has significantly strained local water resources, they say. During recent gatherings held in Gharapjhong and Waragung Muktikshetra rural municipalities, residents voiced their concerns over the dwindling water sources, which are adversely affecting agricultural practices and livestock farming. Deepak Sherchan, a member of the Local Water Consumers Committee in Jomsom, stated that the growing water shortage is directly linked to the depletion of natural sources. ""On the one hand, natural water sources are vanishing; on the other, the number of households in Jomsom is increasing,"" he said. ""It has now become increasingly difficult to meet the water demands for domestic use, livestock, and agriculture."" Sherchan urged authorities to explore alternative solutions to address the mounting crisis. ""Apple farming yields a good harvest one year, but production drops drastically the next,"" lamented one farmer, highlighting the unpredictable impact of water scarcity on agriculture. A cattle farmer from Gharapjhong added that the highlands of Mustang have recently received little to no snowfall, hampering vegetation growth and severely impacting yak rearing. Moreover, due to the lack of vegetation, wildlife has increasingly descended into human settlements in search of food, raising further concerns among locals. Although there are three glacial sources supplying drinking water to Jomsom Bazaar, these sources are depleting due to the effects of climate change, Sherchan said. Even though the water sources at Kungle Hill and Thini remain viable for providing drinking water to Jomsom Market, a shortage persists due to the drying up of snow-fed sources. ""The demand for drinking water is high because it is a commercial hub,"" Sherchan added. ""As the water sources continue to deplete, there is an urgent need to explore long-term solutions and alternative water sources."" Rajendra Sherchan, a farmer from Gharapjhong-4, said that snowfall during the critical periods of apple and indigenous crop harvests has ceased. Due to the absence of timely snowfall, unseasonal snow events, premature flower fall in orchards, rising temperatures, and an increase in crop diseases, the production and quality of key crops-including apples-have begun to deteriorate.","sources, water, farmer, sherchan, gharapjhong, muktikshetra, waragung, the, jomsom, crop, farming, apple, shortage, snow, solutions, snowfall, rearing, harvests, kungle, depletion"

More than 40% of the migrants, authorities say, won't voluntarily return to their homeland. Migrants in the hotel rooms held messages to the windows reading ""Help"" and ""We are not save (sic) in our country."" The migrants hailed from 10 mostly Asian countries, including Iran, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China and others. The U.S. has difficulty deporting directly to some of those countries so Panama is being used as a stopover. Costa Rica was expected to receive a similar flight of third-country deportees on Wednesday. Panama's Security Minister Frank Abrego said Tuesday the migrants are receiving medical attention and food as part of a migration agreement between Panama and the U.S. The Panamanian government has now agreed to serve as a ""bridge"" or transit country for deportees, while the U.S. bears all the costs of the operation. The agreement was announced earlier this month after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino, who faces political pressure over Trump's threats of retaking control of the Panama Canal, announced the arrival of the first of the deportation flights last Thursday. The confinement and legal limbo the deportees face has raised alarm in the Central American country, especially as images spread of migrants peaking through the windows of their rooms on high floors of the hotel and displaying the notes pleading for help. Abrego denied the foreigners are being detained even though they cannot leave the rooms of their hotel, which is being guarded by police. Abrego said that 171 of the 299 deportees have agreed to return voluntarily to their respective countries with help from the International Organization for Migration and the U.N. Refugee Agency. U.N. agencies are talking with the other 128 migrants in an effort to find a destination for them in third countries. Abrego said that one deported Irish citizen has already returned to her country. Those who do not agree to return to their countries will be temporarily held in a facility in the remote Darien province through which hundreds of thousands of migrants have crossed on their journey north in recent years, Abrego said. The Panamanian Ombudsman's Office was scheduled to provide more details on the deportees' situation later Tuesday.","panama, deportees, hotel, migrants, panamanian, the, rooms, countries, migration, abrego, mulino, raúl, josé, frank, 300, trump, country, nearly, costa, darien"

In a fresh crackdown on scam centers operating from Southeast Asia, the Thai army announced Thursday it is coordinating an effort to repatriate some 260 people believed to have been victims of human trafficking after they were rescued and sent from Myanmar to Thailand. Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which share borders with Thailand, have become known as havens for criminal syndicates who are estimated to have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. Such scams have extracted tens of billions of dollars from victims around the world, according to U.N. experts, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and trapped in virtual slavery. An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023 after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations in Myanmar's northern Shan state along its border. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated. The army said that those rescued in the most recent operation came from 20 nationalities - with significant numbers from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan and China. There were also nationals of Indonesia, Nepal, Taiwan, Uganda, Laos, Brazil, Burundi, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana and India. They were sent across the border from Myanmar's Myawaddy district to Thailand's Tak province on Wednesday. Reports in Thai media said a Myanmar ethnic militia that controls the area where they were held, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, was responsible for freeing the workers and taking them to the border. Myanmar's military government exercises little control over frontier areas where ethnic minorities predominate. Several ethnic militias are believed to be involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking and protecting call-center scam operations. The Thai army statement said the rescued people will undergo questioning, and if determined to be victims of human trafficking, will enter a process of protection while waiting to be sent back to their countries. Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who is also defense minister, said Wednesday that there might be many more scam workers waiting to be repatriated from Myanmar through Thailand, but that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their country of origin. ""I've made it clear that Thailand is not going to set up another shelter,"" he told reporters during a visit in Sa Kaeo province, which borders Cambodia. Thailand hosts nine refugee camps along the border holding more than 100,000 people, most from Myanmar's ethnic Karen minority. Phumtham added that Thailand would also need to question them before sending them back, first is to make sure that they are victims of human trafficking, and also to get information that would help the police investigate the trafficking and scam problems. On a visit to China in early February, Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China's leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks that plague Southeast Asia. Many dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Bangkok only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar have surfaced. Chinese actor Wang Xing was a high-profile case but was quickly rescued after his tale spread on social media. Underlining Beijing's concern, Liu Zhongyi, China's Vice Minister of Public Security and Commissioner of its Criminal Investigation Bureau, made an official visit to Thailand last month and inspected the border area opposite where many of the Myanmar's scam centers are located. Just ahead of Paetongtarn's visit to China, the Thai government issued an order to cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border with northern Thailand, citing national security and severe damage that the country has suffered from scam operations. Her government is considering expanding this measure to Thailand's northeastern areas bordering Cambodia, said Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Thanathip Sawangsang, who explained that officials had already removed internet cables that were installed illegally in the areas.","scam, myanmar, thai, army, 260, thailand, ethnic, centers, paetongtarn, criminal, karen, trafficking, wechayachai, xing, benevolent, sawangsang, thanathip, kaeo, myawaddy, phumtham"

Her children, twins Roc and Roe, joined in on the fun. At one point, Carey detoured into a medley of her biggest hits: ""Emotions,"" ""Hero,"" ""Fantasy,"" and ""We Belong Together"" among them. The latter moment came with an unexpected surprise: the elusive Rihanna was in the audience, and Carey signed her chest during an arena-wide sing-a-long of ""Always Be My Baby."" Ri disappeared as quickly as she emerged, but Carey kept the momentum up, concluding the only way she could - with a spirited rendition of ""All I Want for Christmas Is You."" Earlier this year, Carey's first Christmas album, 1994's ""Merry Christmas,"" turned 30. She told The Associated Press she originally felt apprehensive to record a holiday album and then gave in to the festive spirit. ""I was very young and was just starting out and I felt like people do Christmas albums later in their lives. But now people have started to do them whenever, like right at the top of their career,"" she said.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/a-deeper-look-at-the-talks-between-us-and-russian-officials-as-trump-suggests-ukraine-is-to-blame,A deeper look at the talks between US and Russian officials as Trump suggests Ukraine is to blame,Associated Press,2025-02-19 13:45:59,"RIYADH, FEBRUARY 19 Top U.S. and Russian officials had their most extensive high-level engagement since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine almost three years ago, meeting for four hours Tuesday before President Donald Trump suggested that Kyiv was to blame for the conflict. Trump showed little patience for Ukraine's objections to being excluded from the talks in Saudi Arabia. He said repeatedly that Ukraine's leaders never should have allowed the conflict to begin, indicating Kyiv should have been willing to make concessions to Russia before it sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. ""Today I heard, 'Oh, well, we weren't invited.' Well, you been there for three years. You should have ended it three years"" ago, Trump told reporters at his Florida residence. ""You should have never started it. You could have made a deal."" Such comments and Trump's goal of mending ties with Moscow may come at a cost to the transatlantic alliance of the U.S. and Europe and significantly damage Washington's standing with Ukraine as well as with other nations counting on U.S. leadership in NATO and elsewhere for their security and protection. During former President Joe Biden's administration, the U.S. and Europe focused on isolating Russia and defending the post-World War II international order. In Riyadh, the delegations led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to set up teams to look into restoring staffing at the U.S. and Russian embassies in Moscow and Washington that have been decimated by a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions. The effort is aimed at using those channels to support Ukraine peace negotiations and to explore ways to restart economic and global cooperation. A Russian official pointed to possible joint energy ventures. Here's a look at the meeting and what comes next: Reestablishing tattered diplomatic relations First on both countries' list of accomplishments was an agreement to end what has been years of dwindling diplomatic relations that hit a post-Cold War low point after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. The meeting, which came just a week after Trump spoke to Putin by phone, was the first substantive face-to-face discussion between the nations' top diplomats since former Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Lavrov in Geneva in January 2022 in an unsuccessful bid to prevent the Ukraine conflict. Lavrov said after Tuesday's talks that the sides agreed to fast-track the appointment of new ambassadors, adding that senior diplomats from the two countries will meet shortly to discuss specifics related to ""lifting artificial barriers to the work of the U.S. and Russian embassies and other missions."" In reality, the decimation of the U.S. and Russian embassies' personnel began well before Russian troops rolled into Ukraine in 2022, starting after 2014 Russia's annexation of Crimea. That was seen as illegal by most of the world during the Obama administration, which ordered several Russian offices in the U.S. to close. It picked up steam after the 2018 poisoning in Britain of an exiled Russian spy and his daughter, which British authorities blamed on Russia, and which resulted in mass expulsions of diplomats and the closure of numerous consulates in both countries and Europe. Asked by The Associated Press if the U.S. now considered those cases closed, Rubio declined to say but said it would be impossible to get a Ukraine peace agreement without diplomatic engagement. ""I'm not going to negotiate or talk through every element of the disruptions that exist or have existed in our diplomatic relations, on the mechanics of it,"" he said. Bringing an end to the conflict cannot happen ""unless we have at least some normalcy in the way our diplomatic missions operate in Moscow and in Washington, D.C."" Negotiating an end to the conflict in Ukraine The two sides agreed to set up high-level working groups to begin exploring a negotiated end to the conflict. It was not immediately clear when these teams would first meet, but both said it would be soon. As to concessions that may need to be made by all sides, Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who participated in the talks Tuesday, said the issue of territory and security guarantees would be among the subjects discussed. Rubio said a high-level team, including experts who know technical details, will begin to engage with the Russian side on ""parameters of what an end to this conflict would look like."" On the key issue of a prospective peacekeeping mission to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, the top Russian diplomat said Moscow would not accept any troops from NATO members, repeating its assertion that Ukraine's bid to join the Western military alliance poses a major security issue. ""We explained that the deployment of troops from the countries that are NATO members, even if they are deployed under the EU or national flags, will not change anything and will certainly be unacceptable for us,"" Lavrov said. Exclusion of Ukraine and Europe from the talks Neither Ukraine nor European nations were invited to Tuesday's talks in Riyadh, but U.S. officials said there is no intention to exclude them from peace negotiations should they begin in earnest. ""No one is being sidelined here,"" Rubio said. ""Obviously, there's going to be engagement and consultation with Ukraine, with our partners in Europe and others. But ultimately, the Russian side will be indispensable to this effort."" Waltz agreed: ""If you're going to bring both sides together, you have to talk to both sides. ... We are absolutely talking to both sides."" He noted that Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy immediately after speaking with Putin last week and that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Rubio met Friday with Zelenskyy in Germany. Still, Zelenskyy was clearly peeved at being omitted from the meeting, postponing plans to visit Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to avoid any linkage of his trip with Tuesday's U.S.-Russia talks. And that was before Trump's comments suggesting Kyiv was at fault in starting the fighting. ""This whole negotiation from the start seems very tilted in Russia's favor. And it's even a question whether it should be termed a negotiation or in some sense, a series of American capitulations,"" said Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Eurasia and Russia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former British ambassador to Belarus. Possible lifting of US sanctions against Russia Asked whether the U.S. could lift sanctions against Moscow imposed during the Biden presidency, Rubio noted that ""to bring an end to any conflict, there has to be concessions made by all sides"" and ""we're not going to predetermine what those are."" Asked if the U.S. could officially remove Lavrov from its sanctions list, Rubio said that ""we're just not at that level of conversation yet."" Potential US-Russian cooperation Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund who joined the Russian delegation in Riyadh, told reporters that Russia and the U.S. should develop joint energy ventures. ""We need joint projects, including in the Arctic and other regions,"" he said. Should the parties succeed in negotiating an end to the Ukraine conflict, Rubio said, it could open ""incredible opportunities"" to partner with the Russians ""on issues that hopefully will be good for the world and also improve our relations in the long term."" He did not say what those would entail.","russian, the, ukraine, diplomatic, trump, sides, conflict, expulsions, dmitriev, embassies, lavrov, negotiation, sergey, kirill, relations, war, ventures, president, level, vance"

According to Himalayan Ski Trek and Adventure, Pakenaite Karoline, who is both deaf and blind, scaled Mera peak on November 22 as she was guided by Susan Thapa and Mingma Tenzing Sherpa. ""As a part of her training for Mt Everest, she scaled Mera Peak,"" expedition organiser said. After climbing Mera Peak, the climber shared: ""That was the hardest thing I have ever done, and I would not have made it without Mingma Tenzing Sherpa and Susan Magar Thapa. We skipped acclimatisation due to a small weather window, so I was battling high-altitude sickness. I was sleepy, weak, and struggling to stay awake. At one point, in tears, my guides stopped me to look east toward Everest, reminding me of my purpose. The seven-hour uphill climb pushed me to my limits, but it taught me perseverance and trust in my team. When we finally reached the summit, it felt unreal. I'm just an ordinary person with big dreams, and this success was only possible because of my incredible guides from HST Adventures,"" By climbing mountains, Karoline said she wanted to raise awareness about Usher syndrome and deafblindness. ""Many assume that blindness is black and white but there's complexity and possibility. I aim to challenge societal perceptions and inspire others to overcome limitations."" Karoline's goal is now to become the first deafblind person to summit Everest. ""Since trekking to EBC in 2023, I've trained through milestones like the UK's National Three Peaks Challenge in 24 hours, the London Marathon, and now Mera Peak. Mera Peak was also an opportunity to start building rapport with my Everest guides, understanding each other's strengths and how to work together. Next, I plan to summit Mount Kenya, complete an ultramarathon in Scotland, and return to Nepal to climb a 7000m peak like Himlung or Manaslu - each step preparing for Everest while raising awareness and inspiring others to embrace challenges,"" she shared.","peak, mera, susan, karoline, my, guides, metre, tenzing, peaks, deafblind, usher, ultramarathon, hst, 476, november, blind, syndrome, sherpa, thapa, everest"

Of them, six are Nepali. According to Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP) Chief, Dr. Rabin Kadariya, among the dead, 11 are Indians, two are Malaysian, one is Ukrainian and one is Briton. Most of the casualties took place along the Muktinath area in Mustang. Some people suffering the altitude sickness were rescued by helicopters. As Kadariya said, the ACAP started archiving such incidents last year. A journey to a high altitude demands special care. It should be undertaken gradually, getting adjusted to the atmospheric conditions, he said. Once the altitude sickness is sensed, one should promptly climb down, he said. A human skeleton of a Swedish national who had missing during the Mardi Peak trek was found recently after seven months of missing. A sole trek along a long route is not recommended. It must be observed in a group or accompanied by a guide. The ACAP welcomed 222,180 foreign tourists last year. Of them, 117845 were from Asian countries, and 104,256 were from other countries. The highest arrivals: 35,265 were in the month of Chaita (March-April) and the lowest was 5401 in the month of Saun (July-August), the first month of the fiscal year. Dr Kadariya said last year around 50,000 more people visited the area compared to the previous fiscal year. A total of 172,510 people: 89,777 from South Asia and 82,733 visited the area during the fiscal year 2079-80 BS (2022-23). The Annapurna Conservation Area spanning 7,600 square kilometers covers 89 wards of 16 local levels in Kaski, Lamjung, Manang, Myagdi, and Mustang.

https://kathmandupost.com/pages/about-us,About Us,Kantipur Media Group,,"ABOUT US The Kathmandu Post, the country’s leading English-language daily, was launched in February 1993 as Nepal’s first private-run English-language broadsheet. The Post is the second-most widely read paper in Nepal after its sister publication, the Nepali-language Kantipur daily. Since establishment, the Post has cultivated a reputation for reliability, veracity and breaking news. The Post’s political, business, sports, and arts and culture reporting are supplemented with opinions from some of Nepal’s, and the wider world’s, leading intellectuals and analysts. Since July 2009, the paper has been producing a weekend supplement–On Saturday–focusing on long-form journalism, satire and creative non-fiction. Apart from its regular pages and weekly supplements, the paper also publishes yearly special issues, such as on the Gregorian New Year and on its anniversary in February. More recently, the Post has begun conducting investigations into corruption, malpractices and sexual harassment. With an estimated daily readership of over 600,000 readers, both on the web and in print, the Post has developed a new language to tell Nepal’s stories in English to both local and international audiences. The Post is committed to ethical journalism that privileges facts and the truth. The Post is published simultaneously from Kathmandu, Biratnagar, Bharatpur and Nepalgunj.","language, paper, intellectuals, supplements, broadsheet, journalism, readership, gregorian, supplement, yearly, weekly, harassment, pages, sister, web, english, the, audiences, publication, readers"

https://kathmandupost.com/pages/kathmandu-post-editorial-standards-and-integrity,Kathmandu Post Editorial Standards and Integrity,Kantipur Media Group,,"Editorial Standards & Integrity The Kathmandu Post is a progressive newspaper. We believe in fairness and equality of opportunity. We believe that everyone—regardless of gender, caste, class, ethnicity, or sexual orientation—should be able to enjoy the same rights, privileges, and freedoms. Our news reporting and editorials reflect these beliefs and we remain committed to them through our journalism. Our duty is to the truth, the community and our readers—not to private business interests, our owners or our advertisers. We believe that everyone has a right to the truth—unblemished and unvarnished. At a time when trust on news media is declining and there is growing scrutiny throughout the global news business, we have set the following guidelines—both for our journalists and readers—to help understand how we practice our journalism. Ethics policy We at The Kathmandu Post take every measure to ensure that we are telling the whole story, without fear of reprisal or favour to any interests. We shall make all effort to report without prejudice, taking all sides of the story into account. We will omit no detail that could potentially compromise the integrity or objectivity of the story. We will not willingly mislead our readers through selective reporting or cherry-picking of facts. We shall make every effort to reach out to the concerned parties—individuals and organisations—whenever another party makes a claim against them. Everyone should have an opportunity to respond to any allegations made against them. Ownership structure The Kathmandu Post is part of Kantipur Media Group (KMG), which is owned by Kailash Sirohiya. In addition to the Post, the company owns Kantipur Daily, Nepal magazine, Saptahik weekly, Radio Kantipur and Kantipur Television. Conflict of interest Our reporters and editors do not accept any gifts, honorariums, free junkets or any other form of compensation that could potentially harm the integrity of our reporting. When we review a restaurant, we do not accept free food and drink. We pay our way. Exceptions include review copies of books sent to us by publishers and authors, and press tickets to films, theatre shows and performances. In each of these cases, the reporters shall make every effort to remain objective, and editors shall make every effort to ascertain whether the story is free of interest. Our reporters accept no payment from any public servants, politicians, or governmental individuals and organisations. When it comes to private and non-governmental organisations, our reporters make every effort to refrain from any form of compensation from the individuals and organisations they are directly involved in covering. Reporters cannot make their relatives and family members the subjects or sources of their own stories. Reporting and opinion We at the Post draw a hard line between reporting and opinion. The only opinions on our pages appear on the Op-Ed pages, as reviews and on the As It Is section of our On Saturday weekend edition. The editorial is the only space that reflects the opinion of the newspaper. All other opinion pieces published on the Op-Ed pages and under the As It Is section reflect the views of their authors and not necessarily those of The Kathmandu Post. Reviews—books, films, theatre, restaurants—are written by our critics, who take literary, culinary, artistic or aesthetic values into account. We do not accept compensation for any kind of reviews. An analysis is not opinion. An analysis is based on an interpretation of facts and a diverse selection of views. We will clearly mark all opinion pieces as such, in the paper, on the website, and on social platforms. All opinion pieces should be directed to the Op-Ed desk at [email protected]. Plagiarism The Kathmandu Post does not tolerate plagiarism in any form. We believe in journalistic integrity and providing credit whenever it is due. All our sources will be clearly labelled. Any contributors found to have plagiarised their submissions will be summarily blacklisted from the Post. Please take note that plagiarism is not limited to just words but also ideas. When we build upon or move forward a story someone has already reported on, we will clearly cite them. Sourcing and attribution We will make all effort to obtain information “on the record.” But as this is not always possible, we will make all effort to make certain that the source is being truthful and accurate. We will also make an attempt, if possible, to obtain the same information from a different source who is willing to go on record. We understand that identifying the source of our information is vital to maintaining credibility in the eyes of our readers. The identity of all confidential sources will be protected, limited to the reporter, the assignment editor and the chief editor. If sources wish to speak to us off the record, they must make it clear at the very outset. The Post is unable to hold publication because a source has cold feet. Reporters will make all effort possible to communicate whether the conversation is on or off the record. To learn how to send tips, confidential or otherwise, please visit this page. Corrections We make mistakes and it is our policy to correct errors as soon as we notice them. These errors can range from fixing typos to mistakes that substantially change the thrust of the original story. Typos will be fixed without a corrective note. More substantial errors, such as mistakes in attribution and data, will be updated along with a corrective note. Major mistakes will be addressed through an Editor’s Note, displayed prominently. All our corrected articles can be found here. Letters to the editor We welcome feedback, whether through engagement on our social media profiles or through the paper via letters to the editor. Letters will be edited for brevity and grammar. See our instructions on how to send a letter to the editor. Fiction and poetry The Kathmandu Post publishes fiction and poetry on literary and artistic merit on a weekly basis. These pieces will be clearly marked as fiction or poetry. Please send all fiction and poetry submissions to [email protected]. Advertising Guidelines The Kathmandu Post will not allow any relationship with an advertising agency or an advertiser to affect the Post’s editorial integrity. All advertising content will be distinguishable from the publication’s editorial content. Any advertising content that is made to look or may appear like editorial content will be clearly labelled as “advertisement” or “sponsor content.” The Post, if needed, will use its discretion to refuse or remove any advertisements that undermine the integrity or harm the reputation of the publication or the parent company. Sponsor Content Guidelines Sponsor Content is any content created or commissioned by advertisers in collaboration with the Post’s marketing team. The sponsored content do not reflect the views and decisions of the Post’s editorial team. As a clear distinction to separate it from the editorial content, the Post will prominently display the term ‘SPONSOR CONTENT’ on all sponsored material—in print, online, and on social media platforms. At the request and depending on the agreement with the advertiser, the Post may allow readers to comment and engage with sponsor content on its platforms.","content, editorial, our, the, sponsor, advertising, any, integrity, guidelines, all, standards, pieces, reporters, kantipur, reporting, opinion, editor, story, submissions, advertiser"
https://kathmandupost.com/pages/kathmandu-post-policy-against-harassment,Kathmandu Post Policy Against Harassment,Kantipur Media Group,,"KANTIPUR PUBLICATIONS LTD WORKPLACE HARASSMENT POLICY Kantipur Publications Ltd. is committed to providing a safe environment for all its employees, free from discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment, at work. Kantipur Publication’s harassment policy aims to protect men and women in our company from unwanted provocations and give them guidelines to report incidents. We will also explain how we handle claims, take actions against harassment and help victims recover. Kantipur Publications will not tolerate harassment in the workplace in any shape or form as our culture is based on mutual respect and collaboration. Harassment of any kind is a serious violation of those principles. What is Harassment? Harassment covers a wide range of behaviour that demeans, humiliates or embarrasses a person, and it is characteristically identified by its unlikelihood in terms of social and moral reasonableness. These are behaviours that appear to be disturbing, upsetting or threatening to another individual. It also includes situations where a person is asked to engage in undesirable activity as a condition of that person’s employment, as well as situations which create an environment that is hostile, intimidating or humiliating for the person on the receiving end. Furthermore, workplace harassment creates a mental, physical and psychological effect that compromises and undermines an individual’s productivity and motivation. Harassment may be physical, verbal and non-verbal. Examples of conduct or behaviour which constitute harassment include, but are not limited to: Physical Conduct Unwelcome physical contact including patting, pinching, stroking, kissing, hugging, fondling, or inappropriate touching Physical abuse/violence, including sexual assault The use of job-related threats or rewards to solicit sexual favours Verbal Conduct Comment on an individual's sexual orientation, religious belief, race, origination, ethnicity, birthplace, physical & mental disability, private life (family, marriage, qualification etc.) appearance, age, gender, income etc. Use of offensive language, taunts, innuendo and insults. Severe conduct (intimidation and bullying), abuse of power and authority. Sexual advances, gender supression, voicing out. Repeated and unwanted communication request, unwelcoming social invitations for dates or physical intimacy. Comments on looks, dress, sexuality or gender in a derogatory manner with or without the intent to creating an uncomfortable environment. Spreading rumors, belittling Making sexist or obscene comments, jokes or gestures that humiliate or offend an individual. Flirting in an inappropriate setting (for example, during news meetings, reporting trips or official gathering) without their participation in a way that could degrade and harm their professional reputation. Non-Verbal Conduct Display of sexually explicit, pornographic or suggestive material Sending undesirable sexually explicit messages Sexually-suggestive gestures, whistling, leering, winking Inadvertent Harassment Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behaviour is wrong. We understand this is possible, but that doesn’t make the perpetrator any less responsible for their actions. If you suspect that someone doesn’t realize their behaviour is harassment under the definition of this policy, let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records. Please do not use this approach when your line manager, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator. How to report or complain about harassment Any forms of harassment can exhaust those who endure it. Speaking up about this issue is often tough because of the fear of not being heard, upsetting managers and challenging corporate culture. Please don’t let these fears deter you. We need to know what is going on in the workplace so we can act on it—immediately. By raising your voice on this issue, you help your company create a happy, healthy workplace. The Government of Nepal has enacted specific legislation addressing sexual harassment at the workplace with the objective to protect the right of every individual to work in a safe environment. The Sexual Harassment at Workplace Prevention Act, 2015. The Sexual Harassment Prevention Act envisages two internal and external complaint mechanisms. Internal Complaint Mechanism Under the internal complaint handling mechanism the employer or the manager having the authority to decide on administrative matters, or head of the department of the entity handling administrative matters such as HR department shall handle the complaints. If you are being harassed or have witnessed harassment of any of your colleagues in your units, department, bureaus, or in the newsroom, please report it to the HOD immediately. If you do not hear from the HOD within 24 hours, or if you are not comfortable speaking with a male head of your department, please contact Ms. Barsha Thapa, Sr. Executive—Human Resources, who will coordinate a response directly with the top management. We encourage to file complaints as soon as a problem appears. External Complaint Mechanism The Chief District Officer (“CDO”) of the concerned district is the initial complaint handling authority. If an employee is not satisfied with the decision of management, he/she can adopt the external mechanism. The Kantipur Publication's Rules on Sexual Harassment Firstly, we encourage everyone to speak up against the ongoing harassment (if any). The cases of harassment cannot be known until it is proclaimed. Hence, the issue needs to be brought forward either by the victim or the witness. To avoid harassment, think about how & what you say or do will make the other person feel. For example, whether you are making a sexist joke about women doing household chores or flirting and making sexual comments, if that makes your colleagues uncomfortable or unsafe, you need to stop. Also, the person who feels uncomfortable have to stop that person from saying such comments. If he/she does not stop despite of several warnings, then he/she should report to concerned HOD or HR Department. No incident of harassment will be taken lightly. We will listen to every claim, investigate anyone who is accused, and penalise the offenders appropriately. We will consider every harassment claim legit unless proven otherwise in the course of our investigation. Those who ignore and idly watch sexual harassment are equally at fault. All bureau chiefs and section editors are responsible for preventing sexual harassment in the newsroom and immediately reporting cases of violations to the editor-in-chief. Encouraging harassment by laughing and/or ignoring makes the discomfort and pain to the person who is being harassed worse. Anyone who witnesses an incident of harassment or has corroboration should report to the respective HOD. Regardless of the position in the company and years of experience, employees will face strict disciplinary action (which may range from demotion, suspension, withheld of grade, withheld of promotion to termination depending upon the level of accusation) if they are found guilty. Anyone found guilty of severe harassment of any sort will be terminated. If anyone outside the company harasses our employees during the course of reporting, we will officially report that that the respective organisation takes necessary disciplinary action and lawful actions are taken against in case of individual perpetrators. If anyone outside the company harasses our employees during the course of reporting, we will officially report that that the respective organisation takes necessary disciplinary action and lawful actions are taken against in case of individual perpetrators. If anyone makes a false complaint and allegation of harassment intentionally and knowingly against someone who is innocent/not guilty, then the person who filed the complaint will be liable for the necessary disciplinary action. Harassment of any kind won’t be tolerated; it will be investigated fairly and justly. What about harassment outside the office premises? There is a list of things you can do to reduce and prevent the chance of being harassed when you’re out reporting, photographing, or simply meeting a prospective source. The Dart Center for Journalism & Trauma at Columbia Journalism School has a great tip sheet, based on interviews with leading women journalists, to help reporters recognise, mitigate and address sexual harassment when you’re on assignment. Here are some helpful tips: Choose safe meeting places. When you’re meeting a source you don’t know, consider opting for a public place, like a restaurant, even if a home or in a private location might seem more attractive for an interview. Avoid situations that the source may interpret as falling outside professional bounds, in terms of location or timing. For example, if pressed to meet over evening drinks, you can say you’re on deadline and suggest breakfast or lunch instead. That’s not only a safer setting - it also signals that you’re setting boundaries. Avoid being alone with any individual you don’t know or trust. Avoid inviting sources – or your fixer, translator or driver – to your hotel room, and don’t go to their place unless you know and trust them. If necessary, have a colleague or friend accompany you under the pretence of being a photographer or a note taker. Having another “journalist” present makes clear this is a work meeting. If that’s not an option, ask friends or colleagues to call you every 20-30 minutes; when you answer, you can say, “Sorry, I’m conducting the interview I told you about.” It may interrupt the flow, but will also signal that others are aware of your whereabouts. If you must meet in a hotel room, ask room service to stop by every 20 minutes, to replenish your tea or water or to bring in fresh coffee, so your source understands he is not really alone with you. If you’re going to a remote or private place to report, alert friends/colleagues. Let them know where you’re going, whom you’re meeting or interviewing, and what time you expect to return. Keep updating frequently to your immediate supervisor about your whereabouts. Mentally prepare yourself to cope with possible difficulties, always equipped with necessary equipment like extra mobile phone, power bank, important phone numbers and contact of local police. Dress and act neutrally and professionally. Especially when meeting a source for the first time, many journalists choose to dress conservatively or androgynously. Set boundaries right at the beginning, through your words, tone, body language, and clothing. Maintain a professional distance in relationships with sources – friendly but serious, and not too chummy. Clarify intent early on. To avoid any potential misconceptions, especially if you’re reporting in a culture where you are unfamiliar with social signals and cues, be explicit at the outset that this is a work appointment – that you’re looking for X information for Y reason. Because of a cultural divide, you may have to underscore that message several times. Network. Tap into or build a community of women in journalism, and trusted colleagues generally. Share information about colleagues and sources who are predatory, have poor social boundaries or make sexist or sexual comments. Seek and provide emotional support. Be an active bystander. Stand up for those you see being harassed, report these behaviours to supervisors, and press others – including men – to speak up when they see/hear sexist comments or harassment. Evaluate risks versus benefits. If you have reason to think you could be in danger and you can’t find ways to sufficiently mitigate that risk, seriously consider whether this particular story or interview is worth it. Look hard for alternate ways to get the information: interview other sources, or when possible, rely on phone or video calls instead of in-person meetings. Err on the side of safety. For a detailed guideline on how to maintain relationships with your sources, supervisors and colleagues in the newsroom, please read and share this resource guide—http://bit.ly/newsroom-harassment—by the Dart Center.","harassment, the, sexual, complaint, your, kantipur, workplace, comments, conduct, mechanism, individual, sexist, hod, dart, publication, physical, any, source, person, an"

Cane farmers to receive subsidy of Rs60 per quintal By Navin Poudel Sugarcane farmers will now receive a subsidy of Rs60 per quintal, according to the provision put forth by the Cabinet which met last Friday. The move is expected to provide some respite to sugarcane producers who are facing late payments from sugar mills yet again. Cooperative-run fair price shops shut down By Navin Poudel Most of the fair price shops operated by cooperatives with government grants have shut down, marking a failure of the programme to make essential goods available at low cost to low-income groups. The cooperatives received Rs100,000 each to establish these outlets. Sugarcane farmers protest demanding Rs80 million By Navin Poudel Sugarcane famers of Nawalparasi district have staged a sit-in at the entrance of Indira Sugar Mill demanding payment for their crop. The protest was held after the mill failed to release the payment of around Rs80 million to sugarcane farmers, who had supplied the crop three months ago. Sugarcane farming loses steam due to price uncertainty By Navin Poudel Sugarcane farmers of Nawalparasi district have not been able to sell their produce so far, as the government is yet to fix the price of the crop for this fiscal year. This has raised the spectre of the crop drying in the fields.

By Prateebha Tuladhar By the time I finish telling my favourite umbrella story, we’ve managed to hail a taxi and gotten in. I knew it was going to be a story with a happy ending, you say.

It didn’t occur to her that the move would only cause her object of dedication to further stiffen against her. We are conversation By Prateebha Tuladhar You always came to me for conversations. You knew that was all I ever had, to offer. And that’s exactly why you came around this time as well. To converse. To find distraction.

Choosing the right counsellor By Dipesh Tandukar Finding a counsellor can be overwhelming, but it is important to ensure they are qualified and the right fit for your needs. When does counselling fail? By Dipesh Tandukar We often hear people claim that therapy is ineffective. While this maybe a personal opinion, it highlights the fact that counselling may not meet the needs of every individual. Why you should reach out for help By Dipesh Tandukar Asking for help is often one of the most difficult things for people to do. So, we need to be able to respond without prejudice or bias. Mental health support in schools By Dipesh Tandukar Schools should do more to ensure a stress-free environment for students to learn and grow, rather than obsess over studies. The monetisation of mental health By Dipesh Tandukar Counselling is rooted in the belief of understanding and helping clients. This makes it challenging to assign a price to it. Avoiding the pitfall of pseudo-expertise By Dipesh Tandukar It’s excellent that people are becoming more aware of mental health. However, you shouldn’t always take advice based on the experiences of other. Even if the symptoms seem similar, people’s situations can vastly differ.","dipesh, tandukar, counsellor, men, counselling, needs, monetisation, pitfall, fit, mental, health, schools, finding, pressures, symptoms, the, situations, stress, experiences, belief"
