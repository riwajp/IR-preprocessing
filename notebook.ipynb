      "KATHMANDU, FEBRUARY 20 Five separate reports were presented on Tuesday at the Nepali Congress (NC) Mahasamiti Meeting, which commenced on Monday in Godavari, Lalitpur. According to the NC, party Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister Purna Bahadur Khadka shared the Policy Report, while General Secretary Gagan Thapa tabled the Organizational Proposal. Likewise, another General Secretary, Bishow Prakash Sharma, shared the Contemporary Political Report, and NC Spokesperson and Finance Minister Dr. Prakash Sharan Mahat presented the Report on Nepal's Present Economic Status, Possibilities, and Future Course. Similarly, Accounts Committee Coordinator Shyam Kumar Ghimire tabled the party's Audit Report, outlining the state of the party's economic status, sources of income, and expenses. In his report, Vice President Khadka proposed that the Mahasamiti Meeting should make decisions to address the questions and difficulties emerging at the national level and within the party's internal affairs. General Secretary Thapa called for making the party a torchbearer of social transformation and linking it to the social movement. He added that the NC's organization should be strengthened to contest the upcoming polls without forming electoral alliances with other parties. General Secretary Sharma emphasized that the NC has the responsibility to work for the country and its people while maintaining the existing ruling alliance, given that no single party holds a majority in parliament. Spokesperson Dr. Mahat stated that the NC remains committed to ensuring social security and advocated for the party to embrace the ideals of democratic socialism. The reports will be discussed starting Wednesday, as per the NC's announcement.\n",
      "KATHMANDU, SEPTEMBER 21 Thousands of public school teachers continued their Kathmandu centric protest today as well for the second day expressing dissatisfaction with some of the provisions in the School Education Bill registered at the House of Representatives. Thousands of teachers across the country have come to the capital upon the call from Nepal Teachers' Federation to protest against the Bill. Participants gathered around Maitighar area at 10:00am and marched to Baneshwor. Like yesterday, agitated teachers obstructed road segments for hours affecting traffic in the area for almost the whole day until the teachers finally returned. The NTF had asked all the teachers to join the protest after rejecting the call for dialogue from the Minister of Education, Science and Technology. Today, the NTF members held meeting with Education Minister Ashok Rai and Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha. Butthe teachers' representative came out of the meeting. They have said that they will not sit for discussion until the Bill is withdrawn from the HoR. Teachers have majorly demanded that the provisions allowing the local government to take charge of school management, teachers' appointment, school principal's appointment, teachers' transfer, demotion and dismissal be amended. They have demanded that all these roles be handled by the federal government like issues of civil servants. Although the government had previously agreed to these demands, the Bill registered at the HoR does not include them. Teachers have accused the government of cheating them in this regard and deliberately bringing these provisions. Teachers have said that allowing the local governments to appoint teachers will not guarantee competence of teachers and more of them are likely to become political cadres. The protest has affected studies in over 26,000 public schools and over 5.50 million students across the country. A version of this article appears in the print on September 22, 2023, of The Himalayan Times.\n"
